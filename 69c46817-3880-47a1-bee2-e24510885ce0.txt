======================================================== thing as one object being objectively more beautiful than another.  Mathematics has its proofs (so the argument goes), and science has its  experimental tests; but if you choose to believe that Mozart was an  inept and cacophonous composer then neither logic nor experiment  nor anything else objective will ever contradict you.  However, it would be a mistake to dismiss the possibility of objective  beauty for that sort of reason, for it is none other than the relic of  empiricism that I discussed in Chapter 9 – the assertion that philo- sophical knowledge in general cannot exist. It is true that, just as one  cannot  deduce  moral maxims from scientific theories, likewise nor can  one deduce aesthetic values. But that would not prevent aesthetic truths  from being linked to physical facts through explanations, as moral  ones are. Wheeler was very nearly asserting such a link in that quotation.  Facts can be used to criticize aesthetic theories, as they can moral  theories. For instance, there is the criticism that, since most arts depend  on parochial properties of human senses (such as which range of  colours and sounds they can detect), they cannot be attaining anything  objective. Extraterrestrial people whose senses detected radio waves  but not light or sound would have art that was inaccessible to us, and  vice versa. And the reply to that criticism might be, first, that perhaps  our arts are merely scratching the surface of what is possible: they are  indeed parochial, but they are a first approximation to something  universal. Or, second, that deaf composers on Earth have composed,  and appreciated, great music; why could deaf extraterrestrials (or  humans who were born deaf) not learn to do the same – if by no other  means than by downloading a set of deaf-composer aesthetics into  their brains? Or, third, what is the difference between using radio  telescopes to understand the physics of quasars and using prosthetic  senses (wired into the brain to create new qualia) to appreciate extra- terrestrial art? 355 Why are Flowers Beautiful?  Experience may also provide artistic  problems . Our ancestors had  eyes and paint, which may have led them to wonder how paint could  be used in a way that would look more beautiful. Just as Bronowski pointed out that scientific discovery depends on  a commitment to certain moral values, might it not also entail the  appreciation of certain forms of beauty? It is a fact – often mentioned  but seldom explained – that deep truth is often beautiful. Mathemat- icians and theoretical scientists call this form of beauty ‘elegance’.  Elegance is the beauty in explanations. It is by no means synonymous  with how good, or how true, an explanation is. The poet John Keats’  assertion (which I think was ironic) that ‘Beauty is truth, truth beauty’  is refuted by what the evolutionist Thomas Huxley called ‘the great  tragedy of Science – the slaying of a beautiful hypothesis by an ugly  fact – which is so constantly being enacted under the eyes of philo- sophers’. (By ‘philosophers’ he meant ‘scientists’.) I think Huxley, too  was being ironic in calling this process a great tragedy, especially since  he was referring to the refutation of spontaneous-generation theories.  But it is true that some important mathematical proofs, and some  scientific theories, are far from elegant. Yet the truth so often  is  elegant  that elegance is, at least, a useful heuristic when searching for funda- mental truths. And when a ‘beautiful hypothesis’ is slain, it is more  often than not replaced, as the spontaneous-generation theory was, by  a more beautiful one. Surely this is not coincidence: it is a regularity  in nature. So it must have an explanation. The processes of science and art can look rather different: a new  artistic creation rarely proves an old one wrong; artists rarely look at a  scene through microscopes, or understand a sculpture through equations.  Yet scientific and artistic creation do sometimes look remarkably alike.  Richard Feynman once remarked that the only equipment a theoretical  physicist needs is a stack of paper, a pencil and a waste-paper basket,  and some artists, when they are at work, closely resemble that picture.  Before the invention of the typewriter, novelists used exactly the same  equipment.  Composers like Ludwig van Beethoven agonized through change  after change, apparently seeking something that they knew was there  to be created, apparently meeting a standard that could be met only  after much creative effort and much failure. Scientists often do the  356 the beginning of infinity same. In both science and art there are the exceptional creators like  Mozart or the mathematician Srinivasa Ramanujan, who reputedly  made brilliant contributions without any such effort. But from what  we know of knowledge-creation we have to conclude that in such cases  the effort, and the mistakes, did happen, invisibly, inside their brains. Are these resemblances======================================================== thought to be achieved in part by  a system based on ‘mirror neurons’. These are neurons that fire when  an animal performs a given action, and also when the animal perceives  the same action being performed by another. These neurons have been  406 the beginning of infinity identified experimentally in animals that have the capacity to imitate.  Scientists who believe that human meme replication is a sophisticated  form of imitation tend to believe that mirror neurons are a key to  understanding all sorts of functions of the human mind. Unfortunately,  that cannot possibly be so. It is not known  why  parroting evolved. It is a fairly common adap- tation in birds, and may play more than one role. But, whatever the  reason, the important thing for present purposes is that parrots never  have a choice about which sounds to imitate, or about what constitutes  imitating them. A ringing doorbell and a barking dog may happen    to provide conditions that meet the inborn criterion that initiates  parroting behaviour, and, when they do, the parrot will always mimic  exactly the same aspects of them: their sounds. So, it resolves the infinite  ambiguity by making no choices. It does not occur to it to ignore the  dog under those conditions, or to imitate the wagging of its tail, because  it is incapable of conceiving of any other criterion for imitation than  the one built into its mirror-neuron system. It is devoid of creativity  and  relies  on its lack of creativity to replicate the sounds faithfully.  This is reminiscent of humans in static societies – except for a crucial  difference which I shall explain below. Now, imagine that a parrot had been present at Popper’s lectures,  and learned to parrot some of Popper’s favourite sentences. It would,  in a sense, have ‘imitated’ some of Popper’s ideas: in principle, an  interested student could later learn the ideas by listening to the parrot.  But the parrot would merely be transmitting those memes from one  place to another – which is no more than the air in the lecture theatre  does. The parrot could not be said to have acquired the memes, because  it would be reproducing only one of the countless behaviours that they  could produce. The parrot’s subsequent behaviour as a result of having  learned the sounds by heart – such as its responses to questions – would  not resemble Popper’s. The sound of the meme would be there, but its  meaning would not. And it is the meaning – the knowledge – that is  the replicator. The parrot is oblivious to the human meanings of the sounds that  it parrots. Had those lectures been not about philosophy but about  recipes for fried parrot, it would have been just as eager to quote from  them to anyone who would listen. But it is not  oblivious  to the content  407 The Evolution of Creativity of the sound – it is not like a mechanical recorder. Quite the contrary:  parrots neither record sounds indiscriminately nor replay them ran  - domly. Their inborn criteria do implicitly attribute meaning to sounds  that they hear; it is just that the meaning is always drawn from the  same, narrow set of possibilities: if the evolutionary function of par  - roting is, for instance, to create identifying calls, then every sound it  hears is either a potential identifying call or not. Apes are capable of recognizing a much larger set of possible  meanings. Some of them are so complex that aping has often been  misinterpreted as evidence of human-like understanding. For example,  when an ape learns a new method of cracking nuts by hitting them  with rocks, it does not then play the movements back blindly in a fixed  sequence like a parrot does. The movements required to crack the nut  are never the same twice: the ape has to  aim  the rock at the nut; it may  have to  chase  the nut and fetch it back if it rolls away; it has to keep  hitting it until it cracks, rather than a fixed number of times; and so  on. During some parts of the procedure the ape’s two hands must  cooperate, each performing a different sub-task. Before it can even  begin, it must be able to recognize a nut as being suitable for the  procedure; it must look for a rock and, again, recognize a suitable one.  Such activities may seem to depend on explanation – on understand-  ing how and why each action within the complex behaviour has to fit  in with the other actions in order to achieve the overall purpose. But  recent discoveries have revealed how apes are able to imitate such  behaviours without ever creating any explanatory knowledge. In a  remarkable series of observational and theoretical studies, the evo  - lutionary psychologist and animal-behaviour researcher Richard Byrne  has shown how they achieve this by a process that he calls  behaviour  parsing  (which is analogous to the grammatical analysis or ‘parsing’  of human speech or computer programs).  Humans and computers separate continuous streams of sounds or  characters into individual elements such as words, and======================================================== for how to thrive at a higher  temperature. And not at all costs, but efficiently and cheaply. Some  such plans exist – for instance to remove carbon dioxide from the  atmosphere by a variety of methods; and to generate clouds over the  oceans to reflect sunlight; and to encourage aquatic organisms to  absorb more carbon dioxide. But at the moment these are very minor  research efforts. Neither supercomputers nor international treaties nor  vast sums are devoted to them. They are not central to the human  effort to face this problem, or problems like it.  This is dangerous. There is as yet no serious sign of retreat into a  sustainable lifestyle (which would really mean achieving only the  semblance  of sustainability), but even the aspiration is dangerous.  For what would we be aspiring to? To forcing the future world into  our image, endlessly reproducing our lifestyle, our misconceptions  and our mistakes. But if we choose instead to embark on an open- ended journey of creation and exploration whose every step is un  -  sustainable until it is redeemed by the next – if this becomes the  prevailing ethic and aspiration of our society – then the ascent of  man, the beginning of infinity, will have become, if not secure, then  at least sustainable.  terminology The ascent of man  The beginning of infinity. Moreover, Jacob  Bronowski’s  The Ascent of Man  was one of the inspirations for this  book.

Analogies between such societies and the technological  civilization of the West today are therefore fallacies. Marx, Engels and  Diamond’s ‘ultimate explanation’ of the different histories of different  societies is false: history is the history of ideas, not of the mechanical  effects of biogeography. Strategies to prevent foreseeable disasters are  bound to fail eventually, and cannot even address the unforeseeable.  To prepare for those, we need rapid progress in science and technology  and as much wealth as possible. 443 18 The Beginning ‘This is Earth. Not the eternal and only home of mankind, but  only a starting point of an infinite adventure. All you need do  is make the decision [to end your static society]. It is yours  to make.’ [With that decision] came the end, the final end of Eternity.  – And the beginning of Infinity. Isaac Asimov,  The End of Eternity  (1955) The first person to measure the circumference of the Earth was the  astronomer Eratosthenes of Cyrene, in the third century  bce.  His result  was fairly close to the actual value, which is about 40,000 kilometres.  For most of history this was considered an enormous distance, but with  the Enlightenment that conception gradually changed, and nowadays  we think of the Earth as small. That was brought about mainly by two  things: first, by the science of astronomy, which discovered titanic  entities compared with which our planet is indeed unimaginably tiny;  and, second, by technologies that have made worldwide travel and  communication commonplace. So the Earth has become smaller both  relative to the universe and relative to the scale of human action.  Thus, in regard to the  geography  of the universe and to our place in  it, the prevailing world view has rid itself of some parochial mis  - conceptions. We know that we have explored almost the whole surface  of that formerly enormous sphere; but we also know that there are far  more places left to explore in the universe (and beneath the surface of  the Earth’s land and oceans) than anyone imagined while we still had  those misconceptions.  444 the beginning of infinity In regard to theoretical knowledge, however, the prevailing world  view has not yet caught up with Enlightenment values. Thanks to the  fallacy and bias of prophecy, a persistent assumption remains that our  existing theories are at or fairly close to the limit of what it is knowable  – that we are  nearly there ,   or perhaps halfway there. As the economist  David Friedman has remarked, most people believe that an income of  about twice their own should be sufficient to satisfy any reasonable  person, and that no genuine benefit can be derived from amounts above  that. As with wealth, so with scientific knowledge: it is hard to imagine  what it would be like to know twice as much as we do, and so if we  try to prophesy it we find ourselves just picturing the next few decimal  places of what we already know. Even Feynman made an uncharacter- istic mistake in this regard when he wrote: I think there will certainly not be======================================================== counter-intuitive properties, some of which are illustrated by  Hilbert’s thought experiment of Infinity Hotel. One of them is that, if  195 A Window on Infinity unlimited progress really is going to happen, not only are we now at  almost the very beginning of it, we always shall be. Cantor proved, with  his diagonal argument, that there are infinitely many levels of infinity,  of which physics uses at most the first one or two: the infinity of the  natural numbers and the infinity of the continuum. Where there are  infinitely many identical copies of an observer (for instance in multiple  universes), probability and proportions do not make sense unless the  collection as a whole has a structure subject to laws of physics that give  them meaning. A mere infinite sequence of universes, like the rooms in    In  finity Hotel, does not have such structure, which means that anthropic  reasoning by itself is insufficient to explain the apparent ‘fine-tuning’  of the constants of physics. Proof is a physical process: whether a  mathematical proposition is provable or unprovable, de    cidable or  undecidable, depends on the laws of physics, which determine which  abstract entities and relationships are modelled by physical objects.  Similarly, whether a task or pattern is simple or complex depends on  what the laws of physics are. 196 9 Optimism The possibilities that lie in the future are infinite. When I say  ‘It is our duty to remain optimists,’ this includes not only the  openness of the future but also that which all of us contribute  to it by everything we do: we are all responsible for what the  future holds in store. Thus it is our duty, not to prophesy evil  but, rather, to fight for a better world. Karl Popper,  The Myth of the Framework  (1994) Martin Rees suspects that civilization was lucky to survive the twentieth  century. For throughout the Cold War there was always a possibility  that another world war would break out, this time fought with hydrogen  bombs, and that civilization would be destroyed. That danger seems to  have receded, but in Rees’s book  Our Final Century , published in 2003,  he came to the worrying conclusion that civilization now had only a  50 per cent chance of surviving the twenty-first century.  Again this was because of the danger that newly created knowledge  would have catastrophic consequences. For example, Rees thought it  likely that civilization-destroying weapons, particularly biological ones,  would soon become so easy to make that terrorist organizations, or  even malevolent individuals, could not be prevented from acquiring  them. He also feared accidental catastrophes, such as the escape of  genetically modified micro-organisms from a laboratory, resulting in  a pandemic of an incurable disease. Intelligent robots, and nano- technology (engineering on the atomic scale), ‘could in the long run be  even more threatening’, he wrote. And ‘it is not inconceivable that  physics could be dangerous too.’ For instance, it has been suggested  197 Optimism that elementary-particle accelerators that briefly create conditions that  are in some respects more extreme than any since the Big Bang might  destabilize the very vacuum of space and destroy our entire universe.  Rees pointed out that, for his conclusion to hold, it is not necessary  for any one of those catastrophes to be at all probable, because we  need be unlucky only once, and we incur the risk afresh every time  progress is made in a variety of fields. He compared this with playing  Russian roulette.  But there is a crucial difference between the human condition and  Russian roulette: the probability of winning at Russian roulette is  unaffected by anything that the player may think or do. Within its  rules, it is a game of pure chance. In contrast, the future of civilization  depends entirely on what we think and do. If civilization falls, that will  not be something that just happens to us: it will be the outcome of  choices that people make. If civilization survives, that will be because  people succeed in solving the problems of survival, and that too will  not have happened by chance.  Both the future of civilization and the outcome of a game of Russian  roulette are unpredictable, but in different senses and for entirely  unrelated reasons. Russian roulette is merely  random . Although we  cannot predict the outcome, we do know what the possible outcomes  are, and the probability of each, provided that the rules of the game  are obeyed. The future of civilization is  unknowable , because the  knowledge that is going to affect it has yet to be created. Hence the  possible outcomes are not yet known, let alone their probabilities. The growth of knowledge cannot change that fact. On the contrary,  it contributes strongly to it: the ability of scientific theories to predict  the future depends on the reach of their explanations, but no explan- ation has enough reach to predict the content of its own successors –======================================================== structure. We do not discover new facts or new effects by copying them,  or by inferring them inductively from observation, or by any other  method of instruction by the environment. We use, rather, the method  412 the beginning of infinity of trial and the elimination of error. As Ernst Gombrich says, ‘making  comes before matching’: the active production of a new trial structure  comes before its exposure to eliminating tests. The Myth of the Framework Popper could just as well have written, ‘We do not  acquire new memes   by copying them, or by inferring them inductively from observation,  or by any other method of imitation of, or instruction by, the environ- ment.’ The transmission of human-type memes – memes whose meaning  is not mostly predefined within the receiver – cannot be other than a  creative activity on the part of the receiver. Memes, like scientific theories, are not derived from anything. They  are created afresh by the recipient. They are conjectural explanations,  which are then subjected to criticism and testing before being tentatively  adopted. This same pattern of creative conjecture, criticism and testing generates  inexplicit as well as explicit ideas. In fact all creativity does, for no    idea can be represented entirely explicitly. When we make an explicit  conjecture, it has an inexplicit component whether we are aware of it  or not. And so does all criticism. Thus, as has so often happened in the history of universality, the human  capacity for universal explanation did not evolve to have a universal  function. It evolved simply to increase the volume of memetic information  that our ancestors could acquire, and the speed and accuracy which they  could acquire it. But since the easiest way for evolution to do that was  to give us a universal ability to explain, through creativity, that is what  it did. This epistemological fact provides not only the solution of the  two puzzles I mentioned, but also the reason for the evolution of human  creativity – and therefore the human species – in the first place.  It must have happened something like this. In early pre-human  societies, there were only very simple memes – the kind that apes now  have, though perhaps with a wider repertoire of copiable elementary  behaviours. Those memes were about practical things like how to get  food that was otherwise inaccessible. The value of such knowledge  must have been high, so this created a ready-made niche for any  adaptation that would reduce the effort required to replicate memes.  Creativity was the ultimate adaptation to fill that niche. As it increased,  413 The Evolution of Creativity further adaptations co-evolved, such as an increase in memory capacity  (to store more memes), finer motor control, and specialized brain  structures for dealing with language. As a result, the meme band-  width (the amount of memetic information that could be passed from    each generation to the next) increased too. Memes also became more  complex and sophisticated. This is why and how our species evolved, and why it evolved rapidly  – at first. Memes gradually came to dominate our ancestors’ behaviour.  Meme evolution took place, and, like all evolution, this was always in  the direction of greater faithfulness. This meant becoming ever more  anti-rational. At some point, meme evolution achieved static societies  – presumably they were tribes. Consequently, all those increases in  creativity never produced streams of innovations. Innovation remained  imperceptibly slow, even as the capacity for it was increasing rapidly. Even in a static society, memes still evolve, due to imperceptible  errors of replication. They just evolve more slowly than anyone can  notice: imperceptible errors cannot be suppressed. They would generally  evolve towards greater fidelity of replication, as usual with evolution,  and hence to greater staticity of the society. Status in such a society is reduced by transgressing people’s ex    - pectations of proper behaviour, and is improved by meeting them.  There would have been the expectations of parents, priests, chiefs and  potential mates (or whoever controlled mating in that society) – who  were themselves conforming to the wishes and expectations of the  society at large. Those people’s opinions would determine one’s ability  to eat, thrive and reproduce, and hence the fate of one’s genes. But how does one discover the wishes and expectations of other  people? They might issue commands, but they could never specify every  detail of what they expected, let alone every detail of how to achieve  it. When one is commanded to do something (or expected to, as a  condition for being considered worthy of food or mating, for instance),  one might remember seeing an already-respected person doing the  same thing, and one might try to emulate that person. To do that  effectively, one would have to understand what the point of doing it  was, and to try to achieve  that  as best one======================================================== sufficient detail to  test most of our present-day theories of astrophysics and cosmology.  Even aside from those billion tonnes of matter, the cube is not empty.  It is full of faint light, and the amount of evidence in that light is  staggering: enough to construct a map of every star, planet and moon  in all the nearest galaxies to a resolution of about ten kilometres. To  extract that evidence in full, the telescope would need to use something  like a mirror of the same width as the cube itself, which would require  at least as much matter as building a planet. But even that would not  be beyond the bounds of possibility, given the level of technology    we are considering. To gather that much matter, those intergalactic  scientists would merely have to trawl out to a distance of a few  thousand cube-widths – still a piffling distance by intergalactic stand- ards. But even with a mere million-tonne telescope they could do a lot  of astronomy. The fact that planets with tilted axes have annual seasons  would be plain to see. They could detect life if it was present on any  of the planets, via the composition of its atmosphere. With more subtle  measurements they could test theories about the nature and history of  life – or intelligence – on the planet. At any instant, a typical cube  contains evidence, at that level of detail, about more than a trillion  stars and their planets, simultaneously. And that is only one instant. Additional evidence of all those kinds  is pouring into the cube all the time, so astronomers there could track  changes in the sky just as we do. And visible light is only one band of  the electromagnetic spectrum. The cube is receiving evidence in every  other band too – gamma rays, X-rays, all the way down to the micro- wave background radiation and radio waves, as well as a few cosmic- ray particles. In short, nearly all the channels by which we on Earth  currently receive evidence about any of the fundamental sciences are  available in intergalactic space too. And they carry much the same content: not only is the universe full  69 The Spark of evidence, it is full of the same evidence everywhere. All people in  the universe, once they have understood enough to free themselves  from parochial obstacles, face essentially the same opportunities.This  is an underlying unity in the physical world more significant than all  the dissimilarities I have described between our environment and a  typical one: the fundamental laws of nature are so uniform, and  evidence about them so ubiquitous, and the connections between  understanding and control so intimate, that, whether we are on our  parochial home planet or a hundred million light years away in the  intergalactic plasma, we can do the same science and make the same  progress. So a typical location in the universe is amenable to the open-ended  creation of knowledge. And therefore so are almost all other kinds of  environment, since they have more matter, more energy and easier  access to evidence than intergalactic space. The thought experiment  considered almost the worst possible case. Perhaps the laws of physics  do not allow knowledge-creation inside, say, the jet of a quasar. Or  perhaps they do. But either way, in the universe at large, knowledge- friendliness is the rule, not the exception. That is to say, the rule is  person-friendliness  to people who have the relevant knowledge . Death  is the rule for those who do not. These are the same rules that prevailed  in the Great Rift Valley from whence we came, and have prevailed    ever since. Oddly enough, that quixotic space station in our thought experiment  is none other than the ‘generation ship’ in the Spaceship Earth metaphor  – except that we have removed the unrealistic assumption that the  inhabitants never improve it. Hence presumably they have long since  solved the problem of how to avoid dying, and so ‘generations’ are no  longer essential to the way their ship works. In any case, with hindsight,  a generation ship was a poor choice for dramatizing the claim that the  human condition is fragile and dependent on support from an unaltered  biosphere, for that claim is contradicted by the very possibility of such  a spaceship. If it is possible to live indefinitely in a spaceship in space,  then it would be much more possible to use the same technology to  live on the surface of the Earth – and to make continuing progress  which would make it ever easier. It would make little practical difference  whether the biosphere had been ruined or not. Whether or not it could  70 the beginning of infinity support any other species, it could certainly accommodate people –  including humans – if they had the right knowledge.  Now I can turn to the significance of knowledge – and therefore of  people – in the cosmic scheme of things.  Many things are more  obviously  significant than people. Space and  time are significant because they appear in almost all explanations of  other======================================================== often  do this  by imparting useful functionality to their organism, and in those cases  *This terminology differs slightly from that of Dawkins. Anything that is copied,    for whatever reason, he calls a replicator. What I call a replicator he calls an ‘active    replicator’. 94 the beginning of infinity their knowledge incidentally includes knowledge about that functionality.  Functionality, in turn, is achieved by encoding, into genes, regularities  in the environment and sometimes even rule-of-thumb approximations  to laws of nature, in which case the genes are incidentally encoding that  knowledge too. But the core of the explanation for the presence of a  gene is always that it got itself replicated more than its rival genes. Non-explanatory human knowledge can also evolve in an analogous  way: rules of thumb are not passed on perfectly to the next generation  of users, and the ones that survive in the long run are not necessarily  the ones that optimize the ostensible function. For instance, a rule that  is expressed in an elegant rhyme may be remembered, and repeated,  better than one that is more accurate but expressed in ungainly prose.  Also, no human knowledge is entirely non-explanatory. There is always  at least a background of assumptions about reality against which the  meaning of a rule of thumb is understood, and that background can  make some false rules of thumb seem plausible. Explanatory theories evolve through a more complicated mechanism.  Accidental errors in transmission and memory still play a role, but a  much smaller one. That is because good explanations are hard to vary  even without being tested, and hence random errors in the transmission  of a good explanation are easier for the receiver to detect and correct.  The most important source of variation in explanatory theories is  creativity. For instance, when people are trying to understand an idea  that they hear from others, they typically understand it to mean what  makes most sense to them, or what they are most expecting to hear,  or what they fear to hear, and so on. Those meanings are conjectured  by the listener or reader, and may differ from what the speaker or  writer intended. In addition, people often try to improve explanations  even when they have received them accurately: they make creative  amendments, spurred by their own criticism. If they then pass the  explanation on to others, they usually try to pass on what they consider  to be the improved version. Unlike genes, many memes take different physical forms every time  they are replicated. People rarely express ideas in exactly the same  words in which they heard them. They also translate from one language  to another, and between spoken and written language, and so on. Yet  we rightly call what is transmitted the  same  idea – the same meme –  95 Creation throughout. Thus, in the case of most memes, the real replicator is  abstract: it is the knowledge itself. This is in principle true of genes as  well: biotechnology routinely transcribes genes into the memories of  computers, where they are stored in a different physical form. Those  records could be translated back into DNA strands and implanted in  different animals. The only reason this is not yet a common practice  is that it is easier to copy the original gene. But one day the genes of a  rare species could survive its extinction by causing themselves to be  stored on a computer and then implanted into a cell of a different  species. I say ‘causing themselves to be stored’ because the biotech- nologists would not be recording information indiscriminately, but  only information that met a criterion such as ‘gene of an endangered  species’. The ability to interest biotechnologists in this way would then  be part of the reach of the knowledge in those genes.  So, both human knowledge and biological adaptations are abstract  replicators: forms of information which, once they are embodied in a  suitable physical system, tend to remain so while most variants of them  do not. The fact that the principles of neo-Darwinist theory are, from a  certain perspective, self-evident has itself been used as a criticism of  the theory. For instance, if the theory  must  be true, how can it be  testable? One reply, often attributed to Haldane, is that the whole  theory would be refuted by the discovery of a single fossilized rabbit  in a stratum of Cambrian rock. However, that is misleading. The import  of such an observation would depend on what explanations were  available under the given circumstances. For instance, misidentifications  of fossils, and of strata, have sometimes been made and would have  to be ruled out by good explanations before one could call the discovery  ‘a fossilized rabbit in Cambrian rock’.  Even given such explanations, what would have been ruled out by  the rabbit would be not the theory of evolution itself, but only the  prevailing theory of the history of life and geological processes======================================================== hostile that they barely permit astrophysicists  at all. So, if we imagine all the values consistent with the emergence of  astrophysicists arrayed on a line, then the anthropic explanation leads  us to expect the measured value to fall at some typical point, not too  close to the middle or to either end. 100 the beginning of infinity However – and here we are reaching Sciama’s main conclusion – that  prediction changes radically if there are  several  constants to explain.  For although any one constant is unlikely to be near the edge of its  range, the more constants there are, the more likely it is that at least  one of them will be. This can be illustrated pictorially as follows, with  our bull’s-eye replaced by a line segment, a square, a cube . . . and we  can imagine this sequence continuing for as many dimensions as there  are fine-tuned constants in nature. Arbitrarily define ‘near the edge’ as  meaning ‘within 10 per cent of the whole range from it’. Then in the  case of one constant, as shown in the diagram, 20 per cent of its possible  values are near one of the two edges of the range, and 80 per cent are  ‘away from the edge’. But with two constants a pair of values has to  satisfy two constraints in order to be ‘away from the edge’. Only 64  per cent of them do so. Hence 36 per cent are near the edge. With three  constants, nearly half the possible choices are near the edge. With 100  constants, over 99.9999999 per cent of them are. Whatever anthropic reasoning predicts about the values of multiple    constants, it predicts will only just happen. So, the more constants are involved, the closer to having no astro- physicists a typical universe- with -astrophysicists is. It is not known  how many constants are involved, but it seems to be several, in which  101 Creation case the overwhelming majority of universes in the anthropically  selected region would be close to its edge. Hence, Sciama concluded,  the anthropic explanation predicts that the universe is  only just  capable  of producing astrophysicists – almost the opposite prediction from the  one that it makes in the case of one constant. On the face of it, this might in turn seem to explain another great  unsolved scientific mystery, known as ‘Fermi’s problem’, named after  the physicist Enrico Fermi, who is said to have asked, ‘ Where are they? ’  Where are the extraterrestrial civilizations? Given the Principle of  Mediocrity, or even just what we know of the galaxy and the universe,  there is no reason to believe that the phenomenon of astrophysicists  is unique to our planet. Similar conditions presumably exist in many  other solar systems, so why would some of them not produce similar  outcomes? Moreover, given the timescales on which stars and galaxies  develop, it is overwhelmingly unlikely that any given extraterrestrial  civilization is currently at a similar state of technological development  to ours: it is likely to be millions of years younger (i.e. non-existent)  or older. The older civilizations have had plenty of time to explore the  galaxy – or at least to send robot space probes or signals. Fermi’s  problem is that we do not see any such civilizations, probes or signals.  Many candidate explanations have been proposed, and none of them,  so far, are very good. The anthropic explanation of fine-tuning, in the  light of Sciama’s argument, might seem to solve the problem neatly:    if the constants of physics in our universe are only just capable of  producing astrophysicists, then it is not surprising that this event has  happened only once, since its happening twice independently in the  same universe would be vanishingly unlikely. Unfortunately, that turns out to be a bad explanation too, because  focusing on fundamental  constants  is parochial: there is no relevant  difference between (1) ‘the same’ laws of physics with different constants  and (2) different laws of physics. And there are infinitely many logically  possible laws of physics. If they were all instantiated in real universes  – as has been suggested by some cosmologists, such as Max Tegmark –    it would be statistically certain that our universe is exactly on the edge  of the astrophysicist-producing class of universes.  We know that that cannot be so from an argument due to Feynman  (which he applied to a slightly different problem). Consider the class  102 the beginning of infinity of all possible universes that contain astrophysicists, and consider what  else  most of them contain. In particular, consider a sphere just large  enough to contain your own brain. If you are interested in explaining  fine-tuning, your brain in its current state counts as an ‘astrophysicist’  for these purposes. In the class of all universes that contain astro- physicists, there are many that contain a sphere whose interior is  perfectly identical to the interior of your sphere, including every detail  of your brain. But in the vast majority of those universes there is======================================================== non-physicists  consider it self-evident that when you hold your arm out horizontally  you can  feel  the force of gravity pulling it downwards. But you cannot.  The existence of a force of gravity is, astonishingly, denied by Einstein’s  general theory of relativity, one of the two deepest theories of physics.  This says that the only force on your arm in that situation is that which  you yourself are exerting, upwards, to keep it constantly accelerating  away from the straightest possible path in a curved region of spacetime.  The reality described by our other deepest theory, quantum theory,  which I shall describe in Chapter 11, is even more counter-intuitive.  To understand explanations like those, physicists have to learn to think  about everyday events in new ways.  The guiding principle is, as always, to reject bad explanations in  favour of good ones. In regard to what is or is not real, this leads to  the requirement that, if an entity is referred to by our best explanation  in the relevant field, we must regard it as really existing. And if, as with  the force of gravity, our best explanation denies that it exists, then we  must stop assuming that it does. Furthermore, everyday events are stupendously  complex  when ex    - pressed in terms of fundamental physics. If you fill a kettle with water  and switch it on, all the supercomputers on Earth working for the age  of the universe could not solve the equations that predict what all those  water molecules will do – even if we could somehow determine their  initial state and that of all the outside influences on them, which is  itself an intractable task.  Fortunately, some of that complexity resolves itself into a higher-level  108 the beginning of infinity simplicity. For example, we  can  predict with some accuracy how long  the water will take to boil. To do so, we need know only a few physical  quantities that are quite easy to measure, such as its mass, the power  of the heating element, and so on. For greater accuracy we may also  need information about subtler properties, such as the number and type  of nucleation sites for bubbles. But those are still relatively ‘high-level’  phenomena, composed of intractably large numbers of interacting  atomic-level phenomena. Thus there is a class of high-level phenomena  – including the liquidity of water and the relation        ship between  con  tainers, heating elements, boiling and bubbles – that can be well  explained in terms of each other alone, with no direct reference to  anything at the atomic level or below. In other words, the behaviour of  that whole class of high-level phenomena is  quasi-autonomous  – almost  self-contained. This resolution into explicability at a higher, quasi- autonomous level is known as  emergence . Emergent phenomena are a tiny minority. We can predict when the  water will boil, and that bubbles will form when it does, but if you  wanted to predict where each bubble will go (or, to be precise, what  the probabilities of its various possible motions are – see Chapter 11),  you would be out of luck. Still less is it feasible to predict the countless  microscopically defined properties of the water, such as whether an  odd or an even number of its electrons will be affected by the heating  during a given period. Fortunately, we are uninterested in predicting or explaining most of  those properties, despite the fact that they are the overwhelming  majority. That is because none of them has any bearing on what we  want to do with the water – such as understand what it is made of, or  make tea. To make tea, we want the water to be boiling, but we    do not care what the pattern of bubbles was. We want its volume    to be between a certain minimum and maximum, but we do not    care how many molecules that is. We can make progress in achieving  those purposes because we can express them in terms of those quasi- autonomous emergent properties about which we have good high-level  explanations. Nor do we need most of the microscopic details in order  to understand the role of water in the cosmic scheme of things, because  nearly all of those details are parochial. The behaviour of high-level physical quantities consists of nothing  109 The Reality of Abstractions but the behaviour of their low-level constituents with most of the details  ignored. This has given rise to a widespread misconception about  emergence and explanation, known as  reductionism : the doctrine that  science always explains and predicts things reductively, i.e. by analysing  them into components. Often it does, as when we use the fact that  inter-atomic forces obey the law of conservation of energy to make  and explain a high-level prediction that the kettle cannot boil water  without a power supply. But reductionism requires the relationship  between different levels of explanation  always  to be like that, and often  it is not. For example, as I wrote in  The Fabric of Reality : Consider one======================================================== the profound  difference   between our civilization and civilizations like the one that built those  421 Unsustainable statues.  We are not like them  was his message. We have taken the step  that they did not. Attenborough’s argument rests on the opposite claim:  we are like them  and are following headlong in their footsteps. And  so he drew an extended analogy between the Easter Island civilization  and ours, feature for feature, and danger for danger: A warning of what the future could hold can be seen on one of the  remotest places on Earth . . . When the first Polynesian settlers landed  here they found a miniature world that had ample resources to sustain  them. They lived well . . . The State of the Planet  (BBC TV, 2000) A miniature world : there, in three words, is Attenborough’s reason  for travelling all the way to Easter Island and telling its story. He  believed that it holds a warning for the world because Easter Island  was itself a miniature world – a Spaceship Earth – that went wrong.  It had ‘ample resources’ to sustain its population, just as the Earth has  seemingly ample resources to sustain us. (Imagine how amazed Malthus  would have been had he known that the Earth’s resources would still  be called ‘ample’ by pessimists in the year 2000.) Its inhabitants ‘lived  well’, just as we do. And yet they were doomed, just as we are doomed  unless we change our ways. If we do not, here is ‘what the future could  hold’: The old culture that had sustained them was abandoned and the statues  toppled. What had been a rich, fertile world in miniature had become a  barren desert. Again, Attenborough puts in a good word for the old culture: it  ‘sustained’ the islanders (just as the ample resources did, until the  islanders failed to use them  sustainably ). He uses the toppling of the  statues to symbolize the fall of that culture, as if to warn of future  disaster for ours, and he reiterates his world-in-miniature analogy  between the society and technology of ancient Easter Island and that  of our whole planet today.  Thus Attenborough’s Easter Island is a variant of Spaceship Earth:  humans are sustained  jointly  by the ‘rich, fertile’ biosphere  and  the  cultural knowledge of a static society. In this context, ‘sustain’ is an  interestingly ambiguous word. It can mean providing someone with  422 the beginning of infinity what they need. But it can also mean preventing things from changing  – which can be almost the opposite meaning, for the suppression of  change is seldom what human beings need.  The knowledge that currently sustains human life in Oxfordshire  does so only in the first sense: it does not make us enact the same,  traditional way of life in every generation. In fact it prevents us from  doing so. For comparison: if your way of life merely makes you build  a new, giant statue, you can continue to live afterwards exactly as you  did before. That is  sustainable . But if your way of life leads you to  invent a more efficient method of farming, and to cure a disease that  has been killing many children, that is  unsustainable . The population  grows because children who would have died survive; meanwhile,  fewer of them are needed to work in the fields. And so there is no way  to continue as before. You have to live the solution, and to set about  solving the new problems that this creates. It is because of this unsus- tainability that the island of Britain, with a far less hospitable climate  than the subtropical Easter Island, now hosts a civilization with at  least three times the population density that Easter Island had at its  zenith, and at an enormously higher standard of living. Appropriately  enough, this civilization has knowledge of how to live well without  the forests that once covered much of Britain.  The Easter Islanders’ culture sustained them in both senses. This is  the hallmark of a functioning static society. It provided them with a  way of life; but it also inhibited change: it sustained their determination  to enact and re-enact the same behaviours for generations. It sustained  the values that placed forests – literally – beneath statues. And it  sustained the shapes of those statues, and the pointless project of  building ever more of them.  Moreover, the portion of the culture that sustained them in the sense  of providing for their needs was not especially impressive. Other Stone  Age societies have managed to take fish from the sea and sow crops  without wasting their efforts in endless monument-building. And, if the  prevailing theory is true, the Easter Islanders started to starve  before  the  fall of their civilization. In other words, even after it had stopped providing  for them, it retained its fatal proficiency at sustaining a fixed pattern of  behaviour. And so it remained effective at preventing them from addressing  the problem by the only means that could possibly have been effective:  423 Unsustainable creative thought and innovation.======================================================== fall.’ Just to correct that slightly: the physics-based explanation is true  as  well , and the physics of the dominoes is also essential to explaining  why prime numbers are relevant to that particular arrangement of  them. But Hofstadter’s argument does show that  primality  must be  part of any full explanation of why the dominos did or did not fall.  Hence it is a refutation of reductionism in regard to abstractions. For  the theory of prime numbers is not part of physics. It refers not to  physical objects, but to abstract entities – such as numbers, of which  there is an infinite set.  Unfortunately, Hofstadter goes on to disown his own argument and  to embrace reductionism. Why?  His book is primarily about one particular emergent phenomenon,  the mind – or, as he puts it, the ‘I’. He asks whether the mind can  consistently be thought of as  affecting  the body – causing it to do one  thing rather than another, given the all-embracing nature of the laws  of physics. This is known as the mind–body problem. For instance, we  often explain our actions in terms of choosing one action rather than  another, but our bodies, including our brains, are completely controlled  by the laws of physics, leaving no physical variable free for an ‘I’ to  affect in order to make such a choice. Following the philosopher Daniel  Dennett, Hofstadter eventually concludes that the ‘I’ is an illusion.  Minds, he concludes, can’t ‘push material stuff around’, be      cause  ‘physical law alone would suffice to determine [its] behaviour’. Hence  his reductionism. But, first of all, physical laws can’t push anything either. They only  explain and predict. And they are not our only explanations. The theory  118 the beginning of infinity that the domino stands ‘because 641 is a prime (and because the  domino network instantiates a primality-testing algorithm)’ is an  exceedingly good explanation. What is wrong with it? It does not  contradict the laws of physics. It explains more than any explanation  purely in terms of those laws. And no known variant of it can do the  same job. Second, that reductionist argument would equally deny that an  atom  can ‘push’ (in the sense of ‘cause to move’) another atom, since the  initial state of the universe, together with the laws of motion, has  already determined the state at every other time.  Third, the very idea of a  cause  is emergent and abstract. It is mentioned  nowhere in the laws of motion of elementary particles, and, as the  philosopher David Hume pointed out, we cannot perceive causation,  only a succession of events. Also, the laws of motion are ‘conservative’  – that is to say, they do not lose information. That means that, just as  they determine the final state of any motion given the initial state, they  also determine the initial state given the final state, and the state at any  time from the state at any other time. So, at that level of explanation,  cause and effect are interchangeable – and are not what we mean when  we say that a program causes a computer to win at chess, or that a  domino remained standing  because  641 is a prime.  There is no inconsistency in having multiple explanations of the  same phenomenon, at different levels of emergence. Regarding micro- physical explanations as more fundamental than emergent ones is  arbitrary and fallacious. There is no escape from Hofstadter’s 641  argument, and no reason to want one. The world may or may not be  as we wish it to be, and to reject good explanations on that account  is to imprison oneself in parochial error. So the answer ‘Because 641 is a prime’ does explain the immunity of  that domino. The theory of prime numbers on which that answer  depends is not a law of physics, nor an approximation to one. It is about  abstractions, and infinite sets of them at that (such as the set of ‘natural  numbers’ 1, 2, 3, .  .  . , where the ellipsis ‘ .  .  . ’ denotes continuation ad  infinitum). It is no mystery how we can have knowledge of infinitely  large things, like the set of all natural numbers. That is just a matter of  reach. Versions of number theory that confined themselves to ‘small  natural numbers’ would have to be so full of arbitrary qualifiers,  119 The Reality of Abstractions workarounds and unanswered questions that they would be very bad  explanations until they were generalized to the case that makes sense  without such ad-hoc restrictions: the infinite case. I shall discuss various  sorts of infinity in Chapter 8. When we use theories about emergent physical quantities to explain  the behaviour of water in a kettle, we are using an abstraction – an  ‘idealized’ model of the kettle that ignores most of its details – as an  approximation to a real physical system. But when we use a computer  to investigate prime numbers, we are doing the reverse: we are using  the physical computer as an approximation to an abstract one which  perfectly models prime numbers. Unlike any real computer, the latter======================================================== the laws of epistem  ology  dictate that no such memes are possible without creativity. 416 the beginning of infinity Not only is creativity necessary for human meme replication, it is  also sufficient. Deaf people and blind people and paralysed people are  still able to acquire and create human ideas to a more or less full extent.  Hence, neither upright walking nor fine motor control nor the ability  to parse sounds into words nor any of those other adaptations, though  they might have played a role historically in creating the conditions  for human evolution, were functionally necessary to allow humans to  become creative. Nor, therefore, are they philosophically significant    in understanding what humans are today, namely  people : creative,  universal explainers. It was specifically creativity that made the difference between ape  memes – expensive in terms of the time and effort required to replicate  them, and inherently limited in the knowledge that they were capable  of expressing – and human memes, which are efficiently transmitted  and universal in their expressive power. The beginning of creativity  was, in that sense, the beginning of infinity. We have no way of telling,  at present, how likely it was for creativity to begin to evolve in apes.  But, once it began to, there would automatically have been evolutionary  pressure for it to continue, and for other meme-facilitating adaptations  to follow in its wake. This increase must have continued through all  the static societies of prehistory. The horror of static societies, which I described in the previous  chapter, can now be seen as a hideous practical joke that the universe  played on the human species. Our creativity, which evolved in order  to increase the amount of knowledge that we could use, and which  would immediately have been capable of producing an endless stream  of useful innovations as well, was from the outset prevented from doing  so by the very knowledge – the memes – that that creativity preserved.  The strivings of individuals to better themselves were, from the outset,  perverted by a superhumanly evil mechanism that turned their efforts  to exactly the opposite end: to thwart all attempts at improvement; to  keep sentient beings locked in a crude, suffering state for eternity. Only  the Enlightenment, hundreds of thousands of years later, and after who  knows how many false starts, may at last have made it practical to  escape from that eternity into infinity. 417 The Evolution of Creativity terminology Imitation  Copying behaviour. This is different from human meme  replication, which copies the knowledge that is causing the behaviour. meanings of ‘the beginning of infinity’  encountered in this chapter – The evolution of creativity. –  The reassignment of creativity from its original function of preserving  memes faithfully, to the function of creating new knowledge. summary On the face of it, creativity cannot have been useful during the evolution  of humans, because knowledge was growing much too slowly for the  more creative individuals to have had any selective advantage. This is  a puzzle. A second puzzle is: how can complex memes even exist, given  that brains have no mechanism to download them from other brains?  Complex memes do not mandate specific bodily actions, but  rules.  We  can see the actions, but not the rules, so how do we replicate them?  We replicate them by creativity. That solves both problems, for  replicating memes unchanged is the function for which creativity  evolved. And that is why our species exists. 418 17 Unsustainable Easter Island in the South Pacific is famous mainly – let’s face it,  only   – for the large stone statues that were built there many centuries ago  by the islanders. The purpose of the statues is unknown, but is thought  to be connected with an ancestor-worshipping religion. The first settlers  may have arrived on the island as early as the fifth century ce. They  developed a complex Stone Age civilization, which suddenly collapsed  over a millennium later. By some accounts there was starvation, war  and perhaps cannibalism. The population fell to a small fraction of  what it had been, and their culture was lost. The prevailing theory is that the Easter Islanders brought disaster  upon themselves, in part by chopping down the forest which had  originally covered most of the island. They eliminated the most useful  species of tree altogether. This is not a wise thing to do if you rely on  timber for shelter, or if fish form a large part of your diet and your  boats and nets are made of wood. And there were knock-on effects  such as soil erosion, precipitating the destruction of the environment  on which the islanders had depended. Some archaeologists dispute this theory. For example, Terry Hunt  has concluded that the islanders arrived only in the thirteenth century,  and that their civilization continued to function throughout the defores- tation (which he attributes to======================================================== policy is bad, and to remove them without violence if they are. Just as  the institutions of science are structured so as to avoid entrenching  theories, but instead to expose them to criticism and testing, so political  institutions should not make it hard to oppose rulers and policies,  non-violently, and should embody traditions of peaceful, critical dis-  cussion of them and of the institutions themselves and everything else.  Thus, systems of government are to be judged not for their prophetic  ability to choose and install good leaders and policies, but for their  ability to remove bad ones that are already there.  That entire stance is fallibilism in action. It  assumes  that rulers and  policies are always going to be flawed – that problems are inevitable.  But it also assumes that improving upon them is possible: problems  are soluble. The ideal towards which this is working is not that nothing  212 the beginning of infinity unexpected will go wrong, but that when it does it will be an opportun- ity for further progress. Why would anyone want to make the leaders and policies that they  themselves favour more vulnerable to removal? Indeed, let me first  ask:  why would anyone want to replace bad leaders and policies at  all?  That question may seem absurd, but perhaps it is absurd only from  the perspective of a civilization that takes progress for granted. If we  did not expect progress, why should we expect the new leader or policy,  chosen by whatever method, to be any better than the old? On the  contrary, we should then expect any changes on average to do as much  harm as good. And then the precautionary principle advises, ‘Better  the devil you know than the devil you don’t.’ There is a closed loop of  ideas here: on the assumption that knowledge is not going to grow,  the precautionary principle is true; and on the assumption that the  precautionary principle is true, we cannot afford to allow knowledge  to grow. Unless a society is expecting its own future choices to be better  than its present ones, it will strive to make its present policies and  institutions as immutable as possible. Therefore Popper’s criterion can  be met only by societies that expect their knowledge to grow – and to  grow unpredictably. And, further, they are expecting that if it did grow,  that would help .  This expectation is what I call optimism, and I can state it, in its  most general form, thus: The Principle of Optimism All evils are caused by insufficient knowledge. Optimism is, in the first instance, a way of explaining failure, not  prophesying success. It says that there is no fundamental barrier, no  law of nature or supernatural decree, preventing progress. Whenever  we try to improve things and fail, it is not because the spiteful (or  unfathomably benevolent) gods are thwarting us or punishing us for  trying, or because we have reached a limit on the capacity of reason  to make improvements, or because it is best that we fail, but always  because we did not know enough, in time. But optimism is also a stance  towards the future, because nearly all failures, and nearly all successes,  are yet to come. 213 Optimism Optimism follows from the explicability of the physical world, as I  explained in Chapter 3. If something is permitted by the laws of physics,  then the only thing that can prevent it from being technologically  possible is not knowing how. Optimism also assumes that none of the  prohibitions  imposed by the laws of physics are necessarily  evils . So,  for instance, the lack of the impossible knowledge of prophecy is not  an insuperable obstacle to progress. Nor are insoluble mathematical  problems, as I explained in Chapter 8.  That means that in the long run there are no insuperable evils, and  in the short run the only insuperable evils are parochial ones. There  can be no such thing as a disease for which it is impossible to discover  a cure, other than certain types of brain damage – those that have  dissipated the knowledge that constitutes the patient’s personality. For  a sick person is a physical object, and the task of transforming this  object into the same person in good health is one that no law of physics  rules out. Hence there is a way of achieving such a transformation –  that is to say, a cure. It is only a matter of knowing how. If we do not,  for the moment, know how to eliminate a particular evil, or we know  in theory but do not yet have enough time or resources (i.e. wealth),  then, even so, it is universally true that  either  the laws of physics forbid  eliminating it in a given time with the available resources  or  there is a  way of eliminating it in the time and with those resources. The same must hold, equally trivially, for the evil of death – that is  to say, the deaths of human beings from disease or old age. This problem  has a tremendous resonance in every culture – in its literature, its values,  its objectives great and small. It also has an almost======================================================== defence was  that the senses cannot be deceptive in themselves. What misleads us  are only the false interpretations that we place on appearances. That  is indeed true – but only because our senses themselves do not say  anything. Only our interpretations of them do, and those are very  fallible. But the real key to science is that our explanatory theories –  which include those interpretations – can be  improved , through  conjecture, criticism and testing. Empiricism never did achieve its aim of liberating science from  authority. It denied the legitimacy of traditional authorities, and that  was salutary. But unfortunately it did this by setting up two other false  9 The Reach of Explanations authorities: sensory experience and whatever fictitious process of  ‘derivation’, such as induction, one imagines is used to extract theories  from experience.  The misconception that knowledge needs authority to be genuine  or reliable dates back to antiquity, and it still prevails. To this day,  most courses in the philosophy of knowledge teach that knowledge  is some form of  justified, true belief , where ‘justified’ means designated  as true (or at least ‘probable’) by reference to some authoritative source  or touchstone of knowledge. Thus ‘how do we  know  . . . ?’ is trans- formed into ‘by what authority do we claim . . . ?’ The latter question  is a chimera that may well have wasted more philosophers’ time and  effort than any other idea. It converts the quest for truth into a quest  for certainty (a feeling) or for endorsement (a social status). This  misconception is called  justificationism. The opposing position – namely the recognition that there are no  authoritative sources of knowledge, nor any reliable means of justifying  ideas as being true or probable – is called  fallibilism . To believers in  the justified-true-belief theory of knowledge, this recognition is the  occasion for despair or cynicism, because to them it means that know- ledge is unattainable. But to those of us for whom creating knowledge  means understanding better what is really there, and how it really  behaves and why, fallibilism is part of the very means by which this is  achieved. Fallibilists expect even their best and most fundamental  explanations to contain misconceptions in addition to truth, and so  they are predisposed to try to change them for the better. In contrast,  the logic of justificationism is to seek (and typically, to believe that one  has found) ways of securing ideas  against  change. Moreover, the logic  of fallibilism is that one not only seeks to correct the misconceptions  of the past, but hopes in the future to find and change mistaken ideas  that no one today questions or finds problematic. So it is fallibilism,  not mere rejection of authority, that is essential for the initiation of  unlimited knowledge growth – the beginning of infinity. The quest for authority led empiricists to downplay and even stig- matize  conjecture , the real source of all our theories. For if the senses  were the only source of knowledge, then error (or at least avoidable  error) could be caused only by adding to, subtracting from or mis  - interpreting what that source is saying. Thus empiricists came to believe  10 the beginning of infinity that, in addition to rejecting ancient authority and tradition, scientists  should suppress or ignore any  new  ideas they might have, except those  that had been properly ‘derived’ from experience. As Arthur Conan  Doyle’s fictional detective Sherlock Holmes put it in the short story    ‘A Scandal in Bohemia’, ‘It is a capital mistake to theorize before one    has data.’ But that was itself a capital mistake. We never know any data before  interpreting it through theories. All observations are, as Popper put it,  theory-laden ,* and hence fallible, as all our theories are. Consider the  nerve signals reaching our brains from our sense organs. Far from  providing direct or untainted access to reality, even they themselves  are never experienced for what they really are – namely crackles of  electrical activity. Nor, for the most part, do we experience them as  being  where  they really are – inside our brains. Instead, we place them  in the reality beyond. We do not just see blue: we see a blue sky up  there, far away. We do not just feel pain: we experience a headache,  or a stomach ache. The brain attaches those interpretations – ‘head’,  ‘stomach’ and ‘up there’ – to events that are in fact within the brain  itself. Our sense organs themselves, and all the interpretations that we  consciously and unconsciously attach to their outputs, are notoriously  fallible – as witness the celestial-sphere theory, as well as every optical  illusion and conjuring trick. So we perceive  nothing  as what it really  is. It is all theoretical interpretation: conjecture.  Conan Doyle came much closer to the truth when, during ‘The  Boscombe Valley Mystery’, he had Holmes remark that ‘circumstantial======================================================== directly. Perhaps the most creative individuals were able to gain status  more effectively though intrigue or other social manipulation. This  could have given them an evolutionary advantage without producing  any progress of which we would see evidence. However, all such  theories still face the problem of explaining why, if creativity was being  used intensively for any purpose, it was not  also  used for functional  402 the beginning of infinity purposes. Why would a chief who had gained power through creative  intrigue not be thinking about better spears for hunting? Why wouldn’t  a subordinate who invented such a thing have been favoured? Similarly,  wouldn’t potential mates who were impressed by artistic displays  also   have been impressed by practical innovations? In any case, some  practical innovations would themselves have helped the discoverers to  produce better displays. And innovations sometimes have reach: a new  skill of making a string of decorative beads in one generation might  become the skill of making a slingshot in the next. So why were  practical innovations originally so rare?  From the discussion in the previous chapter, one might guess that it  was because the tribes or families in which people were living were  static societies, in which any noticeable innovation would reduce one’s  status and hence presumably one’s eligibility to mate. So how does one  gain status, specifically by exercising more creativity than anyone else,  without becoming noticeable as a taboo-violator?  I think there is only one way: it is to enact that society’s memes more  faithfully than the norm. To display exceptional conformity and obedi- ence. To refrain exceptionally well from innovation. A static society  has no choice but to reward that sort of conspicuousness. So – can  enhanced creativity help one to be  less  innovative than other people?  That turns out to be a pivotal question, to which I shall return below.  But first I must address a second puzzle. How do you replicate a meaning? Meme replication is often characterized (for example by Blackmore)  as  imitation.  But that cannot be so. A meme is an idea, and we cannot  observe ideas inside other people’s brains. Nor do we have the hardware  to download them from one brain to another like computer programs,  nor to replicate them like DNA molecules. So we cannot literally copy  or imitate memes. The only access we have to their content is through  their holders’ behaviour (including their speech, and consequences of  their behaviour such as their writings).  Meme replication always follows this pattern: one observes the  holders’ behaviour, directly or indirectly. Then, later – sometimes  immediately, sometimes after years of such observation – memes from  403 The Evolution of Creativity the holders’ brains are present in one’s own brain. How do they get  there? It looks a bit like induction, does it not? But induction is  impossible. The process often seems to involve imitating the holders. For instance,  we learn words by imitating their sounds; we learn how to wave by  being waved to and imitating what we see. Thus, outwardly, and even  to our own introspection, we appear to be copying aspects of what  other people do, and remembering what they say and write. This  common-sense misconception is even corroborated by the fact that  our species’ closest living relatives, the great apes, also have a (much  more limited, but nevertheless striking) ability to imitate. But, as I shall  explain, the truth is that imitating people’s actions and remembering  their utterances could not possibly be the basis of human meme rep  - lication. In reality these play only a small – and for the most part  inessential – role. Meme acquisition comes so naturally to us that it is hard to see what  a miraculous process it is, or what is really happening. It is especially  hard to see where the  knowledge  is coming from. There is a great deal  of knowledge in even the simplest of human memes. When we learn  to wave, we learn not only the gesture but also which aspects of the  situation made it appropriate to wave, and how, and to whom. We are  not told most of this, yet we learn it anyway. Similarly, when we learn  a word, we also learn its meaning, including highly inexplicit subtleties.  How do we acquire that knowledge?  Not by imitating the holders. Popper used to begin his lecture course  on the philosophy of science by asking the students simply to ‘observe’.  Then he would wait in silence for one of them to ask  what  they were  supposed to observe. This was his way of demonstrating one of many  flaws in the empiricism that is still part of common sense today. So he  would explain to them that scientific observation is impossible without  pre-existing knowledge about what to look at, what to look for, how  to look, and how to interpret what one sees. And he would explain  that, therefore, theory has to come first. It has to be conjectured,    not derived.======================================================== physics were in fact different from what we  currently think they are, then so might be the set of mathematical truths  that we would then be able to prove, and so might the operations that  would be available to prove them with. The laws of physics as we  know them happen to afford a privileged status to such operations as  not ,  and  and  or , acting on individual bits of information (binary digits,  or logical true/false values). That is why those operations seem natural,  elementary and finite to us – and why bits do. If the laws of physics  were like, say, those of Infinity Hotel, then there would be additional  privileged operations, acting on infinite sets of bits. With some other  laws of physics, the operations  not ,  and  and  or  would be non-computable,  while some of our non-computable functions would seem natural,  elementary and finite. That brings me to another distinction that depends on the laws of  physics:  simple  versus  complex . Brains are physical objects. Thoughts  are computations, of the types permitted under the laws of physics.  Some explanations can be grasped easily and quickly – like ‘If Socrates  was a man and Plato was a man then they were both men.’ This is easy  because it can be stated in a short sentence and relies on the properties  187 A Window on Infinity of an elementary operation (namely  and ). Other explanations are  inherently hard to grasp, because their shortest form is still long    and depends on many such operations. But whether the form of an  ex    planation is long or short, and whether it requires few or many  elementary operations, depends entirely on the laws of physics under  which it is being stated and understood. Quantum  computation, which is currently believed to be the fully  universal form of computation, happens to have exactly the same    set of computable functions as Turing’s classical computation. But  quantum computation drives a coach and horses through the classical  notion of a ‘simple’ or ‘elementary’ operation. It makes some intuitively  very complex things simple. Moreover, the elementary information- storing entity in quantum computation, the ‘qubit’ (quantum bit) is  quite hard to explain in non-quantum terminology. Meanwhile the  bit  is a fairly complicated object from the perspective of quantum  physics. Some people object that quantum computation therefore isn’t ‘real’  computation: it is just physics, just engineering. To them, those logical  possibilities about exotic laws of physics enabling exotic forms of  computation do not address the issue of what a proof ‘really’ is. Their  objection would go something like this: admittedly, under suitable laws  of physics we would be able to compute non-Turing-computable  functions, but that would not be  computation . We would be able to  establish the truth or falsity of Turing-undecidable propositions, but  that ‘establishing’ would not be  proving , because then our knowledge  of whether the proposition was true or false would for ever depend on  our knowledge of what the laws of physics are. If we discovered one  day that the real laws of physics were different, we might have to  change our minds about the proof too, and its conclusion. And so it  would not be a real proof: real proof is independent of physics. Here is that same misconception again (as well as some authority- seeking justificationism). Our  knowledge  of whether a proposition is  true or false  always  depends on knowledge about how physical objects  behave. If we changed our minds about what a computer, or a brain,  has been doing – for instance, if we decided that our own memory  was faulty about which steps we had checked in a proof – then we  would be forced to change our opinion about whether we had proved  188 the beginning of infinity some  thing or not. It would be no different if we changed our minds  about what the laws of physics made the computer do. Whether a mathematical proposition is true or not is indeed inde- pend  ent of physics. But the  proof  of such a proposition is a matter  of physics only. There is no such thing as abstractly proving some-  thing, just as there is no such thing as abstractly knowing something.  Mathematical truth is absolutely necessary and transcendent, but    all knowledge is generated by physical processes, and its scope and  limitations are conditioned by the laws of nature. One can define a  class of abstract entities and call them ‘proofs’ (or computations), just  as one can define abstract entities and call them triangles and have  them obey Euclidean geometry. But you cannot infer anything from  that theory of ‘triangles’ about what angle you will turn through if you  walk around a closed path consisting of three straight lines. Nor can  those ‘proofs’ do the job of verifying mathematical statements. A  mathematical ‘theory of proofs’ has no bearing on which truths can  or cannot be proved in reality, or be known in reality; and similarly a  theory of======================================================== why that must be so, starting with the fallibility  of the human mind and the unreliability of sensory experience.  plato : [ Scribbles,   ‘It’s only knowledge  of the material world  that’s  impossible, useless and undesirable.’ ] socrates: He  gave me a marvellous perspective on how we perceive  the world. Each of your eyes is like a dark little cave, one on whose  rear wall some stray shadows fall from outside. You spend your  whole life at the back of that cave, able to see nothing but that rear  wall, so you cannot see reality directly at all.  plato : [ Scribbles,   ‘It is as if we were prisoners, chained inside a cave  and permitted to look only at the rear wall. We can never know the  253 A Dream of Socrates reality outside because we see only fleeting, distorted shadows of it.’ ] [Note: Socrates is slightly improving on Hermes, and Plato has  been increasingly misinterpreting Socrates.] socrates: He  then went on to explain to me that objective knowledge  is indeed possible: it comes from within! It begins as conjecture, and  is then  corrected  by repeated cycles of criticism, including comparison  with the evidence on our ‘wall’.  plato : [ Scribbles,   ‘The only true knowledge is that which comes from  within. (How? Remembered from a previous life?)’ ] socrates: In  this way, we frail and fallible humans can come to know  objective reality – provided we use philosophically sound methods  as I have described (which most people do not). plato : [ Scribbles,   ‘We can come to know the true world beyond the  illusory world of experience. But only by pursuing the kingly art of  philosophy.’ ] chaerephon:  Socrates, I think it  was  the god speaking to you, for I  strongly feel that I have glimpsed a divine truth through you today.  It will take me a long time to reorganize my ideas to take account  of this new epistemology that he revealed to you. It seems a  tremendously far-reaching, and important, subject. socrates:  Indeed. I have some reorganizing to do myself. plato : Socrates, you really ought to write all this down – together  with all your other wisdom – for the benefit of the whole world, and  posterity. socrates: No  need, Aristocles. Posterity is right here, listening.  Posterity is all of  you , my friends. What is the point of writing down  things that are going to be endlessly tinkered with and improved?  Rather than make a permanent record of all my misconceptions as  they are at a particular instant, I would rather offer them to others  in two-way debate. That way I benefit from criticism and may even  make improvements myself. Whatever is valuable will survive such  debates and be passed on without any effort from me. Whatever is  not valuable would only make me look a fool to future generations. plato : If you say so, Master. Since Socrates left us no writings, historians of ideas can only guess at  what he really thought and taught, using the indirect evidence of his  254 the beginning of infinity portrayal by Plato and a few others who were there at the time and  whose accounts have survived. This is known as the ‘Socratic problem’,  and is the source of much controversy. One common view is that the  young Plato conveyed Socrates’ philosophy fairly faithfully, but that  later he used the character of Socrates more as a vehicle for conveying  his own views; that he did not even intend his dialogues to represent  the real Socrates, but used them only as convenient ways of expressing  arguments that have a to-and-fro form.  Perhaps I had better stress – in case it is not already obvious – that  I am doing the same. I do not intend the above dialogue accurately to  represent the philosophical opinions of the historical Socrates and  Plato. I have set it at that moment in history, with those participants,  because Socrates and his circle were among the foremost contributors  to the ‘Golden Age of Athens’, which should have become a beginning  of infinity but did not. And also because one thing that we do know  about the ancient Greeks is that the philosophical  problems  they  considered important have dominated Western philosophy ever since:  How is knowledge obtained? How can we distinguish between true  and false, right and wrong, reason and unreason? Which sorts of  knowledge (moral, empirical, theological, mathematical, justified . . . )  are possible, and which are mere chimeras? And so on. And therefore,  although the theory of knowledge presented in the dialogue is largely  that of the twentieth-century philosopher Karl Popper, together with  some addenda of my own, I guess that Socrates would have understood  and liked it. In some universes that were very like ours at the time, he  thought of it himself. I do want to make one indirect comment on the Socratic problem,  though: we habitually underestimate the difficulty of communication  – just as Socrates does at the end of the dialogue, when he assumes  that each party to a debate necessarily knows what the other is saying,======================================================== which it would occur, had been  accurately predicted – but not from the assumption that the future  would be like the past. Even sunrise – that favourite example of  inductivists – is not always observed every twenty-four hours: when  viewed from orbit it may happen every ninety minutes, or not at all.  And that was known from theory long before anyone had ever orbited  the Earth. It is no defence of inductivism to point out that in all those cases  the future still does ‘resemble the past’ in the sense that it obeys the  7 The Reach of Explanations same underlying laws of nature. For that is an empty statement:  any   purported law of nature – true or false – about the future and the past  is a claim that they ‘resemble’ each other by both conforming to that  law. So that version of the ‘principle of induction’ could not be used  to derive any theory or prediction from experience or anything else. Even in everyday life we are well aware that the future is unlike the  past, and are selective about which aspects of our experience we expect  to be repeated. Before the year 2000, I had experienced thousands of  times that if a calendar was properly maintained (and used the standard  Gregorian system), then it displayed a year number beginning with  ‘19’. Yet at midnight on 31 December 1999 I expected to have the  experience of seeing a ‘20’ on every such calendar. I also expected that  there would be a gap of 17,000 years before anyone experienced a ‘19’  under those conditions again. Neither I nor anyone else had ever  observed such a ‘20’, nor such a gap, but our explanatory theories told  us to expect them, and expect them we did.  As the ancient philosopher Heraclitus remarked, ‘No man ever steps  in the same river twice, for it is not the same river and he is not the  same man.’ So, when we remember seeing sunrise ‘repeatedly’ under  ‘the same’ circumstances, we are tacitly relying on explanatory theories  to tell us which combinations of variables in our experience we should  interpret as being ‘repeated’ phenomena in the underlying reality, and  which are local or irrelevant. For instance, theories about geometry  and optics tell us not to expect to see a sunrise on a cloudy day, even  if a sunrise is really happening in the unobserved world behind the  clouds. Only from those explanatory theories do we know that failing  to see the sun on such days does not amount to an experience of its  not rising. Similarly, theory tells us that if we see sunrise reflected in a  mirror, or in a video or a virtual-reality game, that does not count as  seeing it twice. Thus the very idea that an experience has been repeated  is not itself a sensory experience, but a theory. So much for inductivism. And since inductivism is false, empiricism  must be as well. For if one cannot derive predictions from experience,  one certainly cannot derive explanations. Discovering a new explanation  is inherently an act of creativity. To interpret dots in the sky as white- hot, million-kilometre spheres, one must first have thought of the idea  of such spheres. And then one must explain why they look small and  8 the beginning of infinity cold and seem to move in lockstep around us and do not fall down.  Such ideas do not create themselves, nor can they be mechanically  derived from anything: they have to be guessed – after which they can  be criticized and tested. To the extent that experiencing dots ‘writes’  something into our brains, it does not write explanations but only dots.  Nor is nature a book: one could try to ‘read’ the dots in the sky for a  lifetime – many lifetimes – without learning anything about what they  really are.  Historically, that is exactly what happened. For millennia, most  careful observers of the sky believed that the stars were lights embedded  in a hollow, rotating ‘celestial sphere’ centred on the Earth (or that  they were holes in the sphere, through which the light of heaven shone).  This  geocentric  – Earth-centred – theory of the universe seemed to  have been directly derived from experience, and repeatedly confirmed:  anyone who looked up could ‘directly observe’ the celestial sphere,  and the stars maintaining their relative positions on it and being    held up just as the theory predicts. Yet in reality, the solar system is  heliocentric  – centred on the sun, not the Earth – and the Earth is not  at rest but in complex motion. Although we first noticed a daily rotation  by observing stars, it is not a property of the stars at all, but of the  Earth, and of the observers who rotate with it. It is a classic example  of the deceptiveness of the senses: the Earth looks and feels as though  it is at rest beneath our feet, even though it is really rotating. As for  the celestial sphere, despite being visible in broad daylight (as the sky),  it does not exist at all. The deceptiveness of the senses was always a problem for empiricism  – and thereby, it seemed, for science. The empiricists’ best======================================================== on, a rational agent in those universes will always get  consistent results when reasoning about probabilities – and about how  rare or common, typical or untypical, sparse or dense, fine-tuned or  not anything is. And so  now  the anthropic principle can make testable,  probabilistic predictions. What has made this possible is that the infinite set of universes with  different values of  D  is no longer merely a set. It is a single physical  entity, a multiverse with internal interactions (as harnessed by Lyra’s  device) that relate different parts of it to each other and thereby provide  a unique meaning, known as a  measure , to proportions and averages  over different universes. None of the anthropic-reasoning theories that have been proposed  to solve the fine-tuning problem provides any such measure. Most are  hardly more than speculations of the form ‘What if there were universes  with different physical constants?’ There is, however, one theory in  physics that already describes a multiverse for independent reasons.  All its universes have the same constants of physics, and the interactions  of these universes do not involve travel to, or measurement of, each  other. But it does provide a measure for universes. That theory is  quantum theory, which I shall discuss in Chapter 11.  * 181 A Window on Infinity The definition of infinity in terms of a one-to-one correspondence  between a set and part of itself was original to Cantor. It is connected  only indirectly to the informal, intuitive way that non-mathematicians  have conceived of infinity both before and since – namely that ‘infinite’  means something like ‘bigger than any finite combination of finite  things’. But that informal notion is rather circular unless we have some  independent idea of what makes something  finite , and what makes  a single act of ‘combination’ finite. The intuitive answer would be  anthropocentric: something is definitely finite if it could in principle  be encompassed by a human experience. But what does it mean to  ‘experience’ something? Was Cantor experiencing infinity when he  proved theorems about it? Or was he experiencing only symbols? But  we only  ever  experience symbols.  One can avoid this anthropocentrism by referring instead to measur- ing instruments: a quantity is definitely neither infinite nor infinitesimal  if it could, in principle, register on some measuring instrument. How-  ever, by that definition a quantity can be finite even if the underlying  explanation refers to an infinite set in the mathematical sense. To  display the result of a measurement the needle on a meter might move  by one centimetre, which is a finite distance, but it consists of an  uncountable infinity of points. This can happen because, although  points  appear in lowest-level explanations of what is happening, the  number of points  never appears in predictions. Physics deals in distances,  not numbers of points. Similarly, Newton and Leibniz were able to use  infinitesimal distances to explain physical quantities like instantaneous  velocity, yet there is nothing physically infinitesimal or infinite in, say,  the continuous motion of a projectile. To the management of Infinity Hotel, issuing a finite public-address  announcement is a finite operation, even though it causes a trans- formation involving an infinite number of events in the hotel. On  the other hand,  most  logically possible transformations could be  achieved only with an infinite number of such announcements –  which the laws of physics in their world do not allow. Remember,  no one in Infinity Hotel – neither staff nor guest – ever performs  more than a finite number of actions. Similarly in the Lyra multiverse,  a measuring instrument can take the average of an infinite number  of values during a finite, two-minute expedition. So that is a physically  182 the beginning of infinity finite  operation in that world. But taking the ‘average’ of the same  infinite set in a different order would require an infinite number of  such trips, which, again, would not be possible under those laws of  physics. Only the laws of physics determine what is finite in nature. Failure  to realize this has often caused confusion. The paradoxes of Zeno of  Elea, such as that of Achilles and the tortoise, were early examples. Zeno managed to conclude that, in a race against a tortoise, Achilles  will never overtake the tortoise if it has a head start – because, by the  time Achilles reaches the point where the tortoise began, the tortoise  will have moved on a little. By the time he reaches that new point, it  will have moved a little further, and so on ad infinitum. Thus the  ‘catching-up’ procedure requires Achilles to perform an infinite number  of catching-up steps in a finite time, which as a finite being he  presumably  cannot do. Do you see what Zeno did there? He just  presumed  that the math- ematical notion that happens to be called ‘infinity’ faithfully captures  the======================================================== alleviation – and thus between stagnation and progress in the  fullest sense. In this book I argue that all progress, both theoretical and practical,  has resulted from a single human activity: the quest for what I call  good explanations. Though this quest is uniquely human, its effective- ness is also a fundamental fact about reality at the most impersonal,  cosmic level – namely that it conforms to universal laws of nature that  are indeed good explanations. This simple relationship between the  cosmic and the human is a hint of a central role of  people  in the cosmic  scheme of things. Must progress come to an end – either in catastrophe or in some  sort of completion – or is it unbounded? The answer is the latter. That  unboundedness is the ‘infinity’ referred to in the title of this book.  Explaining it, and the conditions under which progress can and cannot  happen, entails a journey through virtually every fundamental field of  science and philosophy. From each such field we learn that, although  progress has no necessary end, it does have a necessary beginning: a  cause, or an event with which it starts, or a necessary condition for it  to take off and to thrive. Each of these beginnings is ‘the beginning of  infinity’ as viewed from the perspective of that field. Many seem,  superficially, to be unconnected. But they are all facets of a single  attribute of reality, which I call  the  beginning of infinity. introduction 1 1 The Reach of Explanations Behind it all is surely an idea so simple, so beautiful, that when  we grasp it – in a decade, a century, or a millennium – we will  all say to each other, how could it have been otherwise? John Archibald Wheeler,  Annals of the  New York Academy of Sciences , 480 (1986) To unaided human eyes, the universe beyond our solar system looks  like a few thousand glowing dots in the night sky, plus the faint, hazy  streaks of the Milky Way. But if you ask an astronomer what is out  there in reality, you will be told not about dots or streaks, but about  stars : spheres of incandescent gas millions of kilometres in diameter  and light years away from us. You will be told that the sun is a typical  star, and looks different from the others only because we are much  closer to it – though still some 150 million kilometres away. Yet, even  at those unimaginable distances, we are confident that we know what  makes stars shine: you will be told that they are powered by the nuclear  energy released by  transmutation  – the conversion of one chemical  element into another (mainly hydrogen into helium).  Some types of transmutation happen spontaneously on Earth, in the  decay of radioactive elements. This was first demonstrated in 1901, by  the physicists Frederick Soddy and Ernest Rutherford, but the concept  of transmutation was ancient. Alchemists had dreamed for centuries  of transmuting ‘base metals’, such as iron or lead, into gold. They never  came close to understanding what it would take to achieve that, so  they never did so. But scientists in the twentieth century did. And so  do stars, when they explode as supernovae. Base metals can be  2 the beginning of infinity transmuted into gold by stars, and by intelligent beings who understand  the processes that power stars, but by nothing else in the universe. As for the Milky Way, you will be told that, despite its insubstantial  appearance, it is the most massive object that we can see with the naked  eye: a  galaxy  that includes stars by the hundreds of billions, bound by  their mutual gravitation across tens of thousands of light years. We  are seeing it from the inside, because we are part of it. You will be told  that, although our night sky appears serene and largely changeless, the  universe is seething with violent activity. Even a typical star converts  millions of tonnes of mass into energy every second, with each  gram   releasing as much energy as an atom bomb. You will be told that within  the range of our best telescopes, which can see more galaxies than  there are stars in our galaxy, there are several supernova explosions  per second, each briefly brighter than all the other stars in its galaxy  put together. We do not know where life and intelligence exist, if at  all, outside our solar system, so we do not know how many of those  explosions are horrendous tragedies. But we do know that a supernova  devastates all the planets that may be orbiting it, wiping out all life  that may exist there – including any intelligent beings, unless they have  technology far superior to ours. Its neutrino radiation alone would kill  a human at a range of billions of kilometres, even if that entire distance  were filled with lead shielding. Yet we owe our existence to supernovae:  they are the source, through transmutation, of most of the elements  of which our bodies, and our planet, are composed.  There are phenomena that outshine supernovae. In March 2008 an  X-ray telescope in Earth orbit detected an======================================================== be much truer to say that the landscape  we live in is the  product  of ideas. The primeval landscape, though  packed with evidence and therefore opportunity, contained not a single  idea. It is knowledge alone that converts landscapes into resources,  and humans alone who are the authors of explanatory knowledge and  hence of the uniquely human behaviour called ‘history’.  Physical resources such as plants, animals and minerals afford  opportunities, which may inspire new ideas, but they can neither create  ideas nor cause people to have particular ideas. They also cause  problems, but they do not prevent people from finding ways to solve  those problems. Some overwhelming natural event like a volcanic  eruption might have wiped out an ancient civilization regardless of  what the victims were thinking, but that sort of thing is exceptional.  Usually, if there are human beings left alive to think, there are ways of  thinking that can improve their situation, and then improve it further.  Unfortunately, as I have explained, there are also ways of thinking that  can prevent all improvement. Thus, since the beginning of civilization  and before, both the principal opportunities for progress and the  principal obstacles to progress have consisted of ideas alone. These    are the determinants of the broad sweep of history. The primeval  distribution of horses or llamas or flint or uranium can affect only the  details, and then only  after  some human being has had an idea for how  to use those things. The effects of ideas and decisions almost entirely  determine which biogeographical factors have a bearing on the next  chapter of human history, and what that effect will be. Marx, Engels  and Diamond have it the wrong way round. A thousand years is a long time for a static society to survive. We  430 the beginning of infinity think of the great centralized empires of antiquity which lasted even  longer; but that is a selection effect: we have no record of most static  societies, and they must have been much shorter-lived. A natural guess  is that most were destroyed by the first challenge that would have  required the creation of a significantly new pattern of behaviour. The  isolated location of Easter Island, and the relatively hospitable nature  of its environment, might have given its static society a longer lifespan  than it would have had if it had been exposed to more tests by nature  and by other societies. But even those factors are still largely human,  not biogeographical: if the islanders had known how to make long-range  ocean voyages, the island would not have been ‘isolated’ in the relevant  sense. Likewise, how ‘hospitable’ Easter Island is depends on what the  inhabitants know. If its settlers had known as little about survival  techniques as I do, then they would not have survived their first week  on the island. And, on the other hand, today thousands of people live  on Easter Island without starving and without a forest – though now  they are planting one because they want to and know how. The Easter Island civilization collapsed because no human situation  is free of new problems, and static societies are inherently unstable in  the face of new problems. Civilizations rose and collapsed on other  South Pacific islands too – including Pitcairn Island. That was part of  the broad sweep of history in the region. And, in the big picture, the  cause was that they all had problems that they failed to solve. The  Easter Islanders failed to navigate their way off the island, just as the  Romans failed to solve the problem of how to change governments  peacefully. If there was a forestry disaster on Easter Island, that was  not what brought its inhabitants down: it was that they were chronically  unable to solve the problem that this raised. If that problem had not  dispatched their civilization, some other problem eventually would  have. Sustaining their civilization in its static, statue-obsessed state was  never an option. The only options were whether it would collapse  suddenly and painfully, destroying most of what little knowledge they  had, or change slowly and for the better. Perhaps they would have  chosen the latter if only they had known how. We do not know what horrors the Easter Island civilization per  - petrated in the course of preventing progress. But apparently its fall  did not improve anything. Indeed, the fall of tyranny is never enough.  431 Unsustainable The sustained creation of knowledge depends also on the presence    of certain kinds of idea, particularly optimism, and an associated  tradition of criticism. There would have to be social and political  institutions that incorporated and protected such traditions: a society  in which some degree of dissent and deviation from the norm was  tolerated, and whose educational practices did not entirely extinguish  creativity. None of that is trivially achieved. Western civilization is the  current conse  quence of achieving it –======================================================== evidence’ (evidence about unwitnessed events) is ‘a very tricky thing  . . . It may seem to point very straight to one thing, but if you shift  your own point of view a little, you may find it pointing in an equally  uncompromising manner to something entirely different . . . There is  nothing more deceptive than an obvious fact.’ The same holds for  scientific discovery. And that again raises the question: how do we  know? If all our theories originate locally, as guesswork in our own  minds, and can be tested only locally, by experience, how is it that they  contain such extensive and accurate knowledge about the reality that  we have never experienced?  *The term was coined by the philosopher Norwood Russell Hanson. 11 The Reach of Explanations I am not asking what authority scientific knowledge is derived from,  or rests on. I mean, literally, by what process do ever truer and more  detailed explanations about the world come to be represented physically  in our brains? How do we come to know about the interactions of  subatomic particles during transmutation at the centre of a distant star,  when even the tiny trickle of light that reaches our instruments from  the star was emitted by glowing gas at the star’s surface, a million  kilometres above where the transmutation is happening? Or about  conditions in the fireball during the first few seconds after the Big Bang,  which would instantly have destroyed any sentient being or scientific  instrument? Or about the future, which we have no way of measuring  at all? How is it that we can predict, with some non-negligible degree  of confidence, whether a new design of microchip will work, or whether  a new drug will cure a particular disease, even though they have never  existed before? For most of human history, we did not know how to do any of this.  People were not designing microchips or medications or even the wheel.  For thousands of generations, our ancestors looked up at the night sky  and wondered what stars are – what they are made of, what makes  them shine, what their relationship is with each other and with us –  which was exactly the right thing to wonder about. And they were  using eyes and brains anatomically indistinguishable from those of  modern astronomers. But they discovered nothing about it. Much the  same was true in every other field of knowledge. It was not for lack of  trying, nor for lack of thinking. People observed the world. They    tried to understand it – but almost entirely in vain. Occasionally they  recognized simple patterns in the appearances. But when they tried to  find out what was really there behind those appearances, they failed  almost completely.  I expect that, like today, most people wondered about such things  only occasionally – during breaks from addressing their more parochial  concerns. But their parochial concerns  also  involved yearning to  know – and not only out of pure curiosity. They wished they knew  how to safeguard their food supply; how they could rest when tired  without risking starvation; how they could be warmer, cooler, safer, in  less pain – in every aspect of their lives, they wished they knew how  to make progress. But, on the timescale of individual lifetimes, they  12 the beginning of infinity almost never made any. Discoveries such as fire, clothing, stone    tools, bronze, and so on, happened so rarely that from an individual’s  point of view the world never improved. Sometimes people even  realized (with somewhat miraculous prescience) that making progress  in practical ways would  depend  on progress in understanding puzzling  phenomena in the sky. They even conjectured links between the two,  such as myths, which they found compelling enough to dominate their  lives – yet which still bore no resemblance to the truth. In short, they  wanted to create knowledge, in order to make progress, but they did  not know how.  This was the situation from our species’ earliest prehistory, through  the dawn of civilization, and through its imperceptibly slow increase  in sophistication – with many reverses – until a few centuries ago. Then  a powerful new mode of discovery and explanation emerged, which  later became known as  science . Its emergence is known as the  scientific  revolution , because it succeeded almost immediately in creating know- ledge at a noticeable rate, which has increased ever since.  What had changed? What made science effective at understanding  the physical world when all previous ways had failed? What were  people now doing, for the first time, that made the difference? This  question began to be asked as soon as science began to be successful,  and there have been many conflicting answers, some containing truth.  But none, in my view, has reached the heart of the matter. To explain  my own answer, I have to give a little context first. The scientific revolution was part of a wider intellectual revolution,  the  Enlightenment , which also brought progress in other======================================================== Attenborough regards the culture as  having been very valuable and its fall as a tragedy. Bronowski’s view was  closer to mine, which is that since the culture never improved, its  survival  for many centuries was a tragedy, like that of all static societies. Attenborough is not alone in drawing frightening lessons from the  history of Easter Island. It has become a widely adduced version of    the Spaceship Earth metaphor. But what exactly is the analogy behind  the lesson? The idea that civilization depends on good  forest  manage- ment has little reach. But the broader interpretation, that survival  depends on good  resource  management, has almost no content:  any   physical object can be deemed a ‘resource’. And, since problems are  soluble, all disasters are caused by ‘poor resource management’. The  ancient Roman ruler Julius Caesar was stabbed to death, so one could  sum    marize his mistake as ‘imprudent iron management, resulting in  an excessive build-up of iron in his body’. It is true that if he had  succeeded in keeping iron away from his body he would not have died  in the (exact) way he did, yet, as an explanation of how and why he  died, that ludicrously misses the point. The interesting question is not  what he was stabbed with, but how it came about that other politicians  plotted to remove him violently from office and that they succeeded.  A Popperian analysis would focus on the fact that Caesar had taken  vigorous steps to ensure that he could not be removed  without  violence.  And then on the fact that his removal did not rectify, but actually  entrenched, this progress-suppressing innovation. To under  stand such  events and their wider significance, one has to understand the politics  of the situation, the psychology, the philosophy, sometimes the theology.  Not the cutlery. The Easter Islanders may or may not have suffered a  forest-management fiasco. But, if they did, the ex      planation would not  be about why they made mistakes – problems are inevitable – but why  they failed to correct them. I have argued that the laws of nature cannot possibly impose any  bound on progress: by the argument of Chapters 1 and 3, denying this  is tantamount to invoking the supernatural. In other words, progress  is  sustainable , indefinitely. But only by people who engage in a particular  kind of thinking and behaviour – the problem-solving and problem- creating kind characteristic of the Enlightenment. And that requires  the optimism of a dynamic society. 424 the beginning of infinity One of the consequences of optimism is that one expects to learn  from failure – one’s own and others’. But the idea that our civilization  has something to learn from the Easter Islanders’ alleged forestry failure  is not derived from any structural resemblance between our situation  and theirs. For they failed to make progress in practically every area.  No one expects the Easter Islanders’ failures in, say, medicine to explain  our difficulties in curing cancer, or their failure to understand the night  sky to explain why a quantum theory of gravity is elusive to us. The  Easter Islanders’ errors, both methodological and substantive, were  simply too elementary to be relevant to us, and their imprudent forestry,  if that is really what destroyed their civilization, would merely be typical  of their lack of problem-solving ability across the board. We should  do much better to study their many small successes than their entirely  commonplace failures. If we could discover their rules of thumb (such  as ‘stone mulching’ to help grow crops on poor soil), we might find  valuable fragments of historical and ethnological knowledge, or    perhaps even something of practical use. But one cannot draw general  conclusions from rules of thumb. It would be astonishing if the details  of a primitive, static society’s collapse had any relevance to hidden  dangers that may be facing our open, dynamic and scientific society,  let alone what we should do about them.  The knowledge that would have saved the Easter Islanders’ civil- ization has already been in our possession for centuries. A sextant would  have allowed them to explore their ocean and bring back the seeds of  new forests and of new ideas. Greater wealth, and a written culture,  would have enabled them to recover after a devastating plague. But,  most of all, they would have been better at solving problems of all kinds  if they had known some of our ideas about how to do that, such as the  rudi  ments of a scientific outlook. Such knowledge would not have  guaranteed their welfare, any more than it guarantees ours. Nevertheless,  the fact that their civilization failed for lack of what ours discovered  long ago cannot be an ominous ‘warning of what the future could hold’  for us. This knowledge-based approach to explaining human events follows  from the general arguments of this book. We know that achieving  arbitrary physical transformations that are not======================================================== copy  of the older book to every millionth room, and a copy of the newer  book to each remaining room. Suppose that you are a guest at the hotel. A book – gift-wrapped in  opaque paper – appears in your room’s delivery chute. You are hoping  that it will be the newer book, because you have already read the old  one. You are fairly confident that it  will  be, because, after all, what are  the chances that your room is one of those that receive the old book?  Exactly one in a million, it seems. But, before you have a chance to open the package, there is an  announcement. Everyone is to change rooms, to a number designated  on a card that will come through the chute. The announcement also  mentions that the new allocation will move all the recipients of one of  the books to odd-numbered rooms, and the recipients of the other  book to even-numbered ones, but it does not say which is which. So  you cannot tell, from your new room number, which book you have  received. Of course there is no problem with filling the rooms in this  manner: both books had infinitely many recipients. 1   2   4   3   6   8   5   10   12   7   14   16   … 177 A Window on Infinity Your card arrives and you move to your new room. Are you    now any less sure about which of the two books you have received?  Presumably not. By your previous reasoning, there is now only a one  in  two  chance that your book is  The Beginning of Infinity , because it  is now in ‘half the rooms’. Since that is a contradiction, your method  of assessing those probabilities must have been wrong. Indeed, all  methods of assessing them are wrong, because – as this example shows  – in Infinity Hotel there is  no such thing  as the probability that you  have received the one book or the other. Mathematically, this is nothing momentous. The example merely  demonstrates again that the attributes probable or improbable, rare  or common, typical or untypical have literally no meaning in regard  to comparing infinite sets of natural numbers.  But, when we turn to physics, it is bad news for anthropic arguments.  Imagine an infinite set of  universes , all with the same laws of physics  except that one particular physical constant, let us call it  D , has a  different value in each. (Strictly speaking, we should imagine an  un    - countable  infinity of universes, like those infinitely thin cards – but that  only makes the problem I am about to describe worse, so let us keep  things simple.) Assume that, of these universes, infinitely many have  values of  D  that produce astrophysicists, and infinitely many have  values that do not. Then let us number the universes in such a way that  all those with astrophysicists have even numbers and all the ones  without astrophysicists have odd numbers.  This does not mean that half the universes have astrophysicists. Just  as with the book distribution in Infinity Hotel, we could equally well  label the universes so that only every third universe, or every trillionth  one, had astrophysicists, or so that every trillionth one did not. So there  is something wrong with the anthropic explanation of the fine-tuning  problem: we can make the fine-tuning go away just by relabelling the  universes. At our whim, we can number them in such a way that  astrophysicists seem to be the rule, or the exception, or anything in  between.  Now, suppose that we calculate, using the relevant laws of physics  with different values of  D , whether astrophysicists will emerge. We  find that for values of  D  outside the range from, say, 137 to 138, those  that contain astrophysicists are very sparse: only one in a trillion such  178 the beginning of infinity universes has astrophysicists. Within the range, only one in a trillion  does  not  have astrophysicists, and for values of  D  between 137.4  and 137.6 they all do.  Let me stress that in real life we do not  understand the process of astrophysicist-formation remotely well  enough to calculate such numbers – and perhaps we never shall, as I  shall explain in the next chapter. But, whether we could calculate them  or not, anthropic theorists would wish to interpret such numbers as  meaning that, if we measure  D , we are  unlikely  to see values outside  the range from 137 to 138. But they mean no such thing. For we could  just relabel the universes (shuffle the infinite pack of ‘cards’) to make  the spacings exactly the other way round – or anything else we liked.  Scientific explanations cannot possibly depend on how we choose  to label the entities referred to in the theory. So anthropic reasoning,  by itself, cannot make predictions. Which is why I said in Chapter 4  that it cannot explain the fine-tuning of the constants of physics.  The physicist Lee Smolin has proposed an ingenious variant of the  anthropic explanation. It relies on the fact that, according to some  theories of quantum gravity, it is possible for a black hole to spawn  an entire new universe inside itself. Smolin supposes======================================================== if they were slightly altered they would  serve it less well, or not at all. A good design is  hard to vary : If the different parts had been differently shaped from what they are, of  a different size from what they are, or placed after any other manner, or  in any other order, than that in which they are placed, either no motion  at all would have been carried on in the machine, or none which would  have answered the use that is now served by it. 86 the beginning of infinity Merely being useful for a purpose, without being hard to vary while  still serving that purpose, is not a sign of adaptation or design. For  instance, one can also use the sun to keep time, but all its features  would serve that purpose equally well if slightly (or even massively)  altered. Just as we transform many of the Earth’s non-adapted raw  materials to meet our purposes, so we also find uses for the sun that  it was never designed or adapted to provide. The knowledge, in that  case, is entirely in us – and in our sundials – not in the sun. But it  is  embodied in the watch, and in the mouse. So, how did all that knowledge come to be embodied in those things?  As I said, Paley could conceive of only one explanation. That was his  first mistake: The inference we think is inevitable, that the watch must have had a   maker . . . There cannot be design without a designer; contrivance without  a contriver; order without choice; arrangement without anything capable  of arranging; subserviency and relation to a purpose without that which  could intend a purpose; means suitable to an end . . . without the end ever  having been contemplated or the means accommodated to it. Arrangement,  disposition of parts, subserviency of means to an end, relation of instru- ments to a use imply the presence of intelligence and mind. We now know that there  can  be ‘design without a designer’: know  ledge  without a person who created it. Some types of knowledge can be  created by evolution. I shall come to that shortly. But it is no criticism  of Paley that he was unaware of a discovery that had yet to be made  – one of the greatest discoveries in the history of science.  However, although Paley was spot on in his understanding of the  problem , he somehow did not realize that his proposed solution,  creationism, does not solve it, and is even ruled out by his own argu- ment. For the ultimate designer for whose existence Paley was arguing  would also be a purposeful and complex entity – certainly no less so  than a watch or a living organism. Hence, as many critics have since  noticed, if we substitute ‘ultimate designer’ for ‘watch’ in Paley’s text  above, we force Paley to ‘the [inevitable] inference . . . that the ultimate  designer must have had a maker’. Since that is a contradiction, the  argument from design as perfected by Paley rules out the existence of  an ultimate designer. 87 Creation Note that this is not a disproof of the existence of God, any more  than the original argument was a proof. But it does show that, in any  good explanation of the origin of biological adaptations, God cannot  play the role assigned by creationism. Though this is the opposite of  what Paley believed he had achieved, none of us can choose what our  ideas imply. His argument has universal reach for anything that has,  by his criterion, the appearance of design. As an elucidation of the  special status of living things, and in setting a benchmark that ex    - planations of knowledge-laden entities must meet if they are to make  sense, it is essential to understanding the world. Lamarckism Before Darwin’s theory of evolution, people had already been wonder- ing whether the biosphere and its adaptations might have come into  existence gradually. Darwin’s grandfather Erasmus Darwin (1731– 1802), a stalwart of the Enlightenment, was among them. They called  that process ‘evolution’, but the meaning of the word then was different  from its primary one today.  All  processes of gradual improvement,  regardless of their mechan  ism, were known as ‘evolution’. (That  terminology survives to this day in casual usage and as a technical term  in, of all places, theoretical physics, where ‘evolution’ means any sort  of continuous change that one is explaining through laws of physics.)  Charles Darwin distinguished the process that he discovered by calling  it ‘evolution by natural selection’ – though a better name would have  been ‘evolution by variation and selection’. As Paley might well have recognized if he had lived to hear of it,  ‘evolution by natural selection’ is a much more substantive mode of  explanation than mere ‘evolution’. For the latter does not solve his  problem, while the former does.  Any  theory about improvement raises  the question: how is the knowledge of how to make that improvement  created? Was it already present at the outset? The theory that it was is  creationism. Did it ‘just happen’? The theory that it did is spontaneous  generation.

But there is    no rational basis for that reputation. It is absurdly parochial to read  some deep significance into this particular failure, among so many,    of the biosphere to support human life – or of medical science through-  out the ages to cure ageing. The problem of ageing is of the same    general type as that of disease. Although it is a complex problem by  present-day standards, the complexity is finite and confined to a  relatively narrow arena whose basic principles are already fairly well  understood. Meanwhile, knowledge in the relevant fields is increasing  exponentially. 214 the beginning of infinity Sometimes ‘immortality’ (in this sense) is even regarded as undesir- able. For instance, there are arguments from overpopulation; but those  are examples of the Malthusian prophetic fallacy: what each additional  surviving person would need to survive at present-day standards of  living is easily calculated; what knowledge that person would contri- bute to the solution of the resulting problems is unknowable. There  are also arguments about the stultification of society caused by the  entrenchment of old people in positions of power; but the traditions  of criticism in our society are already well adapted to solving that sort  of problem. Even today, it is common in Western countries for powerful  politicians or business executives to be removed from office while still  in good health.  There is a traditional optimistic story that runs as follows. Our hero  is a prisoner who has been sentenced to death by a tyrannical king,  but gains a reprieve by promising to teach the king’s favourite horse  to talk within a year. That night, a fellow prisoner asks what possessed  him to make such a bargain. He replies, ‘A lot can happen in a year.  The horse might die. The king might die. I might die. Or the horse  might talk!’ The prisoner understands that, while his immediate  problems have to do with prison bars and the king and his horse,  ultimately the evil he faces is caused by insufficient knowledge. That  makes him an optimist. He knows that, if progress is to be made, some  of the opportunities and some of the discoveries will be inconceivable  in advance. Progress cannot take place at all unless someone is open  to, and prepares for, those inconceivable possibilities. The prisoner  may or may not discover a way of teaching the horse to talk. But he  may discover something else. He may persuade the king to repeal the  law that he had broken; he may learn a convincing conjuring trick in  which the horse would seem to talk; he may escape; he may think of  an achievable task that would please the king even more than making  the horse talk. The list is infinite. Even if every such possibility is  unlikely, it takes only one of them to be realized for the whole problem  to be solved. But if our prisoner is going to escape by creating a new  idea, he cannot possibly know that idea today, and therefore he cannot  let the assumption that it will never exist condition his planning. Optimism implies all the other necessary conditions for knowledge  to grow, and for knowledge-creating civilizations to last, and hence  215 Optimism for the beginning of infinity. We have, as Popper put it, a duty to be  optimistic – in general, and about civilization in particular. One can  argue that saving civilization will be difficult. That does not mean that  there is a low probability of solving the associated problems. When we  say that a mathematical problem is hard to solve, we do not mean that  it is  unlikely  to be solved. All sorts of factors determine whether  mathematicians even address a problem, and with what effort. If an  easy problem is not deemed to be interesting or useful, they might leave  it unsolved indefinitely, while hard problems are solved all the time. Usually the hardness of a problem is one of the very factors that  cause it to be solved. Thus President John F. Kennedy said in 1962, in  a celebrated example of an optimistic approach to the unknown, ‘We  choose to go to the moon. We choose to go to the moon in this decade  and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they  are hard.’ Kennedy did not mean that the moon project, being hard,  was unlikely to succeed. On the contrary, he believed that it would.  What he meant by a hard task was one that depends on facing the  unknown. And the intuitive fact to which he was appealing was that  although such hardness is always a negative factor when choosing  among  means  to pursue an objective, when choosing the objective itself  it can be a positive one, because we want to engage with projects that  will involve creating new knowledge. And an optimist expects the  creation of knowledge to constitute progress – including its unforesee- able consequences. Thus, Kennedy remarked that======================================================== the attack on the United States on 11 September 2001, millions of people  worldwide have believed it was carried out by the US government, or  the Israeli secret service. Those are purely factual misconceptions,    yet they bear the imprint of moral wrongness just as clearly as a fossil  – made of purely inorganic material – bears the imprint of ancient    life. And the link, in both cases, is explanation. To concoct a  moral   explanation for why Westerners deserve to be killed indiscriminately,  one needs to explain  factually  that the West is not what it pretends to  be – and that requires uncritical acceptance of conspiracy theories,  denials of history, and so on. Quite generally, in order to understand the moral landscape in terms  of a given set of values, one needs to understand some facts as being  a certain way too. And the converse is also true: for example, as the  philosopher Jacob Bronowski pointed out, success at making factual,  scientific discoveries entails a commitment to all sorts of values that  are necessary for making progress. The individual scientist has to value  truth, and good explanations, and be open to ideas and to change. The  scientific community, and to some extent the civilization as a whole,  has to value tolerance, integrity and openness of debate.  We should not be surprised at these connections. The truth has  structural unity as well as logical consistency, and I guess that no true  explanation is entirely disconnected from any other. Since the universe  is explicable, it must be that morally right values are connected in    this way with true factual theories, and morally wrong values with  false theories. Moral philosophy is basically about the problem of what to do next  122 the beginning of infinity – and, more generally, what sort of life to lead, and what sort of world  to want. Some philosophers confine the term ‘moral’ to problems  about how one should treat other people. But such problems are  continuous with problems of individuals choosing what sort of life  to lead, which is why I adopt the more inclusive definition. Terminology  aside, if you were suddenly the last human on Earth, you would be  wondering what sort of life to want. Deciding ‘I should do whatever  pleases me most’ would give you very little clue, because what pleases  you depends on your moral judgement of what constitutes a good  life, not vice versa. This also illustrates the emptiness of reductionism in philosophy. For  if I ask you for advice about what objectives to pursue in life, it is no  good telling me to do what the laws of physics mandate. I shall do that  in any case. Nor is it any good telling me to do what I prefer, because  I don’t know what I prefer to do until I have decided what sort of life  I want to lead or how I should want the world to be. Since our preferences  are shaped in this way, at least in part, by our moral explanations, it  does not make sense to define right and wrong entirely in terms of their  utility in meeting people’s preferences. Trying to do so is the project of  the influential moral philosophy known as  utili  tarianism , which played  much the same role as empiricism did in the philosophy of science: it  acted as a liberating focus for the rebellion against traditional dogmas,  while its own positive content contained little truth.  So there is no avoiding what-to-do-next problems, and, since the  distinction between right and wrong appears in our best explanations  that address such problems, we must regard that distinction as real. In  other words, there is an objective difference between right and wrong:  those are real attributes of objectives and behaviours. In Chapter 14    I shall argue that the same is true in the field of aesthetics: there is such  a thing as objective beauty. Beauty, right and wrong, primality, infinite sets – they all exist  objectively. But not physically. What does that mean? Certainly they  can affect you – as examples like Hofstadter’s show – but apparently  not in the same sense that physical objects do. You cannot trip over  one of them in the street. However, there is less to that distinction than  our empiricism-biased common sense assumes. First of all, being  affected  by a physical object means that something about the physical  123 The Reality of Abstractions object has caused a change, via the laws of physics (or, equivalently,  that the laws of physics have caused a change via that object). But  causation and the laws of physics are not themselves physical objects.  They are abstractions, and our knowledge of them comes – just as for  all other abstractions – from the fact that our best explanations invoke  them. Progress depends on explanation, and therefore trying to conceive  of the world as merely a sequence of events with unexplained regularities  would entail giving up on progress. This argument that abstractions really exist does not tell us what  they exist  as  – for instance, which of them are======================================================== becoming  increasingly significant in world politics. Even in the West, the Enlightenment today is nowhere near complete.  It is relatively advanced in a few, vital areas: the physical sciences and  Western political and economic institutions are prime examples. In  those areas ideas are now fairly open to criticism and experimentation,  and to choice and change. But in many other areas memes are still  replicated in the old manner, by means that suppress the recipients’  critical faculties and ignore their preferences. When girls strive to    be ladylike and to meet culturally defined standards of shape and  appearance, and when boys do their utmost to look strong and not to  cry when distressed, they are struggling to replicate ancient ‘gender- stereotyping’ memes that are still part of our culture – despite the fact  that explicitly endorsing them has become a stigmatized behaviour.  Those memes have the effect of preventing vast ranges of ideas about  what sort of life one should lead from ever crossing the holders’ minds.  If their thoughts ever wander in the forbidden directions, they feel  uneasiness and embarrassment, and the same sort of fear and loss of  centredness as religious people have felt since time immemorial at the  thought of betraying their gods. And their world views and critical  faculties are left disabled in precisely such a way that they will in due  course draw the next generation into the same pattern of thought    and behaviour. That anti-rational memes are still, today, a substantial part of our  culture, and of the mind of every individual, is a difficult fact for us to  accept. Ironically, it is harder for us than it would have been for the  profoundly closed-minded people of earlier societies. They would not  have been troubled by the proposition that most of their lives were  spent enacting elaborate rituals rather than making their own choices  and pursuing their own goals. On the contrary, the degree to which a  person’s life was controlled by duty, obedience to authority, piety, faith  and so on was the very measure by which people judged themselves  and others. Children who asked why they were required to enact  onerous behaviours that did not seem functional would be told ‘Because  I say so’, and in due course they would give their children the same  392 the beginning of infinity reply to the same question, never realizing that they were giving the  full explanation. (This is a curious type of meme whose explicit content  is true though its holders do not believe it.) But today, with our  eagerness for change and our unprecedented openness to new ideas  and to self-criticism, it conflicts with most people’s self-image that we  are still, to a significant degree, the slaves of anti-rational memes. Most  of us would admit to having a hang-up or two, but in the main we  consider our behaviour to be determined by our own decisions, and  our decisions by our reasoned assessment of the arguments and evi  - dence about what is in our rational self-interest. This rational self-image  is itself a recent development of our society, many of whose memes  explicitly promote, and implicitly give effect to, values such as reason,  freedom of thought, and the inherent value of individual human beings.  We naturally try to explain ourselves in terms of meeting those values. Obviously there is truth in this; but it is not the whole story. One  need look no further than our clothing styles, and the way we decorate  our homes, to find evidence. Consider how you would be judged by  other people if you went shopping in pyjamas, or painted your home  with blue and brown stripes. That gives a hint of the narrowness    of the conventions that govern even these objectively trivial and  inconsequential choices about style, and the steepness of the social  costs of violating them. Is the same thing true of the more momentous  patterns in our lives, such as careers, relationships, education, morality,  political outlook and national identity? Consider what we should  expect  to happen when a static society is gradually switching from  anti-rational to rational memes. Such a transition is necessarily gradual, because keeping a dynamic  society stable requires a great deal of knowledge. Creating that know- ledge, starting with only the means available in a static society – namely  small amounts of creativity and knowledge, many misconceptions,    the blind evolution of memes, and trial and error – must necessarily    take time. Moreover, the society has to continue to function throughout. But  the coexistence of rational and anti-rational memes makes this tran- sition unstable. Memes of each type cause behaviours that impede the  faithful replication of the other: to replicate faithfully, anti-rational  memes need people to avoid thinking critically about their choices,  393 The Evolution of Culture while rational memes need people to think as critically as possible.

Creationism thus faces an inherent dilemma: is the  designer a purely supernatural being – one who was ‘just there’, com  - plete with all that knowledge – or not? A being who was ‘just there’  would serve no explanatory purpose (in regard to the biosphere), since  then one could more economically say that the biosphere itself ‘just  happened’, complete with that same knowledge, embodied in organisms.  On the other hand, to whatever extent a creationist theory provides  explanations about how supernatural beings designed and created the  biosphere, they are no longer supernatural beings but merely unseen  ones. They might, for instance, be an extraterrestrial civilization. But  then the theory is not really creationism – unless it proposes that    80 the beginning of infinity the extraterrestrial designers themselves had supernatural designers.  Moreover, the designer of any adaptation must by definition have  had the  intention  that the adaptation be as it is. But that is hard to  reconcile with the designer envisaged in virtually all creationist theories,  namely a deity or deities worthy of worship; for the reality is that many  biological adaptations have distinctly suboptimal features. For instance,  the eyes of vertebrates have their ‘wiring’ and blood supply  in front  of  the retina, where they absorb and scatter incoming light and so degrade  the image. There is also a blind spot where the optic nerve passes  through the retina on its way to the brain. The eyes of some inverte- brates, such as squids, have the same basic design but without those  design flaws. The effect of the flaws on the efficiency of the eye is small;  but the point is that they are wholly contrary to the eye’s functional  purpose, and so conflict with the idea that that purpose was intended  by a divine designer. As Charles Darwin put it in  The Origin of Species ,  ‘On the view of each organism with all its separate parts having been  specially created, how utterly inexplicable is it that organs bearing the  plain stamp of inutility . . . should so frequently occur.’ There are even examples of  non -functional design. For instance,  most animals have a gene for synthesizing vitamin C, but in primates,  including humans, though that gene is recognizably present ,  it is faulty:  it does not do anything. This is very difficult to account for except as  a vestigial feature that primates have inherited from non-primate  ancestors. One could retreat to the position that all these apparently  poor design features do have some undiscovered purpose. But that is  a bad explanation: it could be used to claim that  any  poorly designed  or undesigned entity was perfectly designed. Another assumed characteristic of the designer according to most  religions is benevolence. But, as I mentioned in Chapter 3, the biosphere  is much less pleasant for its inhabitants than anything that a benevolent,  or even halfway decent, human designer would design. In theological  contexts this is known as ‘the problem of suffering’ or ‘the problem of  evil’, and is frequently used as an argument against the existence of  God. But in that role it is easily brushed off. Typical defences are that  perhaps morality is different for a supernatural being; or perhaps we  are too limited intellectually to be able to understand how moral the  biosphere really is. However, here I am concerned not with whether  81 Creation God exists, only with how to explain biological adaptations, and in  that regard those defences of creationism have the same fatal flaw as  the Haldane–Dawkins argument (Chapter 3): a world that is ‘queerer  than we  can  suppose’ is indistinguishable from a world ‘tricked out  with magic’. So all such explanations are bad.  The central flaw of creationism – that its account of how the know- ledge in adaptations could possibly be created is either missing, super- natural or illogical – is also the central flaw of pre-Enlightenment,  authoritative conceptions of  human  knowledge. In some versions it is  literally the same theory, with certain types of knowledge (such as  cosmology or moral knowledge and other rules of behaviour) being  spoken to early humans by supernatural beings. In others, parochial  features of society (such as the existence of monarchs in govern-  ment, or indeed the existence of God in the universe) are protected by  taboos or taken so uncritically for granted that they are not even  recognized as ideas. And I shall discuss the  evolution  of such ideas and  institutions in Chapter 15. The prospect of the unlimited creation of knowledge in the future  conflicts with creationism by undercutting its motivation. For eventu- ally, with the assistance of what we would consider stupendously  powerful computers, any child will be capable of designing and im    - plementing a better, more complex, more beautiful, and also far more  moral biosphere than the======================================================== the other and to make it run towards  or away from it respectively, while other genes evolve to make their  organism hard to recognize against the relevant background. That is  why tigers are striped.  Occasionally it happens by chance that the parochial criteria of  attractiveness that evolved within a species produce something that  looks beautiful to us: the peacock’s tail is an example. But that is a    rare anomaly: in the overwhelming majority of species, we do not share  any of their criteria for finding something attractive. Yet with flowers  – most flowers – we do. Sometimes a leaf can be beautiful; even a  puddle of water can. But, again, only by rare chance. With flowers it  is reliable.  It is another regularity in nature. What is the explanation? Why are  flowers beautiful? Given the prevailing assumptions in the scientific community – which  are still rather empiricist and reductionist – it may seem plausible that  flowers are not objectively beautiful, and that their attractiveness is  merely a cultural phenomenon. But I think that that fails closer inspec- tion. We find flowers beautiful that we have never seen before, and  which have not been known to our culture before – and quite reliably,  for most humans in most cultures. The same is not true of the  roots   of plants, or the leaves. Why only the flowers? One unusual aspect of the flower–insect co-evolution is that it  involved the creation of a complex code, or language, for signalling  information between  species . It had to be complex because the genes  were facing a difficult communication problem. The code had to be,  on the one hand, easily recognizable by the right insects, and, on the  other, difficult to forge by other species of flower – for if other species  could cause their pollen to be spread by the same insects without having  to manufacture nectar for them, which requires energy, they would  have a selective advantage. So the criterion that was evolving in the  insects had to be discriminating enough to pick the right flowers and  not crude imitations; and the flowers’ design had to be such that no  design that other flower species could easily evolve could be mistaken  for it. Thus both the criterion and the means of meeting it had to be  hard to vary. 362 the beginning of infinity When genes are facing a similar problem  within  a species, notably  in the co-evolution of criteria and characteristics for choosing mates,  they already have a large amount of shared genetic knowledge to draw  on. For instance, even before any such co-evolution begins, the genome  may already contain adaptations for recognizing fellow members of  the species, and for detecting various attributes of them. Moreover, the  attributes that a mate is searching for may initially be objectively useful  ones – such as neck length in a giraffe. One theory of the evolution of  giraffe necks is that it began as an adaptation for feeding, but then  continued through sexual selection. However, there is no such shared  knowledge to build on across the gap between distant species. They  are starting from scratch. And therefore my guess is that the easiest way to signal across such  a gap with hard-to-forge patterns designed to be recognized by hard- to-emulate pattern-matching algorithms is to use  objective  standards  of beauty. So flowers have to create objective beauty, and insects have  to recognize objective beauty. Consequently the only species that are  attracted by flowers are the insect species that co-evolved to do so –  and humans.  If true, this means that Dawkins’ daughter was partly right about  the flowers after all. They  are  there to make the world pretty; or, at  least, prettiness is no accidental side effect but is what they specifically  evolved to have. Not because anything intended the world to be pretty,  but because the best-replicating genes depend on embodying  objective  prettiness  to get themselves replicated. The case of honey, for instance,  is very different. The reason that honey – which is sugar water – is easy  for flowers and bees to make, and why its taste is attractive to humans  and insects alike, is that we  do  all have a shared genetic heritage going  back to our common ancestor and before, which includes biochemical  knowledge about many uses of sugar, and the means to recognize it. Could it be that what humans find attractive in flowers – or in art  – is indeed objective, but it is not objective  beauty ? Perhaps it is  something more mundane – something like a liking for bright colours,  strong contrasts, symmetrical shapes. Humans seem to have an inborn  liking for symmetry. It is thought to be a factor in sexual attractiveness,  and it may also be useful in helping us to classify things and to organize  our environment physically and conceptually. So a side effect of these  363 Why are Flowers Beautiful?  inborn preferences might be a liking for flowers, which happen to be  colourful and symmetrical.======================================================== robots ever had marriages they would be  eternal: ‘Till rust do us part’. In that passage,  Elbot ’s first utterance is not a reply to the question but  presumably a stock response triggered by the keywords ‘Turing test’.  In the following line, the judge uses the word ‘spose’, which in that  context can only mean ‘suppose’ (either as slang or as a typographical  error). But  Elbot  presumably interprets it as ‘spouse’, and responds  with a stock joke about marriage. Hence, even from this exchange  alone, it is clear that  Elbot  was not processing the  meanings  of the  judge’s sentences.  judge:   so what do you do when you’re not chatting to me  then? elbot:   I have the same trouble when I shop for oil. Should  I buy the extra oily, the super oily, or the ultra  oily. There’s no way to tell. judge:   how about your career? does that involve oil? 152 the beginning of infinity elbot:   Well what about humans and occupation? Where do  they stand on this? When the judge helpfully took up  Elbot ’s randomly introduced theme  of oil,  Elbot  ignored it. Instead, having detected the keyword ‘career’,  it converted it to the synonym ‘occupation’ and inserted it into a stock  sentence pattern. This is how much success the quest for ‘machines that think’ had  achieved in the  fifty-eight   years  following Turing’s paper: nil. Yet,  in every other respect, computer science and technology had made  astounding progress during that period. The dwindling group of op    - ponents of the very possibility of AI are no doubt unsurprised by this  failure – for the wrong reason: they do not appreciate the significance  of universality. But the most passionate  enthusiasts  for the imminence  of AI do not appreciate the significance of the failure. Some claim that  the above criticism is unfair: modern AI research is not focused on  passing the Turing test, and great progress has been made in what is  now called ‘AI’ in many specialized applications. However, none of  those applications look like ‘machines that think’.* Others maintain  that the criticism is premature, because, during most of the history of  the field, computers had absurdly little speed and memory capacity  compared with today’s. Hence they continue to expect the breakthrough  in the next few years.  This will not do either. It is not as though someone has written a  chatbot that could pass the Turing test but would currently take a year  to compute each reply. People would gladly wait. And in any case, if  anyone knew how to write such a program, there would be no need  to wait – for reasons that I shall get to shortly. In his 1950 paper, Turing estimated that, to pass his test, an AI  program together with all its data would require no more than about  100 megabytes of memory, that the computer would need to be no  faster than computers were at the time (about ten thousand operations  per second), and that by the year 2000 ‘one will be able to speak of  machines thinking without expecting to be contradicted.’ Well, the  year 2000 has come and gone, the laptop computer on which I am  writing this book has over a thousand times as much memory as Turing  * Hence what I am calling ‘AI’ is sometimes called ‘AGI’: Artificial  General  Intelligence. 153 Artificial Creativity specified (counting hard-drive space), and about a million times the  speed (though it is not clear from his paper what account he was taking  of the brain’s parallel processing). But it can no more think than  Turing’s slide rule could. I am just as sure as Turing was that it  could  be programmed to think; and this might indeed require as few re-  sources as Turing estimated, even though orders of magnitude more  are available today. But with what program? And why is there no sign  of such a program? Intelligence in the general-purpose sense that Turing meant is one of  a constellation of attributes of the human mind that have been puzzling  philosophers for millennia; others include consciousness, free will, and  meaning. A typical such puzzle is that of  qualia  (singular  quale , which  rhymes with ‘baa-lay’) – meaning the subjective aspect of sensations.  So for instance the sensation of seeing the colour blue is a quale.  Consider the following thought experiment. You are a biochemist with  the misfortune to have been born with a genetic defect that disables  the blue receptors in your retinas. Consequently you have a form of  colour blindness in which you are able to see only red and green, and  mixtures of the two such as yellow, but anything purely blue also looks  to you like one of those mixtures. Then you discover a cure that will  cause your blue receptors to start working. Before administering the  cure to yourself, you can confidently make certain predictions about  what will happen if it works. One of them is that, when you hold up  a blue card as a test, you will see a colour that you have never seen  before. You can predict that you will call it ‘blue’, because you======================================================== ideas are original, and occasionally one of  them would actually help. It need be only a small, tentative improve- ment: a way of hunting or growing food with slightly less effort, or of  making slightly better tools; a better way of recording debts or laws;  a subtle change in the relationship between husband and wife, or  between parent and child; a slightly different attitude towards the  society’s rulers or gods. What will happen next?  The person with that idea may well want to tell other people. Those  who believe the idea will see that it could make life a little less nasty,  brutish and short. They will tell their families and friends, and they  theirs. This idea will be competing in people’s minds with other ideas  about how to make life better, most of them presumably false. But  suppose, for the sake of argument, that this particular true idea happens  to be believed, and spreads through the society. Then the society will have been changed. It may not have changed  very much, but this was merely the change caused by a single person,  thinking of a single idea. So multiply all that by the number of thinking  minds in the society, and by a lifetime’s worth of thought in each of  them, and let this continue for only a few generations, and the result  is an exponentially increasing, revolutionary force transforming every  aspect of the society. But in a static society that beginning of infinity never happens.  Despite the fact that I have assumed nothing other than that people  try to improve their lives, and that they cannot transmit their ideas  perfectly, and that information subject to variation and selection  evolves, I have entirely failed to imagine a static society in this story.  For a society to be static, something else must be happening as well.  One thing my story did not take into account is that static societies  have customs and laws – taboos – that prevent their memes from  changing. They enforce the enactment of the existing memes, forbid  the enactment of variants, and suppress criticism of the status quo.  However, that alone could not suppress change. First,  no  enactment  of a meme is completely identical to that of the previous generation.  It is infeasible to specify every aspect of acceptable behaviour with  382 the beginning of infinity perfect precision. Second, it is impossible to tell in advance which small  deviations from traditional behaviour would initiate further changes.  Third, once a variant idea has begun to spread to even one more person  – which means that people are preferring it – preventing it from being  transmitted further is extremely difficult. Therefore no society could  remain static solely by suppressing new ideas once they have been  created.  That is why the enforcement of the status quo is only ever a  secondary method of preventing change – a mopping-up operation.  The primary method is always – and can only be – to disable the source  of new ideas, namely human creativity. So static societies always have  traditions of bringing up children in ways that disable their creativity  and critical faculties. That ensures that most of the new ideas that  would have been capable of changing the society are never thought  of in the first place.  How is this done? The details are variable and not relevant here, but  the sort of thing that happens is that people growing up in such a  society acquire a set of values for judging themselves and everyone else  which amounts to ridding themselves of distinctive attributes and  seeking only conformity with the society’s constitutive memes. They  not only enact those memes: they see themselves as existing only in  order to enact them. So, not only do such societies enforce qualities  such as obedience, piety and devotion to duty, their members’ sense of  their own selves is invested in the same standards. People know no  others. So they feel pride and shame, and form all their aspirations and  opinions, by the criterion of how thoroughly they subordinate them- selves to the society’s memes.  How do memes ‘know’ how to achieve all such complex, reproducible  effects on the ideas and behaviour of human beings? They do not,    of course,  know : they are not sentient beings. They merely contain  that knowledge implicitly. How did they come by that knowledge? It  evolved. The memes exist, at any instant, in many variant forms, and  those are subject to selection in favour of  faithful replication . For every  long-lived meme of a static society, millions of variants of it will have  fallen by the wayside because they lacked that tiny extra piece of  information, that extra degree of ruthless efficiency in preventing    rivals from being thought of or acted upon, that slight advantage in  383 The Evolution of Culture psychological leverage, or whatever it took to make it spread through  the population better than its rivals and, once it was prevalent, to get  it copied and enacted with just that extra degree of======================================================== explanations, not justifications, and one does this  creatively, using conjecture, tempered by every kind of criticism. It is in  the nature of good explanations – being hard to vary – that there is  only one of them. Having created it, one is no longer tempted by the  alternatives. They have been not outweighed, but out-argued, refuted  and abandoned. During the course of a creative process, one is not  struggling to distinguish between countless different explanations of  nearly equal merit; typically, one is struggling to create even one good  explanation, and, having succeeded, one is glad to be rid of the rest. Another misconception to which the idea of decision-making by  weighing sometimes leads is that problems can be solved by weighing  – in particular, that disputes between advocates of rival explanations  342 the beginning of infinity can be resolved by creating a weighted average of their proposals. But  the fact is that a good explanation, being hard to vary at all without  losing its explanatory power, is hard to mix with a rival explanation:  something halfway between them is usually worse than either of them  separately. Mixing two explanations to create a  better  explanation  requires an additional act of creativity. That is why good explanations  are discrete – separated from each other by bad explanations –    and why, when choosing between explanations, we are faced with  discrete options. In complex decisions, the creative phase is often followed by a  mechanical, perspiration phase in which one ties down details of the  explanation that are not yet hard to vary but can be made so by  non-creative means. For example, an architect whose client asks how  tall a skyscraper can be built, given certain constraints, does not just  calculate that number from a formula. The decision-making process  may  end  with such a calculation, but it begins creatively, with ideas  for how the client’s priorities and constraints might best be met by a  new design. And, before that, the clients had to decide – creatively –  what those priorities and constraints should be. At the beginning of  that process they would not have been aware of all the preferences that  they would end up presenting to architects. Similarly, a voter may look  through lists of the various parties’ policies, and may even assign each  issue a ‘weight’ to represent its importance; but one can do that only  after  one has thought about one’s political philosophy, and has ex    - plained to one’s own satisfaction how important that makes the various  issues, what policies the various parties are likely to adopt in regard  to those issues, and so on. The type of ‘decision’ considered in social-choice theory is choosing  from options that are known and fixed, according to preferences that  are known, fixed and consistent. The quintessential example is a voter’s  choice, in the polling booth, not of which candidate to prefer but of  which box to check. As I have explained, this is a grossly inadequate,  and inaccurate, model of human decision-making. In reality, the voter  is choosing between explanations, not checkboxes, and, while very few  voters choose to affect the checkboxes themselves, by running for office,  all rational voters create their own explanation for which checkbox  they personally should choose. 343 Choices So it is not true that decision-making necessarily suffers from those  crude irrationalities – not because there is anything wrong with Arrow’s  theorem or any of the other no-go theorems, but because social-choice  theory is itself based on false assumptions about what thinking and  deciding consist of. It is Zeno’s mistake. It is mistaking an abstract  process that it has  named  decision-making for the real-life process of  the same name.  Similarly, what is called a ‘dictator’ in Arrow’s theorem is not neces- sarily a dictator in the ordinary sense of the word. It is simply any  agent to whom the society’s decision-making rules assign the sole right  to make a particular decision regardless of the preferences of anyone  else. Thus, every law that requires an individual’s consent for some-  thing – such as the law against rape, or against involuntary surgery  – establishes a ‘dictatorship’ in the technical sense used in Arrow’s  theorem. Everyone is a dictator over their own body. The law against  theft establishes a dictatorship over one’s own possessions. A free  election is, by definition, one in which every voter is a dictator over  their own ballot paper. Arrow’s theorem itself assumes that all the  participants are in sole control of their  contributions  to the decision- making process. More generally, the most important conditions for  rational decision-making – such as freedom of thought and of speech,  tolerance of dissent, and the self-determination of individuals – all  require ‘dictatorships’ in Arrow’s mathematical sense. It is under- standable that he chose that term. But it has nothing to do with======================================================== explanations of the biosphere either fail to address the  problem of how the knowledge in adaptations is created or they explain  it badly. That is to say, they all underrate  creation  – and, ironically, the  theory that underrates creation most of all is creationism. Consider  this: if a supernatural creator were to have created the universe at the  moment when Einstein or Darwin or any great scientist (appeared to  have) just completed their major discovery, then the true creator of  that discovery (and of all earlier discoveries) would have been not that  scientist but the supernatural being. So such a theory would deny the  existence of the only creation that really did take place in the genesis  of that scientist’s discoveries. And it really is creation. Before a discovery is made, no predictive  process could reveal the content or the consequences of that discovery.  For if it could, it would be that discovery. So scientific discovery is  profoundly unpredictable, despite the fact that it is determined by the  laws of physics. I shall say more about this curious fact in the next  chapter; in short, it is due to the existence of ‘emergent’ levels of  explanation. In this case, the upshot is that what science – and creative  thought in general – achieves is unpredictable creation  ex nihilo . So  does biological evolution. No other process does. Creationism, therefore, is misleadingly named. It is not a theory  explaining knowledge as being due to creation, but the opposite: it is  denying that creation happened in reality, by placing the origin of the  knowledge in an explanationless realm. Creationism is really  creation   denial  – and so are all those other false explanations.  The puzzle of understanding what living things are and how they  came about has given rise to a strange history of misconceptions, near- misses and ironies.

The main similarities: genes and ideas are both replicators; knowledge  and adaptations are both hard to vary. The main difference: human  knowledge can be explanatory and can have great reach; adaptations  are never explanatory and rarely have much reach beyond the situations  106 the beginning of infinity in which they evolved. False explanations of biological evolution have  counterparts in false explanations of the growth of human knowledge.  For instance, Lamarckism is the counterpart of inductivism. William  Paley’s version of the argument from design clarified what does or does  not have the ‘appearance of design’ and hence what cannot be explained  as the outcome of chance alone – namely hard-to-vary adaptation to  a purpose. The origin of this must be the creation of knowledge. Bio  -   logical evolution does not optimize benefits to the species, the group,  the individual or even the gene, but only the ability of the gene to  spread through the population. Such benefits can nevertheless happen  because of the universality of laws of nature and the reach of some of  the knowledge that is created. The ‘fine-tuning’ of the laws or constants  of physics has been used as a modern form of the argument from  design. For the usual reasons, it is not a good argument for a supernatural  cause. But ‘anthropic’ theories that try to account for it as a pure  selection effect from an infinite number of different universes are, by  themselves, bad explanations too – in part because most logically  possible laws are themselves bad explanations. 107 5 The Reality of Abstractions The fundamental theories of modern physics explain the world in  jarringly counter-intuitive ways. For example, most======================================================== nesting materials, and so on. Suppose that  initially the whole population has genes that cause them to nest at that  90 the beginning of infinity optimum time. That would mean that those genes were well adapted  to maximizing the number of birds in the population – which one  might call ‘maximizing the good of the species’. Now suppose that this equilibrium is disturbed by the advent of a  mutant gene in a single bird which causes it to nest slightly earlier –  say, at the end of March. Assume that when a bird has built a nest, the  species’ other behavioural genes are such that it automatically gets  whatever cooperation it needs from a mate. That pair of birds would  then be guaranteed the best nesting site on the island – an advantage  which, in terms of the survival of their offspring, might well outweigh  all the slight disadvantages of nesting earlier. In that case, in the  following generation, there will be more March-nesting birds, and,  again, all of them will find excellent nesting sites. That means that a  smaller proportion than usual of the April-nesting variety will find  good sites: the best sites will have been taken by the time they start  looking. In subsequent generations, the balance of the population    will keep shifting towards the March-nesting variants. If the relative  advantage of having the best nesting sites is large enough, the April- nesting variant could even become extinct. If it arises again as a  mutation, its holder will have no offspring, because all sites will have  been taken by the time it tries to nest. Thus the original situation that we imagined – with genes that    were optimally adapted to maximizing the population (‘benefiting the  species’) – is unstable. There will be evolutionary pressure to make the  genes become  less  well adapted to that function. This change has harmed the species, in the sense of reducing its total  population (because the birds are no longer nesting at the optimum  time). It may thereby also have harmed it by increasing the risk of  extinction, making it less likely to spread to other habitats, and so on.  So an optimally adapted species may in this way evolve into one that  is less ‘well off’ by any measure. If a further mutant gene then appears, causing nesting still earlier in  March, the same process may be repeated, with the earlier-nesting  genes taking over and the total population falling again. Evolution will  thus drive the nesting time ever earlier, and the population lower. A  new equilibrium would be reached only when the advantage to an  individual bird’s offspring of getting the very best nesting site was  91 Creation finally outweighed by the  dis advantages of slightly earlier nesting. That  equilibrium might be very far from what was optimal for the species. A related misconception is that evolution is always  adaptive  – that  it always constitutes progress, or at least some sort of improvement in  useful functionality which it then acts to optimize. This is often summed  up in a phrase due to the philosopher Herbert Spencer, and unfortunately  taken up by Darwin himself: ‘the survival of the fittest’. But, as the  above thought experiment illustrates, that is not the case either. Not  only has the species been harmed by this evolutionary change, every  individual bird has been harmed as well: the birds using any particular  site now have a harsher life than before, because they are using it earlier  in the year. Thus, although the existence of progress in the biosphere is what  the theory of evolution is there to explain, not all evolution constitutes  progress, and no (genetic) evolution optimizes progress.  What exactly  has  the evolution of those birds achieved during that  period? It has optimized not the functional adaptation of a variant  gene to its environment – the attribute that would have impressed Paley  – but the relative ability of the surviving variant to  spread through the  population . An April-nesting gene is no longer able to propagate itself  to the next generation, even though it is functionally the best variant.  The early-nesting gene that replaced it may still be tolerably functional,  but it is  fittest  for nothing except preventing variants of itself from  procreating. From the point of view of both the species and all its  members, the change brought about by this period of its evolution has  been a disaster. But evolution does not ‘care’ about that. It favours only  the genes that spread best through the population. Evolution can even favour genes that are not just suboptimal, but  wholly harmful to the species and all its individuals. A famous example  is the peacock’s large, colourful tail, which is believed to diminish the  bird’s viability by making it harder to evade predators, and to have no  useful function at all. Genes for prominent tails dominate simply  because peahens tend to choose prominent-tailed males as mates. Why  was there selection pressure in favour of such======================================================== different histories: in one, comprising  half  the original  set of universes, the couple in question are still single; in the second,  comprising a  quarter  of the original set, they are married; and in the  third, comprising the remaining quarter, they are divorced.  Thus the three histories do not occupy equal proportions of the  multiverse. There are twice as many universes in which the couple never  married as there are universes in which they divorced.  Now suppose that scientists on the starship know about the multi- verse and understand the physics of the transporter. (Though note that  we have not yet given them a way of discovering those things.) Then  they know that, when they run the transporter, an infinite number of  fungible instances of themselves, all sharing the same history, are doing  so at the same time. They know that a voltage surge will occur in half  the universes in that history, which means that it will split into two  histories of equal measure. Hence they know that, if they use a voltmeter  capable of detecting the surge, half of the instances of themselves are  going to find that it has recorded one, and the other half are not. But  they also know that it is meaningless to ask (not merely impossible to  know)  which  event they will experience. Consequently they can make  two closely related predictions. One is that, despite the perfect deter- minism of everything that is happening,  nothing  can reliably predict  for them whether the voltmeter will detect a surge.  The other prediction is simply that the voltmeter will record a surge  with probability one-half. Thus the outcomes of such experiments are  subjectively random  (from the perspective of any observer) even though  278 the beginning of infinity everything that is happening is completely determined objectively. This  is also the origin of quantum-mechanical randomness and probability  in real physics: it is due to the measure that the theory provides for  the multiverse, which is in turn due to what kinds of physical processes  the theory allows and forbids. Notice that when a random outcome (in this sense) is about to  happen, it is a situation of diversity within fungibility: the diversity is  in the variable ‘what outcome they are  going  to see’. The logic of the  situation is the same as in cases like that of the bank account I discussed  above, except that this time the fungible entities are people. They are  fungible, yet half of them are going to see the surge and the other half  not. In practice they could test this prediction by doing the experiment  many times. Every formula purporting to predict the sequence of  outcomes will eventually fail: that tests the unpredictability. And in  the overwhelming majority of universes (and histories) the surge will  happen approximately half the time: that tests the predicted value of  the probability. Only a tiny proportion of the instances of the observers  will see anything different.  Our story continues. In one of the histories, the newspapers on the  astronauts’ home planets report the engagement. They fill many  column-inches with reports about the accident that brought the  astronauts together and so on. In the other history, where there is no  astronaut-engagement news, one newspaper fills the same space on the  page with a short story. It happens to be about a romance on a starship.  Some of the sentences in that story are identical to sentences in the  news items in the other history. The same words, printed in the same  column in the same newspaper, are fungible between the two histories;  but they are fiction in one history and fact in the other. So here the  fact/fiction attribute has diversity within fungibility. The number of distinct histories will now increase rapidly. Whenever  the transporter is used, it takes only microseconds for the sphere of  differentiation to engulf the whole starship, so, if it is typically used  ten times per day, the number of distinct histories inside the whole  starship will double about ten times a day. Within a month there will  be more distinct histories than there are atoms in our visible universe.  Most of them will be extremely similar to many others, because in only  279 The Multiverse a small proportion will the precise timing and magnitude of the voltage  surge be just right to precipitate a noticeable,  Sliding Doors -type  change. Nevertheless, the number of histories continues to increase  exponentially, and soon there are so many variations on events that  several significant changes have been caused  somewhere  in the multi- versal diversity of the starship. So the total number of such histories  increases exponentially too, even though they continue to constitute  only a small proportion of all histories that are present. Soon after that, in an even smaller but still exponentially grow-  ing number of histories, uncanny chains of ‘accidents’ and ‘unlikely  coincidences’ will have come to dominate events.

And so  now  the anthropic principle can make testable,  probabilistic predictions. What has made this possible is that the infinite set of universes with  different values of  D  is no longer merely a set. It is a single physical  entity, a multiverse with internal interactions (as harnessed by Lyra’s  device) that relate different parts of it to each other and thereby provide  a unique meaning, known as a  measure , to proportions and averages  over different universes. None of the anthropic-reasoning theories that have been proposed  to solve the fine-tuning problem provides any such measure. Most are  hardly more than speculations of the form ‘What if there were universes  with different physical constants?’ There is, however, one theory in  physics that already describes a multiverse for independent reasons.  All its universes have the same constants of physics, and the interactions  of these universes do not involve travel to, or measurement of, each  other. But it does provide a measure for universes. That theory is  quantum theory, which I shall discuss in Chapter 11.  * 181 A Window on Infinity The definition of infinity in terms of a one-to-one correspondence  between a set and part of itself was original to Cantor. It is connected  only indirectly to the informal, intuitive way that non-mathematicians  have conceived of infinity both before and since – namely that ‘infinite’  means something like ‘bigger than any finite combination of finite  things’. But that informal notion is rather circular unless we have some  independent idea of what makes something  finite , and what makes  a single act of ‘combination’ finite. The intuitive answer would be  anthropocentric: something is definitely finite if it could in principle  be encompassed by a human experience. But what does it mean to  ‘experience’ something? Was Cantor experiencing infinity when he  proved theorems about it? Or was he experiencing only symbols? But  we only  ever  experience symbols.  One can avoid this anthropocentrism by referring instead to measur- ing instruments: a quantity is definitely neither infinite nor infinitesimal  if it could, in principle, register on some measuring instrument. How-  ever, by that definition a quantity can be finite even if the underlying  explanation refers to an infinite set in the mathematical sense. To  display the result of a measurement the needle on a meter might move  by one centimetre, which is a finite distance, but it consists of an  uncountable infinity of points. This can happen because, although  points  appear in lowest-level explanations of what is happening, the  number of points  never appears in predictions. Physics deals in distances,  not numbers of points. Similarly, Newton and Leibniz were able to use  infinitesimal distances to explain physical quantities like instantaneous  velocity, yet there is nothing physically infinitesimal or infinite in, say,  the continuous motion of a projectile. To the management of Infinity Hotel, issuing a finite public-address  announcement is a finite operation, even though it causes a trans- formation involving an infinite number of events in the hotel. On  the other hand,  most  logically possible transformations could be  achieved only with an infinite number of such announcements –  which the laws of physics in their world do not allow. Remember,  no one in Infinity Hotel – neither staff nor guest – ever performs  more than a finite number of actions. Similarly in the Lyra multiverse,  a measuring instrument can take the average of an infinite number  of values during a finite, two-minute expedition. So that is a physically  182 the beginning of infinity finite  operation in that world. But taking the ‘average’ of the same  infinite set in a different order would require an infinite number of  such trips, which, again, would not be possible under those laws of  physics. Only the laws of physics determine what is finite in nature. Failure  to realize this has often caused confusion. The paradoxes of Zeno of  Elea, such as that of Achilles and the tortoise, were early examples. Zeno managed to conclude that, in a race against a tortoise, Achilles  will never overtake the tortoise if it has a head start – because, by the  time Achilles reaches the point where the tortoise began, the tortoise  will have moved on a little. By the time he reaches that new point, it  will have moved a little further, and so on ad infinitum. Thus the  ‘catching-up’ procedure requires Achilles to perform an infinite number  of catching-up steps in a finite time, which as a finite being he  presumably  cannot do.

Quantum computation  Computation in which the flow of in    - formation is not confined to a single history. summary The physical world is a multiverse, and its structure is determined by  how information flows in it. In many regions of the multiverse,  information flows in quasi-autonomous streams called histories, one  of which we call our ‘universe’. Universes approximately obey the laws  of classical (pre-quantum) physics. But we know of the rest of the  multiverse, and can test the laws of quantum physics, because of the  phenomenon of quantum interference. Thus a universe is not an exact  but an emergent feature of the multiverse. One of the most unfamiliar  and counter-intuitive things about the multiverse is fungibility. The  laws of motion of the multiverse are deterministic, and apparent  randomness is due to initially fungible instances of objects becoming  different. In quantum physics, variables are typically discrete, and how  they change from one value to another is a multiversal process involving  interference and fungibility. 305 12 A Physicist’s History of Bad  Philosophy With Some Comments on Bad Science By the way, what I have just outlined is what I call a ‘physi- cist’s history of physics’, which is never correct . . . Richard Feynman,  QED: The Strange Theory of Light and Matter  (1985) reader:  So, I am an  emergent, quasi-autonomous flow of information  in the multiverse.  david: You  are. reader:  And I exist in multiple instances, some of them different  from each other, some not. And those are the  least  weird things about  the world according to quantum theory. david: Yes. reader:  But your argument is that we have no option but to accept  the theory’s implications, because it is the only known explanation  of many phenomena and has survived all known experimental    tests. david:  What other option would you  like  to have? reader:  I’m just summarizing.  david:  Then yes: quantum theory does have universal reach. But if  all you want to explain is how we know that there are other universes,  you don’t have to go via the full theory. You need look no further  than what a Mach–Zehnder interferometer does to a single photon:  the path that was not taken affects the one that was. Or, if you want  the same thing writ large, just think of a quantum computer: its  output will depend on intermediate results being computed in vast  numbers of  different  histories of the  same  few atoms. 306 reader:  But that’s just a few  atoms  existing in multiple instances.  Not people. david:  Are you claiming to be made of something other than atoms? reader: Ah, I  see. david:  Also, imagine a vast cloud of instances of a single photon,  some of which are stopped by a barrier. Are they absorbed by    the barrier that we see, or is each absorbed by a different, quasi- autonomous barrier at the same location? reader:  Does it make a difference? david: Yes. If  they were all absorbed by the barrier we see, it would  vaporize.  reader: So it  would. david:  And we can ask – as I did in the story of the starship and the  twilight zone – what is holding up those barriers? It must be other  instances of the floor. And of the planet. And then we can consider  the experimenters who set all this up and who observe the results,  and so on. reader: So  that trickle of photons through the interferometer really  does provide a window on a vast multiplicity of universes. david: Yes. It’s  another example of reach – just a small portion of  the reach of quantum theory. The explanation of those experiments  in isolation isn’t as hard to vary as the full theory. But in regard to  the existence of other universes it’s incontrovertible all the same. reader:  And that’s all there is to it? david: Yes. reader:  But then why is it that only a small minority of quantum  physicists agree? david:  Bad philosophy. reader:  What’s that? Quantum theory was discovered independently by two physicists who  reached it from different directions: Werner Heisenberg and Erwin  Schrödinger. The latter gave his name to the  Schrödinger equation ,  which is a way of expressing the quantum-mechanical laws of motion.  Both versions of the theory were formulated between 1925 and 1927,  and both explained motion, especially within atoms, in new and as    - tonishingly counter-intuitive ways. Heisenberg’s theory said that the  the beginning of infinity 307 A Physicist’s History of Bad Philosophy physical variables of a particle do not have numerical values. Instead,  they are  matrices======================================================== Indeed, knowledge can aim itself at a target, travel vast distances  having scarcely any effect, and then utterly transform the destination. In our story, too, if we wanted the transporter malfunction to have  a significant physical effect at astronomical distances, it would have  to be via knowledge. All those torrents of photons streaming out of  the starship and carrying, intentionally or unintentionally, information  about a wedding will have a noticeable effect on the distant planet  only if someone there cares about the possibility of such information  enough to set up scientific instruments that could detect it. Now, as I have explained, our imaginary laws of physics which say  that a voltage surge happens ‘in one universe but not the other’ cannot  be deterministic unless the universes are fungible. So, what happens  when the transporter is used again, after the universes are no longer  fungible? Imagine a second starship, of the same type as the first and  far away. What happens if the second starship runs its transporter  immediately after the first one did? One logically possible answer would be that  nothing  happens – in  other words, the laws of physics would say that, once the two universes  are different, all transporters just work normally and never produce    a voltage surge again. However, that would also provide a way of  communicating faster than light, albeit unreliably and only once. You  set up a voltmeter in the transporter room and run the transporter. If  the voltage surges, you know that the other starship, however far away,  276 the beginning of infinity has not yet run its transporter (because, if it had, that would have put  a permanent end to such surges everywhere). The laws governing the  real multiverse do not allow information to flow in that way. If we  want our fictional laws of physics to be universal from the inhabitants’  point of view, the second transporter must do exactly what the first  one did. It must cause a voltage surge in one universe and not in the  other. But in that case something must determine  which  universe the second  surge will happen in. ‘In one universe but not the other’ is no longer  a deterministic specification. Also, a surge must not happen if the  transporter is run  only  in the other universe. That would constitute  inter-universe communication. It must depend on both instances of the  transporter being run simultaneously. Even that could allow some  inter-universe communication, as follows. In the universe where a surge  has once happened, run the transporter at a prearranged time and  observe the voltmeter. If no surge happens, then the transporter in the  other universe is switched off. So we are at an impasse. It is remarkable  how much subtlety there can be in the apparently straightforward,  binary distinction between ‘same’ and different’ – or between ‘affected’  and ‘unaffected’. In the real quantum theory, too, the prohibitions on  inter-universe communication and faster-than-light communication  are closely connected. There is a way – I think it is the only way – to meet simultaneously  the requirements that our fictional laws of physics be universal and  deterministic, and forbid faster-than-light and inter-universe communi- cation:  more universes . Imagine an uncountably infinite number of  them, initially all fungible. The transporter causes previously fungible  ones to become different, as before; but now the relevant law of physics  says, ‘The voltage surges in  half the universes  in which the transporter  is used.’ So, if the two starships both run their transporters, then, after  the two spheres of differentiation have overlapped, there will be  universes of four different kinds: those in which a surge happened only  in the first starship, only in the second, in neither, and in both. In other  words, in the overlap region there are four different histories, each  taking place in one quarter of the universes. Our fictional theory has not provided enough structure in its multi- verse to give a meaning to ‘half the universes’, but the real quantum  277 The Multiverse theory does. As I explained in Chapter 8, the method that a theory  provides for giving a meaning to proportions and averages for infinite  sets is called a  measure . A familiar example is that classical physics  assigns  lengths  to infinite sets of points arranged in a line .  Let us suppose  that our theory provides a measure for universes. Now we are allowed storylines such as the following. In the universes  in which the couple married, they spend their honeymoon on a human- colonized planet that the starship is visiting. As they are teleporting  back up, the voltage surge in  half  those universes causes someone’s  electronic notepad to play a voice message suggesting that one of the  newlyweds has already been unfaithful. This sets off a chain of events  that ends in divorce. So now our original collection of fungible universes  contains three======================================================== constantly squabbling among yourselves about what qualities  constitute virtue or vice, and what actions are right or wrong? socrates:  Why is that puzzling? We disagree because it is easy to be  mistaken. Yet, despite that, we also  agree  about many such issues.  230 the beginning of infinity From this I speculate that, where we have so far failed to agree, it  is not because anything is actively deceiving us, but simply because  some issues are hard to reason about – just as there are many truths  in geometry that even Pythagoras did not know but which future  geometers may discover. As that other ‘wise mortal’ Xenophanes  wrote: The gods did not reveal, from the beginning,   All things to us; but in the course of time,  Through seeking we may learn and know things better.*   That is what we Athenians have done in regard to moral knowledge.  Through seeking we have learned, and agreed upon, the easy things.  And in future, by the same means – namely by refusing to hold any  of our ideas immune from criticism – we may learn some matters  not so light. hermes:  There is much truth in what you say. So, take it a little  further: if it is so hard to be systematically deceived on moral issues,  how is it that the Spartans disagree with you about some of those  issues on which nearly all Athenians agree – the ones that you have  just said are the  easy  ones?  socrates:  Because the Spartans learn many mistaken beliefs and  values in early childhood. hermes:  Whereas Athenians begin their flawless education at what  age?  socrates:  Again, you catch me in an error. Yes of course we too teach  our values to our young, and those must include our most serious  misconceptions as well as our deepest wisdom. Yet our values include  being open to suggestions, tolerant of dissent, and critical of both  dissent  and  received opinion. So I suppose that the real difference  between the Spartans and us is that their moral education enjoins  them to hold their most important ideas immune from criticism.  Not  to be open to suggestions.  Not  to criticize certain ideas such as  their traditions or their conceptions of the gods;  not  to seek the  truth, because they claim that they already have it.      Hence they do not believe that ‘in the course of time they may  *Popper’s translation in  The World of Parmenides  (1998). 231 A Dream of Socrates learn and know things better.’ They agree among themselves because  their laws and customs enforce conformity.  We  agree among ourselves  (to the extent that we do) because, through our tradition of endless  critical debate, we have discovered some genuine knowledge. Since  there is only one truth of any given matter, as we discover ideas closer  to the truth our ideas become closer to each other’s, so we agree  more. People who converge upon the truth converge with each other.  hermes:  Indeed. socrates:  Moreover, since the Spartans never seek improvement, it  is not surprising that they never find it. We, in contrast, have sought  it – by constantly criticizing and debating and trying to correct our  ideas and behaviour. And thereby we are well placed to learn more  in the future.  hermes: It  follows, then, that it is  wrong  of the Spartans to educate  their children to hold their city’s ideas, laws and customs immune  from criticism.  socrates: I  thought you weren’t going to reveal moral truths! hermes: I  can’t help it if it follows logically from epistemology. But,  anyway, you already know this one. socrates: Yes, I do.  And I see what you are getting at. You are showing  me that there  are  such things as mirages and tricks in regard to moral  knowledge. Some of them are embedded in the Spartans’ traditional  moral choices. Their whole way of life misleads and traps them –  because one of their mistaken beliefs is that they must take no steps  to prevent their way of life from misleading and trapping them! hermes: Yes.  socrates:  Are there such traps embedded in  our  way of life? [ Frowns. ]  Of course, I think there aren’t – but I would think that, wouldn’t I?  As Xenophanes also wrote, it’s all too easy to attribute universal  truth to mere local appearances: The Ethiops say that their gods are flat-nosed and black While the Thracians say that theirs have blue eyes and red hair. Yet if cattle or horses or lions had hands and could draw  And could sculpture like men, then the horses would draw their gods Like horses, and cattle like cattle . . . 232 the beginning of infinity hermes: So  now you are imagining some Spartan Socrates who  considers  their  ways virtuous and yours decadent – socrates:  And who considers  us  to be stuck in a trap, since we shall  never willingly ‘correct’ ourselves by adopting Spartan ways. Yes. hermes:  But does this Spartan Socrates, if he exists, worry that the  Athenian Socrates may be right, and he wrong? Was there a Spartan  Xenophanes who suspected that the gods might not be as the Greeks  think they are? socrates:  Most======================================================== never goes wrong, requires no maintenance, and has unlimited memory  and unlimited time to run its program.  Our own brains are, likewise, computers which we can use to learn  about things beyond the physical world, including pure mathematical  abstractions. This ability to understand abstractions is an emergent  property of people which greatly puzzled the ancient Athenian philo- sopher Plato. He noticed that the theorems of geometry – such as  Pythagoras’ theorem – are about entities that are never experienced:  perfectly straight lines with no thickness, intersecting each other on a  perfect plane to make a perfect triangle. These are not possible objects  of any observation. And yet people knew about them – and not just  superficially: at the time, such knowledge was the deepest knowledge,  of anything, that human beings had ever had. Where did it come from?  Plato concluded that it – and all human knowledge – must come from  the supernatural. He was right that it could not have come from observation. But then  it could not have even if people  had  been able to observe perfect  triangles (as arguably they could today, using virtual reality). As I  explained in Chapter 1, empiricism has multiple fatal flaws. But it is  no mystery where our knowledge of abstractions comes from: it comes  from conjecture, like all our knowledge, and through criticism and  seeking good explanations. It is only empiricism that made it seem  plausible that knowledge outside science is inaccessible; and it is only  the justified-true-belief misconception that makes such knowledge seem  less ‘justified’ than scientific theories.  As I explained in Chapter 1, even in science, almost all rejected  120 the beginning of infinity theories are rejected for being bad explanations, without ever being  tested. Experimental testing is only one of many methods of criticism  used in science, and the Enlightenment has made progress by bringing  those other methods to bear in non-scientific fields too. The basic  reason that such progress is possible is that good explanations about  philo  sophical issues are as hard to find as in science – and criticism is  correspondingly effective. Moreover, experience does play a role in philosophy – only not the  role of experimental testing that it plays in science. Primarily, it provides  philosophical  problems . There would have been no philosophy of  science if the issue of how we can acquire knowledge of the physical  world had been unproblematic. There would be no such thing as  political philosophy if there had not first been a problem of how to  run societies. (To avoid misunderstanding, let me stress that experience  provides problems only by bringing already-existing ideas into conflict.  It does not, of course, provide theories.)  In the case of moral philosophy, the empiricist and justificationist  misconceptions are often expressed in the maxim that ‘you can’t derive  an  ought  from an  is ’ (a paraphrase of a remark by the Enlightenment  philosopher David Hume). It means that moral theories cannot be  deduced from factual knowledge. This has become conventional wis  - dom, and has resulted in a kind of dogmatic despair about morality:  ‘you can’t derive an  ought  from an  is , therefore morality cannot be  justified by reason’. That leaves only two options: either to embrace  unreason or to try living without ever making a moral judgement. Both  are liable to lead to morally wrong choices, just as embracing unreason  or never attempting to explain the physical world leads to factually  false theories (and not just ignorance). Certainly you can’t derive an  ought  from an  is , but you can’t derive  a  factual  theory from an  is  either. That is not what science does. The  growth of knowledge does not consist of finding ways to justify one’s  beliefs. It consists of finding good explanations. And, although factual  evidence and moral maxims are logically independent, factual and  moral  explanations  are not. Thus factual knowledge can be useful in  criticizing moral explanations.  For example, in the nineteenth century, if an American slave had  written a bestselling book, that event would not  logically  have ruled  121 The Reality of Abstractions out the proposition ‘Negroes are intended by Providence to be slaves.’  No experience could, because that is a philosophical theory. But it  might have ruined the explanation through which many people  understood that proposition. And if, as a result, such people had found  themselves unable to explain to their own satisfaction why it would  be Providential if that author were to be forced back into slavery, then  they might have questioned the account that they had formerly accepted  of what a black person really is, and what a person in general is – and  then a good person, a good society, and so on. Conversely, advocates of highly immoral doctrines almost invariably  believe associated factual falsehoods as well. For instance, ever since======================================================== few kilometres, making  it so dense that most of its matter has been transmuted into neutrons).  It is not known whether this hypothetical neutron analogue of chemistry  exists – nor whether it could exist if the laws of physics were slightly  98 the beginning of infinity different. Nor do we have any idea what other sorts of environment  permitting the emergence of life would exist under those variant    laws. (The idea that similar laws of physics can be expected to give  rise to similar environments is undermined by the very existence of    fine-tuning.) Nevertheless, regardless of whether the fine-tuning constitutes an  appearance of design or not, it does constitute a legitimate and significant  scientific problem, for the following reason. If the truth is that the  constants of nature are  not  fine-tuned to produce life after all, because  most slight variations in them do still permit life and intelligence to  evolve somehow, though in dramatically different types of environment,  then this would be an unexplained regularity in nature and hence a  problem for science to address. If the laws of physics  are  fine-tuned, as they seem to be, then  there are two possibilities: either those laws are the only ones to be  instantiated in reality (as universes) or there are other regions of reality  – parallel universes* – with different laws. In the former case, we must  expect there to be an explanation of why the laws are as they are. It  would either refer to the existence of life or not. If it did, that would  take us back to Paley’s problem: it would mean that the laws had the  ‘appearance of design’ for creating life, but  had not  evolved. Or the  explanation would not refer to the existence of life, in which case it  would leave unexplained why, if the laws are as they are for non-life- related reasons, they are fine-tuned to create life. If there are many parallel universes, each with its own laws of  physics, most of which do not permit life, then the idea would be that  the observed fine-tuning is only a matter of parochial perspective. It is  only in the universes that contain astrophysicists that anyone ever  wonders why the constants seem fine-tuned. This type of explanation  is known as ‘anthropic reasoning’. It is said to follow from a principle  known as the ‘weak anthropic principle’, though really no principle is  required: it is just logic. (The qualifier ‘weak’ is there because several  other anthropic principles have been proposed, which are more than  just logic, but they need not concern us here.) *These are not the ‘parallel universes’ of the  quantum  multiverse, which I shall describe  in Chapter 11. Those universes all obey the same laws of physics and are in constant  slight interaction with each other. They are also much less speculative. 99 Creation However, on closer examination, anthropic arguments never quite  finish the explanatory job. To see why, consider an argument due to  the physicist Dennis Sciama. Imagine that, at some time in the future, theoreticians have calculated,  for one of those constants of physics, the range of its values for which  there would be a reasonable probability that astrophysicists (of a  suitable kind) would emerge. Say that range is from 137 to 138. (No  doubt the real values will not be whole numbers, but let us keep it  simple.) They also calculate that the highest probability of astrophysicists  occurs at the midpoint of the range – when the constant is 137.5.  Next, experimentalists set out to measure the value of that constant  directly – in laboratories, or by astronomical observation, say. What  should they predict? Curiously enough, one immediate prediction from  the anthropic ex      planation is that the value will not be exactly 137.5.  For suppose that it were. By analogy, imagine that the bull’s-eye of a  dartboard represents the values that can produce astrophysicists. It  would be a mistake to predict that a typical dart that strikes the bull’s  eye will strike it at the exact centre. Likewise, in the overwhelming  majority of universes in which the measurement could take place  (because they contain astrophysicists), the constant would not take the  exactly optimal value for producing astrophysicists, nor be extremely  close to it, compared with the size of the bull’s-eye. So Sciama concludes that, if we did measure one of those constants  of physics, and found that it was extremely close to the optimum    value for producing astrophysicists, that would statistically refute, not  corroborate, the anthropic explanation for its value. Of course that  value  might  still be a coincidence, but if we were willing to accept  astronomically unlikely coincidences as explanations we should not  be puzzled by the fine-tuning in the first place – and we should tell  Paley that the watch on the heath  might  just have been formed  by chance. Furthermore, astrophysicists should be relatively unlikely in universes  whose conditions are so======================================================== thought to be achieved in part by  a system based on ‘mirror neurons’. These are neurons that fire when  an animal performs a given action, and also when the animal perceives  the same action being performed by another. These neurons have been  406 the beginning of infinity identified experimentally in animals that have the capacity to imitate.  Scientists who believe that human meme replication is a sophisticated  form of imitation tend to believe that mirror neurons are a key to  understanding all sorts of functions of the human mind. Unfortunately,  that cannot possibly be so. It is not known  why  parroting evolved. It is a fairly common adap- tation in birds, and may play more than one role. But, whatever the  reason, the important thing for present purposes is that parrots never  have a choice about which sounds to imitate, or about what constitutes  imitating them. A ringing doorbell and a barking dog may happen    to provide conditions that meet the inborn criterion that initiates  parroting behaviour, and, when they do, the parrot will always mimic  exactly the same aspects of them: their sounds. So, it resolves the infinite  ambiguity by making no choices. It does not occur to it to ignore the  dog under those conditions, or to imitate the wagging of its tail, because  it is incapable of conceiving of any other criterion for imitation than  the one built into its mirror-neuron system. It is devoid of creativity  and  relies  on its lack of creativity to replicate the sounds faithfully.  This is reminiscent of humans in static societies – except for a crucial  difference which I shall explain below. Now, imagine that a parrot had been present at Popper’s lectures,  and learned to parrot some of Popper’s favourite sentences. It would,  in a sense, have ‘imitated’ some of Popper’s ideas: in principle, an  interested student could later learn the ideas by listening to the parrot.  But the parrot would merely be transmitting those memes from one  place to another – which is no more than the air in the lecture theatre  does. The parrot could not be said to have acquired the memes, because  it would be reproducing only one of the countless behaviours that they  could produce. The parrot’s subsequent behaviour as a result of having  learned the sounds by heart – such as its responses to questions – would  not resemble Popper’s. The sound of the meme would be there, but its  meaning would not. And it is the meaning – the knowledge – that is  the replicator. The parrot is oblivious to the human meanings of the sounds that  it parrots. Had those lectures been not about philosophy but about  recipes for fried parrot, it would have been just as eager to quote from  them to anyone who would listen. But it is not  oblivious  to the content  407 The Evolution of Creativity of the sound – it is not like a mechanical recorder. Quite the contrary:  parrots neither record sounds indiscriminately nor replay them ran  - domly. Their inborn criteria do implicitly attribute meaning to sounds  that they hear; it is just that the meaning is always drawn from the  same, narrow set of possibilities: if the evolutionary function of par  - roting is, for instance, to create identifying calls, then every sound it  hears is either a potential identifying call or not. Apes are capable of recognizing a much larger set of possible  meanings. Some of them are so complex that aping has often been  misinterpreted as evidence of human-like understanding. For example,  when an ape learns a new method of cracking nuts by hitting them  with rocks, it does not then play the movements back blindly in a fixed  sequence like a parrot does. The movements required to crack the nut  are never the same twice: the ape has to  aim  the rock at the nut; it may  have to  chase  the nut and fetch it back if it rolls away; it has to keep  hitting it until it cracks, rather than a fixed number of times; and so  on. During some parts of the procedure the ape’s two hands must  cooperate, each performing a different sub-task. Before it can even  begin, it must be able to recognize a nut as being suitable for the  procedure; it must look for a rock and, again, recognize a suitable one.  Such activities may seem to depend on explanation – on understand-  ing how and why each action within the complex behaviour has to fit  in with the other actions in order to achieve the overall purpose. But  recent discoveries have revealed how apes are able to imitate such  behaviours without ever creating any explanatory knowledge. In a  remarkable series of observational and theoretical studies, the evo  - lutionary psychologist and animal-behaviour researcher Richard Byrne  has shown how they achieve this by a process that he calls  behaviour  parsing  (which is analogous to the grammatical analysis or ‘parsing’  of human speech or computer programs).  Humans and computers separate continuous streams of sounds or  characters into individual elements such as words, and
