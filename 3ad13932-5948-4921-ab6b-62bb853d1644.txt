======================================================== The reason this unit was chosen is historical, and we shall not go into it now. More massive particles are put higher up on the chart; we see that a neutron and a proton have almost the same mass. In vertical columns we have put the particles with the same electrical charge, all neutral objects in one column, all positively charged ones to the right of this one, and all negatively charged objects to the left. Particles are shown with a solid line and “resonances” with a dashed one. Several particles have been omitted from the table. These include the important zero-mass, zero-charge particles, the photon and the graviton, which do not fall into the baryon-meson- lepton classiﬁcation scheme, and also some of the newer resonances (K * ,  φ ,  η ). The antiparticles of the mesons are listed in the table, but the antiparticles of the leptons and baryons would have to be listed in another table which would look exactly like this one re- ﬂected on the zero-charge column. Although all of the particles ex- cept the electron, neutrino, photon, graviton, and proton are unstable, decay products have been shown only for the resonances. Strangeness assignments are not applicable for leptons, since they do not interact strongly with nuclei. All particles which are together with the neutrons and protons are called  baryons,  and the following ones exist: There is a “lambda,” with a mass of 1115 Mev, and three others, called sigmas, minus, 40 Six Easy Pieces 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:01 PM  Page 40 41 Basic Physics Table 2-2 Elementary Particles. 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:01 PM  Page 41 neutral, and plus, with several masses almost the same. There are groups or multiplets with almost the same mass, within 1 or 2 per- cent. Each particle in a multiplet has the same strangeness. The ﬁrst multiplet is the proton-neutron doublet, and then there is a singlet (the lambda), then the sigma triplet, and ﬁnally the xi doublet. Very recently, in 1961, even a few more particles were found. Or  are  they particles? They live so short a time, they disintegrate almost instan- taneously, as soon as they are formed, that we do not know whether they should be considered as new particles, or some kind of “reso- nance” interaction of a certain deﬁnite energy between the  Λ and π  products into which they disintegrate. In addition to the baryons the other particles which are involved in the nuclear interaction are called  mesons.  There are ﬁrst the pions, which come in three varieties, positive, negative, and neutral; they form another multiplet. We have also found some new things called K-mesons, and they occur as a doublet, K + and K 0 .  Also, every particle has its antiparticle, unless a particle  is its own  antipar- ticle. For example, the  π– and the  π+ are antiparticles, but the  π 0 is its own antiparticle. The K – and K + are antiparticles, and the K 0 and  .  In addition, in 1961 we also found some more mesons or maybe  mesons which disintegrate almost immediately. A thing called  ω which goes into three pions has a mass 780 on this scale, and somewhat less certain is an object which disintegrates into two pions. These particles, called mesons and baryons, and the antipar- ticles of the mesons are on the same chart, but the antiparticles of the baryons must be put on another chart, “reﬂected” through the charge-zero column. Just as Mendeléev’s chart was very good, except for the fact that there were a number of rare earth elements which were hanging out loose from it, so we have a number of things hanging out loose from this chart—particles which do not interact strongly in nuclei, have nothing to do with a nuclear interaction, and do not have a strong interaction (I mean the powerful kind of interaction of nu- clear energy). These are called leptons, and they are the following: K 0 42 Six Easy Pieces 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:01 PM  Page 42 there is the electron, which has a very small mass on this scale, only 0.510 Mev. Then there is that other, the  μ -meson, the muon, which has a mass much higher, 206 times as heavy as an electron. So far as we can tell, by all experiments so far, the difference between the electron and the muon is nothing but the mass. Everything works exactly the same for the muon as for the electron, except that one is heavier than the other. Why is there another one heavier; what is the use for it? We do not know. In addition, there is a lepton which is neutral, called a neutrino, and this particle has zero mass. In fact, it is now known that there are  two  different kinds of neutrinos, one related to electrons and the other related to muons. Finally, we have two other particles which do not interact strongly with the nuclear ones: one is a photon, and perhaps, if the ﬁeld of gravity also has a quantum-mechanical analog (a quantum theory of gravitation has not yet been worked out), then there will be a particle, a graviton, which will have zero mass. What is this======================================================== are many proteins, such as the proteins in muscle, the structural pro- teins which are, for example, in cartilage and hair, skin, etc., that are not themselves enzymes. However, proteins are a very charac- teristic substance of life: ﬁrst of all they make up all the enzymes, and second, they make up much of the rest of living material. Pro- teins have a very interesting and simple structure. They are a series, or chain, of different  amino acids.  There are twenty different amino acids, and they all can combine with each other to form chains in which the backbone is CO-NH, etc. Proteins are nothing but chains of various ones of these twenty amino acids. Each of the amino acids probably serves some special purpose. Some, for ex- ample, have a sulfur atom at a certain place; when two sulfur atoms are in the same protein, they form a bond, that is, they tie the chain together at two points and form a loop. Another has extra oxygen atoms which make it an acidic substance; another has a basic char- acteristic. Some of them have big groups hanging out to one side, so that they take up a lot of space. One of the amino acids, called proline, is not really an amino acid, but imino acid. There is a slight 55 The Relation of Physics to Other Sciences 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:01 PM  Page 55 difference, with the result that when proline is in the chain, there is a kink in the chain. If we wished to manufacture a particular pro- tein, we would give these instructions: put one of those sulfur hooks here; next, add something to take up space; then attach something to put a kink in the chain. In this way, we will get a complicated- looking chain, hooked together and having some complex struc- ture; this is presumably just the manner in which all the various enzymes are made. One of the great triumphs in recent times (since 1960) was at last to discover the exact spatial atomic arrangement of certain proteins, which involve some ﬁfty-six or sixty amino acids in a row. Over a thousand atoms (more nearly two thousand, if we count the hydrogen atoms) have been located in a complex pattern in two proteins. The ﬁrst was hemoglobin. One of the sad aspects of this discovery is that we cannot see anything from the pattern; we do not understand why it works the way it does. Of course, that is the next problem to be attacked. Another problem is how do the enzymes know what to be? A red-eyed ﬂy makes a red-eyed ﬂy baby, and so the information for the whole pattern of enzymes to make red pigment must be passed from one ﬂy to the next. This is done by a substance in the nucleus of the cell, not a protein, called DNA (short for deoxyribonucleic acid). This is the key substance which is passed from one cell to an- other (for instance, sperm cells consist mostly of DNA) and carries the information as to how to make the enzymes. DNA is the “blue- print.” What does the blueprint look like and how does it work? First, the blueprint must be able to reproduce itself. Secondly, it must be able to instruct the protein. Concerning the reproduction, we might think that this proceeds like cell reproduction. Cells sim- ply grow bigger and then divide in half. Must it be thus with DNA molecules, then, that they too grow bigger and divide in half? Every atom  certainly does not grow bigger and divide in half! No, it is impossible to reproduce a molecule except by some more clever way. The structure of the substance DNA was studied for a long time, ﬁrst  chemically to ﬁnd the composition, and then with x-rays 56 Six Easy Pieces 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:01 PM  Page 56 to ﬁnd the pattern in space. The result was the following remark- able discovery: The DNA molecule is a pair of chains, twisted upon each other. The backbone of each of these chains, which are analogous to the chains of proteins but chemically quite different, is a series of sugar and phosphate groups, as shown in Fig. 3-2. Now we see how the chain can contain instructions, for if we could split this chain down the middle, we would have a series BAADC . . . and every living thing could have a different series. Thus perhaps, in some way, the speciﬁc  instructions  for the man- ufacture of proteins are contained in the speciﬁc  series  of the DNA. Attached to each sugar along the line, and linking the two chains together, are certain pairs of cross-links. However, they are not all of the same kind; there are four kinds, called adenine, thymine, cy- tosine, and guanine, but let us call them  A, B, C,  and  D . The in- teresting thing is that only certain pairs can sit opposite each other, for example  A  with  B  and   C  with  D.  These pairs are put on the two chains in such a way that they “ﬁt together,” and have a strong en- ergy of interaction. However,  C  will not ﬁt with  A,  and  B  will not ﬁt with   C  ; they will only ﬁt in pairs,  A  against  B  and  C  against  D . Therefore if one is   C  , the other must be  D , etc. Whatever the letters may be in======================================================== Gravitation Figure 5-12 The formation of new stars? 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:01 PM  Page 107 Why can we use mathematics to describe nature without a mech- anism behind it? No one knows. We have to keep going because we ﬁnd out more that way. Many mechanisms for gravitation have been suggested. It is in- teresting to consider one of these, which many people have thought of from time to time. At ﬁrst, one is quite excited and happy when he “discovers” it, but he soon ﬁnds that it is not correct. It was ﬁrst discovered about 1750. Suppose there were many particles moving in space at a very high speed in all directions and being only slightly absorbed in going through matter. When they  are  absorbed, they give an impulse to the earth. However, since there are as many going one way as another, the impulses all balance. But when the sun is nearby, the particles coming toward the earth through the sun are partially absorbed, so fewer of them are coming from the sun than are coming from the other side. Therefore, the earth feels a net impulse toward the sun and it does not take one long to see that it is inversely proportional to the square of the distance—because of the variation of the solid angle that the sun subtends as we vary the distance. What is wrong with that machinery? It involves some new consequences which are  not true.  This particular idea has the fol- 108 Six Easy Pieces Figure 5-13 A simplified diagram of the apparatus used by Cavendish to verify the law of universal gravitation for small objects and to measure the gravitational constant   G  .  0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:01 PM  Page 108 lowing trouble: the earth, in moving around the sun, would im- pinge on more particles which are coming from its forward side than from its hind side (when you run in the rain, the rain in your face is stronger than that on the back of your head!). Therefore there would be more impulse given the earth from the front, and the earth would feel a  resistance to motion  and would be slowing up in its orbit. One can calculate how long it would take for the earth to stop as a result of this resistance, and it would not take long enough for the earth to still be in its orbit, so this mechanism does not work. No machinery has ever been invented that “explains” gravity without also predicting some other phenomenon that does not  exist. Next we shall discuss the possible relation of gravitation to other forces. There is no explanation of gravitation in terms of other forces at the present time. It is not an aspect of electricity or any- thing like that, so we have no explanation. However, gravitation and other forces are very similar, and it is interesting to note analo- gies. For example, the force of electricity between two charged ob- jects looks just like the law of gravitation: the force of electricity is a constant, with a minus sign, times the product of the charges, and varies inversely as the square of the distance. It is in the oppo- site direction—likes repel. But is it still not very remarkable that the two laws involve the same function of distance? Perhaps gravi- tation and electricity are much more closely related than we think. Many attempts have been made to unify them; the so-called uniﬁed ﬁeld theory is only a very elegant attempt to combine electricity and gravitation; but, in comparing gravitation and electricity, the most interesting thing is the  relative strengths  of the forces. Any theory that contains them both must also deduce how strong the gravity is. If we take, in some natural units, the repulsion of two electrons (nature’s universal charge) due to electricity, and the attraction of two electrons due to their masses, we can measure the ratio of elec- trical repulsion to the gravitational attraction. The ratio is indepen- dent of the distance and is a fundamental constant of nature. The 109 The Theory of Gravitation 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:01 PM  Page 109 ratio is shown in Fig. 5-14. The gravitational attraction relative to the electrical repulsion between two electrons is 1 divided by 4.17 ¥ 10 42 ! The question is, where does such a large number come from? It is not accidental, like the ratio of the volume of the earth to the volume of a ﬂea. We have considered two natural aspects of the same thing, an electron. This fantastic number is a natural con- stant, so it involves something deep in nature. Where could such a tremendous number come from? Some say that we shall one day ﬁnd the “universal equation,” and in it, one of the roots will be this number. It is very difficult to ﬁnd an equation for which such a fantastic number is a natural root. Other possibilities have been thought of; one is to relate it to the age of the universe. Clearly, we have to ﬁnd  another  large number somewhere. But do we mean the age of the universe in  years?  No, because years are not “natural”; they were devised by men. As an example of something natural, let us======================================================== this membrane has an interesting property; if it “discharges” in one place, i.e., if some of the ions were able to move through one place, so that the electric voltage is reduced there, that electrical inﬂuence makes itself felt on the ions in the neighborhood, and it affects the membrane in such a way that it lets the ions through at neighboring points also. This in turn affects it farther along, etc., and so there is a wave of “pen- etrability” of the membrane which runs down the ﬁber when it is “excited” at one end by stepping on the sharp stone. This wave is somewhat analogous to a long sequence of vertical dominoes; if the end one is pushed over, that one pushes the next, etc. Of course this will transmit only one message unless the dominoes are set up again; and similarly in the nerve cell, there are processes which pump the ions slowly out again, to get the nerve ready for the next impulse. So it is that we know what we are doing (or at least where we are). Of course the electrical effects associated with 50 Six Easy Pieces 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:01 PM  Page 50 this nerve impulse can be picked up with electrical instruments, and because there  are  electrical effects, obviously the physics of electrical effects has had a great deal of inﬂuence on understand- ing the phenomenon. The opposite effect is that, from somewhere in the brain, a mes- sage is sent out along a nerve. What happens at the end of the nerve? There the nerve branches out into ﬁne little things, con- nected to a structure near a muscle, called an endplate. For reasons which are not exactly understood, when the impulse reaches the end of the nerve, little packets of a chemical called acetylcholine are shot off (ﬁve or ten molecules at a time) and they affect the muscle ﬁber and make it contract—how simple! What makes a muscle contract? A muscle is a very large number of ﬁbers close to- gether, containing two different substances, myosin and acto- myosin, but the machinery by which the chemical reaction induced by acetylcholine can modify the dimensions of the muscle is not yet known. Thus the fundamental processes in the muscle that make mechanical motions are not known. Biology is such an enormously wide ﬁeld that there are hosts of other problems that we cannot mention at all—problems on how vision works (what the light does in the eye), how hearing works, etc. (The way in which  thinking  works we shall discuss later under psychology.) Now, these things concerning biology which we have just discussed are, from a biological standpoint, really not funda- mental, at the bottom of life, in the sense that even if we under- stood them we still would not understand life itself. To illustrate: the men who study nerves feel their work is very important, because after all you cannot have animals without nerves. But you  can  have life  without nerves. Plants have neither nerves nor muscles, but they are working, they are alive, just the same. So for the fundamental problems of biology we must look deeper; when we do, we discover that all living things have a great many characteristics in common. The most common feature is that they are made of  cells,  within each of which is complex machinery for doing things chemically. 51 The Relation of Physics to Other Sciences 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:01 PM  Page 51 In plant cells, for example, there is machinery for picking up light and generating sucrose, which is consumed in the dark to keep the plant alive. When the plant is eaten the sucrose itself generates in the animal a series of chemical reactions very closely related to pho- tosynthesis (and its opposite effect in the dark) in plants. In the cells of living systems there are many elaborate chemical reactions, in which one compound is changed into another and another. To give some impression of the enormous efforts that have gone into the study of biochemistry, the chart in Fig. 3-1 summarizes our knowledge to date on just one small part of the many series of reactions which occur in cells, perhaps a percent or so of it. Here we see a whole series of molecules which change from one to another in a sequence or cycle of rather small steps. It is called the Krebs cycle, the respiratory cycle. Each of the chemicals and each of the steps is fairly simple, in terms of what change is made in the molecule, but—and this is a centrally important discovery in biochemistry—these changes are  relatively difficult to accomplish in a laboratory.  If we have one substance and another very similar substance, the one does not just turn into the other, because the two forms are usually separated by an energy barrier or “hill.” Con- sider this analogy: If we wanted to take an object from one place to another, at the same level but on the other side of a hill, we could push it over the top, but to do so requires the addition of some en- ergy. Thus most chemical reactions do not occur, because there is what is called an  activation======================================================== basic laws of physics, the conservation of energy. There is a fact, or if you wish, a  law,  governing all natural phe- nomena that are known to date. There is no known exception to this law—it is exact so far as we know. The law is called the  conser- vation of energy.  It states that there is a certain quantity, which we call energy, that does not change in the manifold changes which nature undergoes. That is a most abstract idea, because it is a math- ematical principle; it says that there is a numerical quantity which does not change when something happens. It is not a description of a mechanism, or anything concrete; it is just a strange fact that we can calculate some number and when we ﬁnish watching nature go through her tricks and calculate the number again, it is the same. (Something like the bishop on a red square, and after a number of moves—details unknown—it is still on some red square. It is a law 69 4 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:01 PM  Page 69 of this nature.) Since it is an abstract idea, we shall illustrate the meaning of it by an analogy. Imagine a child, perhaps “Dennis the Menace,” who has blocks which are absolutely indestructible, and cannot be divided into pieces. Each is the same as the other. Let us suppose that he has 28 blocks. His mother puts him with his 28 blocks into a room at the beginning of the day. At the end of the day, being curious, she counts the blocks very carefully, and discovers a phenomenal law— no matter what he does with the blocks, there are always 28 re- maining! This continues for a number of days, until one day there are only 27 blocks, but a little investigating shows that there is one under the rug—she must look everywhere to be sure that the num- ber of blocks has not changed. One day, however, the number ap- pears to change—there are only 26 blocks. Careful investigation indicates that the window was open, and upon looking outside, the other two blocks are found. Another day, careful count indicates that there are 30 blocks! This causes considerable consternation, until it is realized that Bruce came to visit, bringing his blocks with him, and he left a few at Dennis’s house. After she has disposed of the extra blocks, she closes the window, does not let Bruce in, and then everything is going along all right, until one time she counts and ﬁnds only 25 blocks. However, there is a box in the room, a toy box, and the mother goes to open the toy box, but the boy says, “No, do not open my toy box,” and screams. Mother is not allowed to open the toy box. Being extremely curious, and somewhat in- genious, she invents a scheme! She knows that a block weighs three ounces, so she weighs the box at a time when she sees 28 blocks, and it weighs 16 ounces. The next time she wishes to check, she weighs the box again, subtracts 16 ounces, and divides by 3. She discovers the following: (4.1) number of blocksseen 3ounces (weightof box) 16ounces constant. = + - cm 70 Six Easy Pieces 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:01 PM  Page 70 There then appear to be some new deviations, but careful study indicates that the dirty water in the bathtub is changing its level. The child is throwing blocks into the water, and she cannot see them because it is so dirty, but she can ﬁnd out how many blocks are in the water by adding another term to her formula. Since the original height of the water was 6 inches and each block raises the water a quarter of an inch, this new formula would be: (4.2) constant. += number of blocksseen 3ounces (weightof box) 16ounces 1/4inch (heightof water) 6inches + - - cm 71 Conservation of Energy In the gradual increase in the complexity of her world, she ﬁnds a whole series of terms representing ways of calculating how many blocks are in places where she is not allowed to look. As a result, she ﬁnds a complex formula, a quantity which  has to be computed, which always stays the same in her situation. What is the analogy of this to the conservation of energy? The most remarkable aspect that must be abstracted from this picture is that  there are no blocks.  Take away the ﬁrst terms in (4.1) and (4.2) and we ﬁnd ourselves calculating more or less abstract things. The analogy has the following points: First, when we are calculating the energy, sometimes some of it leaves the system and goes away, or sometimes some comes in. In order to verify the conservation of energy, we must be careful that we have not put any in or taken any out. Second, the energy has a large number of  different forms, and there is a formula for each one. These are gravitational energy, kinetic energy, heat energy, elastic energy, electrical energy, chemical energy, radiant energy, nuclear energy, mass energy. If we total up the formulas for each of these contributions, it will not change ex- cept for energy going in and out. It is important to realize that in physics today, we have no knowl- edge of what energy  is.  We do not have a picture that energy comes======================================================== this membrane has an interesting property; if it “discharges” in one place, i.e., if some of the ions were able to move through one place, so that the electric voltage is reduced there, that electrical inﬂuence makes itself felt on the ions in the neighborhood, and it affects the membrane in such a way that it lets the ions through at neighboring points also.

The quantum-mechanical aspects of nature have not yet been carried over to gravitation. When the scale is so small that we need the quantum effects, the gravitational effects are so weak that the need for a quantum theory of gravitation has not yet developed. On the other hand, for consistency in our physical theories it would be important to see whether Newton’s law mod- iﬁed to Einstein’s law can be further modiﬁed to be consistent with the uncertainty principle. This last modiﬁcation has not yet been completed. 113 The Theory of Gravitation 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:01 PM  Page 113 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:01 PM  Page 114 QUANTUM BEHAVIOR Atomic mechanics In the last few chapters we have treated the essential ideas nec- essary for an understanding of most of the important phenom- ena of light—or electromagnetic radiation in general. (We have left a few special topics for next year. Speciﬁcally, the theory of the index of dense materials and total internal reﬂection.) What we have dealt with is called the “classical theory” of electric waves, which turns out to be a completely adequate description of nature for a large number of effects. We have not had to worry yet about the fact that light energy comes in lumps or “photons.” We would like to take up as our next subject the problem of the behavior of relatively large pieces of matter—their mechanical and thermal properties, for instance. In discussing these, we will ﬁnd that the “classical” (or older) theory fails almost immediately, be- cause matter is really made up of atomic-sized particles. Still, we will deal only with the classical part, because that is the only part that we can understand using the classical mechanics we have been learning. But we shall not be very successful. We shall ﬁnd that in the case of matter, unlike the case of light, we shall be in difficulty relatively soon. We could, of course, continuously skirt away from the atomic effects, but we shall instead interpose here a short ex- cursion in which we will describe the basic ideas of the quantum properties of matter, i.e., the quantum ideas of atomic physics, so 115 6 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:01 PM  Page 115 that you will have some feeling for what it is we are leaving out. For we will have to leave out some important subjects that we can- not avoid coming close to. So we will give now the  introduction  to the subject of quantum mechanics, but will not be able actually to get into the subject until much later. “Quantum mechanics” is the description of the behavior of mat- ter in all its details and, in particular, of the happenings on an atomic scale. Things on a very small scale behave like nothing that you have any direct experience about. They do not behave like waves, they do not behave like particles, they do not behave like clouds, or billiard balls, or weights on springs, or like anything that you have ever seen. Newton thought that light was made up of particles, but then it was discovered, as we have seen here, that it behaves like a wave. Later, however (in the beginning of the twentieth century), it was found that light did indeed sometimes behave like a particle. His- torically, the electron, for example, was thought to behave like a particle, and then it was found that in many respects it behaved like a wave. So it really behaves like neither. Now we have given up. We say: “It is like  neither .” There is one lucky break, however—electrons behave just like light. The quantum behavior of atomic objects (electrons, pro- tons, neutrons, photons, and so on) is the same for all; they are all “particle waves,” or whatever you want to call them. So what we learn about the properties of electrons (which we shall use for our examples) will apply also to all “particles,” including photons of light. The gradual accumulation of information about atomic and small-scale behavior during the ﬁrst quarter of this century, which gave some indications about how small things do behave, produced an increasing confusion which was ﬁnally resolved in 1926 and 1927 by Schrödinger, Heisenberg, and Born. They ﬁnally obtained a consistent description of the behavior of matter on a small scale. We take up the main features of that description in this chapter. 116 Six Easy Pieces 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:01 PM  Page 116 Because atomic behavior is so unlike ordinary experience, it is very difficult to get used to and it appears peculiar and mysterious to everyone, both to the novice and to the experienced physicist. Even the experts do not understand it the way they would like to, and it is perfectly reasonable that they should not, because======================================================== nothing like  things on a large scale. That is what makes physics difficult—and very interesting. It is hard because the way things behave on a small scale is so “unnat- ural”; we have no direct experience with it. Here things behave like nothing we know of, so that it is impossible to describe this behav- ior in any other than analytic ways. It is difficult, and takes a lot of imagination. Quantum mechanics has many aspects. In the ﬁrst place, the 33 Basic Physics 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:01 PM  Page 33 idea that a particle has a deﬁnite location and a deﬁnite speed is no longer allowed; that is wrong. To give an example of how wrong clas- sical physics is, there is a rule in quantum mechanics that says that one cannot know both where something is  and how fast it is moving. The uncertainty of the momentum and the uncertainty of the posi- tion are complementary, and the product of the two is bounded by a small constant. We can write the law like this:  , but we shall explain it in more detail later. This rule is the explanation of a very mysterious paradox: If the atoms are made out of plus and minus charges, why don’t the minus charges simply sit on top of the plus charges (they attract each other) and get so close as to com- pletely cancel them out?  Why are atoms so big?  Why is the nucleus at the center with the electrons around it? It was ﬁrst thought that this was because the nucleus was so big; but no, the nucleus is  very small.  An atom has a diameter of about 10 –8 cm. The nucleus has a diameter of about 10 –13 cm. If we had an atom and wished to see the nucleus, we would have to magnify it until the whole atom was the size of a large room, and then the nucleus would be a bare speck which you could just about make out with the eye, but very nearly all the weight  of the atom is in that inﬁnitesimal  nucleus.  What keeps the electrons from simply falling in? This principle: If they were in the nucleus, we would know their position precisely, and the uncer- tainty principle would then require that they have a very  large  (but uncertain) momentum, i.e., a very large  kinetic energy.  With this en- ergy they would break away from the nucleus. They make a com- promise: they leave themselves a little room for this uncertainty and then jiggle with a certain amount of minimum motion in accor- dance with this rule. (Remember that when a crystal is cooled to absolute zero, we said that the atoms do not stop moving, they still jiggle. Why? If they stopped moving, we would know where they were and that they had zero motion, and that is against the uncer- tainty principle. We cannot know where they are and how fast they are moving, so they must be continually wiggling in there!) Another most interesting change in the ideas and philosophy / xp 2 ' $ DD 34 Six Easy Pieces 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:01 PM  Page 34 of science brought about by quantum mechanics is this: it is not possible to predict  exactly  what will happen in any circumstance. For example, it is possible to arrange an atom which is ready to emit light, and we can measure when it has emitted light by pick- ing up a photon particle, which we shall describe shortly. We can- not, however, predict  when  it is going to emit the light or, with several atoms,  which one  is going to. You may say that this is be- cause there are some internal “wheels” which we have not looked at closely enough. No, there  are  no internal wheels; nature, as we understand it today, behaves in such a way that it is  fundamentally impossible  to make a precise prediction of  exactly what will happen in a given experiment. This is a horrible thing; in fact, philosophers have said before that one of the fundamental requisites of science is that whenever you set up the same conditions, the same thing must happen. This is simply  not true;  it is  not  a fundamental con- dition of science. The fact is that the same thing does not happen, that we can ﬁnd only an average, statistically, as to what happens. Nevertheless, science has not completely collapsed. Philosophers, incidentally, say a great deal about what is  absolutely necessary  for science, and it is always, so far as one can see, rather naive, and probably wrong. For example, some philosopher or other said it is fundamental to the scientiﬁc effort that if an experiment is per- formed in, say, Stockholm, and then the same experiment is done in, say, Quito, the  same results  must occur. That is quite false. It is not necessary that  science  do that; it may be a  fact of experience,  but it is not necessary. For example, if one of the experiments is to look out at the sky and see the aurora borealis in Stockholm, you do not see it in Quito; that is a different phenomenon. “But,” you say, “that is something that has to do with the outside; can you close yourself up in a box in Stockholm and pull down the shade and get any difference?” Surely. If we take a pendulum on a uni- versal joint,======================================================== and pull it out and let go, then the pendulum will swing almost in a plane, but not quite. Slowly the plane keeps changing in Stockholm, but not in Quito. The blinds are down, 35 Basic Physics 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:01 PM  Page 35 too. The fact that this happened does not bring on the destruction of science. What  is  the fundamental hypothesis of science, the fundamental philosophy? We stated it in the ﬁrst chapter:  the sole test of the validity of any idea is experiment.  If it turns out that most experiments work out the same in Quito as they do in Stockholm, then those “most experiments” will be used to formulate some general law, and those experiments which do not come out the same we will say were a result of the environment near Stockholm. We will invent some way to summarize the results of the experi- ment, and we do not have to be told ahead of time what this way will look like. If we are told that the same experiment will always produce the same result, that is all very well, but if when we try it, it does  not,  then it does  not.  We just have to take what we see, and then formulate all the rest of our ideas in terms of our actual experience. Returning again to quantum mechanics and fundamental physics, we cannot go into details of the quantum-mechanical principles at this time, of course, because these are rather difficult to understand. We shall assume that they are there, and go on to describe what some of the consequences are. One of the conse- quences is that things which we used to consider as waves also behave like particles, and particles behave like waves; in fact everything behaves the same way. There is no distinction between a wave and a particle. So quantum mechanics  uniﬁes  the idea of the ﬁeld and its waves, and the particles, all into one. Now it is true that when the frequency is low, the ﬁeld aspect of the phe- nomenon is more evident, or more useful as an approximate de- scription in terms of everyday experiences. But as the frequency increases, the particle aspects of the phenomenon become more evident with the equipment with which we usually make the mea- surements. In fact, although we mentioned many frequencies, no phenomenon directly involving a frequency has yet been detected above approximately 10 12 cycles per second. We only  deduce  the higher frequencies from the energy of the particles, by a rule 36 Six Easy Pieces 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:01 PM  Page 36 which assumes that the particle-wave idea of quantum mechanics is valid. Thus we have a new view of electromagnetic interaction. We have a new kind of  particle  to add to the electron, the proton, and the neutron. That new particle is called a  photon.  The new view of the interaction of electrons and photons that is electromagnetic theory, but with everything quantum-mechanically correct, is called quantum electrodynamics.  This fundamental theory of the interac- tion of light and matter, or electric ﬁeld and charges, is our greatest success so far in physics. In this one theory we have the basic rules for all ordinary phenomena except for gravitation and nuclear pro- cesses. For example, out of quantum electrodynamics come all known electrical, mechanical, and chemical laws: the laws for the collision of billiard balls, the motions of wires in magnetic ﬁelds, the speciﬁc heat of carbon monoxide, the color of neon signs, the density of salt, and the reactions of hydrogen and oxygen to make water are all consequences of this one law. All these details can be worked out if the situation is simple enough for us to make an ap- proximation, which is almost never, but often we can understand more or less what is happening. At the present time no exceptions are found to the quantum-electrodynamic laws outside the nucleus, and there we do not know whether there is an exception because we simply do not know what is going on in the nucleus. In principle, then, quantum electrodynamics is the theory of all chemistry, and of life, if life is ultimately reduced to chemistry and therefore just to physics because chemistry is already reduced (the part of physics which is involved in chemistry being already known). Furthermore, the same quantum electrodynamics, this great thing, predicts a lot of new things. In the ﬁrst place, it tells the properties of very high-energy photons, gamma rays, etc. It predicted another very remarkable thing: besides the electron, there should be another particle of the same mass, but of opposite charge, called a  positron,  and these two, coming together, could annihilate each other with the emission of light or gamma rays. 37 Basic Physics 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:01 PM  Page 37 (After all, light and gamma rays are all the same; they are just dif- ferent points on a frequency scale.) The generalization of this, that for each particle there is an antiparticle, turns out to be true. In the case of electrons, the antiparticle has another name—it is======================================================== they work in all possible circumstances, as we do in Euclidean geometry, where we 1 1 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:00 PM  Page 1 state the axioms and then make all sorts of deductions. (So, not satisﬁed to learn physics in four years, you want to learn it in four minutes?) We cannot do it in this way for two reasons. First, we do not yet  know  all the basic laws: there is an expanding frontier of ignorance. Second, the correct statement of the laws of physics involves some very unfamiliar ideas which require advanced math- ematics for their description. Therefore, one needs a considerable amount of preparatory training even to learn what the  words  mean. No, it is not possible to do it that way. We can only do it piece by piece. Each piece, or part, of the whole of nature is always merely an approximation  to the complete truth, or the complete truth so far as we know it. In fact, everything we know is only some kind of approximation, because  we know that we do not know all the laws as yet. Therefore, things must be learned only to be unlearned again or, more likely, to be corrected. The principle of science, the deﬁnition, almost, is the follow- ing:  The test of all knowledge is experiment.  Experiment is the  sole judge  of scientiﬁc “truth.” But what is the source of knowledge? Where do the laws that are to be tested come from? Experiment, itself, helps to produce these laws, in the sense that it gives us hints. But also needed is  imagination  to create from these hints the great generalizations—to guess at the wonderful, simple, but very strange patterns beneath them all, and then to experiment to check again whether we have made the right guess. This imagining process is so difficult that there is a division of labor in physics: there are  the- oretical  physicists who imagine, deduce, and guess at new laws, but do not experiment; and then there are  experimental  physicists who experiment, imagine, deduce, and guess. We said that the laws of nature are approximate: that we ﬁrst ﬁnd the “wrong” ones, and then we ﬁnd the “right” ones. Now, how can an experiment be “wrong”? First, in a trivial way: if some- thing is wrong with the apparatus that you did not notice. But these things are easily ﬁxed, and checked back and forth. So without 2 Six Easy Pieces 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:00 PM  Page 2 snatching at such minor things, how  can  the results of an experi- ment be wrong? Only by being inaccurate. For example, the mass of an object never seems to change: a spinning top has the same weight as a still one. So a “law” was invented: mass is constant, in- dependent of speed. That “law” is now found to be incorrect. Mass is found to increase with velocity, but appreciable increases require velocities near that of light. A  true  law is: if an object moves with a speed of less than one hundred miles a second the mass is constant to within one part in a million. In some such approximate form this is a correct law. So in practice one might think that the new law makes no signiﬁcant difference. Well, yes and no. For ordinary speeds we can certainly forget it and use the simple constant-mass law as a good approximation. But for high speeds we are wrong, and the higher the speed, the more wrong we are. Finally, and most interesting,  philosophically we are completely wrong  with the approximate law. Our entire picture of the world has to be altered even though the mass changes only by a little bit. This is a very peculiar thing about the philosophy, or the ideas, be- hind the laws. Even a very small effect sometimes requires profound changes in our ideas. Now, what should we teach ﬁrst? Should we teach the  correct  but unfamiliar law with its strange and difficult conceptual ideas, for example the theory of relativity, four-dimensional space-time, and so on? Or should we ﬁrst teach the simple “constant-mass” law, which is only approximate, but does not involve such difficult ideas? The ﬁrst is more exciting, more wonderful, and more fun, but the second is easier to get at ﬁrst, and is a ﬁrst step to a real un- derstanding of the ﬁrst idea. This point arises again and again in teaching physics. At different times we shall have to resolve it in different ways, but at each stage it is worth learning what is now known, how accurate it is, how it ﬁts into everything else, and how it may be changed when we learn more. Let us now proceed with our outline, or general map, of our un- derstanding of science today (in particular, physics, but also of other 3 Atoms in Motion 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:00 PM  Page 3 sciences on the periphery), so that when we later concentrate on some particular point we will have some idea of the background, why that particular point is interesting, and how it ﬁts into the big structure. So, what  is  our overall picture of the world? Matter is made of atoms If, in some cataclysm, all of scientiﬁc knowledge were to be de- stroyed, and only one======================================================== through. This means that the center of our in- terference pattern will have a different location for each electron. The wiggles of the interference pattern will be smeared out. We shall show quantitatively in the next chapter that if we determine the momentum of the plate sufficiently accurately to determine from the recoil measurement which hole was used, then the uncer- tainty in the  x -position of the plate will, according to the uncer- tainty principle, be enough to shift the pattern observed at the 137 Quantum Behavior Figure 6-6 An experiment in which the recoil of the wall is measured . 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:01 PM  Page 137 detector up and down in the  x -direction about the distance from a maximum to its nearest minimum. Such a random shift is just enough to smear out the pattern so that no interference is observed. The uncertainty principle “protects” quantum mechanics. Heisenberg recognized that if it were possible to measure the mo- mentum and the position simultaneously with a greater accuracy, the quantum mechanics would collapse. So he proposed that it must be impossible. Then people sat down and tried to ﬁgure out ways of doing it, and nobody could ﬁgure out a way to measure the position and the momentum of anything—a screen, an elec- tron, a billiard ball, anything—with any greater accuracy. Quantum mechanics maintains its perilous but accurate existence. 138 Six Easy Pieces 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:01 PM  Page 138 INDEX 139 Acceleration, force, mass and, 89, 93 Acceleration toward the center of a circular path, 97f Acetylcholine, 51 Activation energy, 52 Actomyosin, 51 Adenine, 57 Air turbulent ﬂow, 62 water evaporation, 11–  13 ▶ -irone, 19f Amalgamation, classes of natural phenomena, 26–  27 Amino acids, 55, 57, 59 Angstrom (Å), 5 Angular momentum, 84, 85, 102 Antineutrons, 38 Antiparticles, 38, 42 Antiprotons, 38 Astronomy, physics and, 59–  61, 65 Atmospheric pressure, 6 Atomic bomb, 38 Atomic fact, 4 Atomic hypothesis, 4–  10 Atomic mechanics, quantum behavior, 115–  17 Atoms.

In quantum electrodynamics,  two numbers  are put in and most of the other numbers in the world are supposed to come out. The two numbers that are put in are called the mass of the electron and the charge of the electron. Ac- tually, that is not quite true, for we have a whole set of numbers for chemistry which tells how heavy the nuclei are. That leads us to the next part. Nuclei and particles What are the nuclei made of, and how are they held together? It is found that the nuclei are held together by enormous forces. When these are released, the energy released is tremendous compared with chemical energy, in the same ratio as the atomic bomb explosion is to a TNT explosion, because, of course, the atomic bomb has to do with changes inside the nucleus, while the explosion of TNT has to do with the changes of the electrons on the outside of the atoms. The question is, what are the forces which hold the protons and neutrons together in the nucleus? Just as the electrical interac- tion can be connected to a particle, a photon, Yukawa suggested that the forces between neutrons and protons also have a ﬁeld of some kind, and that when this ﬁeld jiggles it behaves like a particle. Thus there could be some other particles in the world besides pro- tons and neutrons, and he was able to deduce the properties of these particles from the already known characteristics of nuclear forces. For example, he predicted they should have a mass of two or three hundred times that of an electron; and lo and behold, in cosmic rays there was discovered a particle of the right mass! But it later turned out to be the wrong particle. It was called a  μ -meson, or muon. 38 Six Easy Pieces 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:01 PM  Page 38 However, a little while later, in 1947 or 1948, another particle was found, the  π -meson, or pion, which satisﬁed Yukawa’s criterion. Besides the proton and the neutron, then, in order to get nuclear forces we must add the pion. Now, you say, “Oh great!, with this theory we make quantum nucleodynamics using the pions just like Yukawa wanted to do, and see if it works, and everything will be explained.” Bad luck. It turns out that the calculations that are in- volved in this theory are so difficult that no one has ever been able to ﬁgure out what the consequences of the theory are, or to check it against experiment, and this has been going on now for almost twenty years! So we are stuck with a theory, and we do not know whether it is right or wrong, but we do know that it is a  little  wrong, or at least incomplete. While we have been dawdling around theoretically, trying to calculate the consequences of this theory, the experimen- talists have been discovering some things. For example, they had already discovered this  m -meson or muon, and we do not yet know where it ﬁts. Also, in cosmic rays, a large number of other “extra” particles were found. It turns out that today we have approximately thirty particles, and it is very difficult to understand the relation- ships of all these particles, and what nature wants them for, or what the connections are from one to another. We do not today under- stand these various particles as different aspects of the same thing, and the fact that we have so many unconnected particles is a rep- resentation of the fact that we have so much unconnected infor- mation without a good theory. After the great successes of quantum electrodynamics, there is a certain amount of knowledge of nuclear physics which is rough knowledge, sort of half experience and half theory, assuming a type of force between protons and neutrons and seeing what will happen, but not really understanding where the force comes from. Aside from that, we have made very little progress. We have collected an enormous number of chemical ele- ments. In the chemical case, there suddenly appeared a relationship among these elements which was unexpected, and which is embod- ied in the periodic table of Mendeléev. For example, sodium and 39 Basic Physics 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:01 PM  Page 39 potassium are about the same in their chemical properties and are found in the same column in the Mendeléev chart. We have been seeking a Mendeléev-type chart for the new particles. One such chart of the new particles was made independently by Gell-Mann in the USA and Nishijima in Japan. The basis of their classiﬁcation is a new number, like the electric charge, which can be assigned to each particle, called its “strangeness,”  S.  This number is conserved, like the electric charge, in reactions which take place by nuclear forces. In Table 2-2 are listed all the particles. We cannot discuss them much at this stage, but the table will at least show you how much we do not know. Underneath each particle its mass is given in a cer- tain unit, called the Mev. One Mev is equal to 1.782  ¥ 10 –27 gram.======================================================== Quantum physics 33 Nuclei and particles 38 THREE:The Relation of Physics to Other Sciences 47 Introduction 47 Chemistry 48 Biology 49 Astronomy 59 Geology 61 Psychology 63 How did it get that way? 64 v 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:00 PM  Page v FOUR: Conservation of Energy 69 What is energy? 69 Gravitational potential energy 72 Kinetic energy 80 Other forms of energy 81 FIVE:The Theory of Gravitation 89 Planetary motions 89 Kepler’s laws 90 Development of dynamics 92 Newton’s law of gravitation 94 Universal gravitation 98 Cavendish’s experiment 104 What is gravity? 107 Gravity and relativity 112 SIX: Quantum Behavior 115 Atomic mechanics 115 An experiment with bullets 117 An experiment with waves 120 An experiment with electrons 122 The interference of electron waves 124 Watching the electrons 127 First principles of quantum mechanics 133 The uncertainty principle 136 Index 139 vi Contents 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:00 PM  Page vi PUBLISHER’S  NOTE Six Easy Pieces  grew out of the need to bring to as wide an audience as possible a substantial yet nontechnical physics primer based on the science of Richard Feynman. We have chosen the six easiest chapters from Feynman’s celebrated and landmark text,  The Feyn- man Lectures on Physics  (originally published in 1963), which re- mains his most famous publication. General readers are fortunate that Feynman chose to present certain key topics in largely quali- tative terms without formal mathematics, and these are brought to- gether for  Six Easy Pieces. We would like to thank Paul Davies for his insightful introduc- tion to this newly formed collection. Following his introduction we have chosen to reproduce two prefaces from  The Feynman Lec- tures on Physics,  one by Feynman himself and one by two of his col- leagues, because they provide context for the pieces that follow and insight into both Richard Feynman and his science. Finally, we would like to thank the California Institute of Tech- nology’s Physics Department and Institute Archives, in particular Dr. Judith Goodstein, and Dr. Brian Hatﬁeld, for his outstanding advice and recommendations throughout the development of this project. vii 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:00 PM  Page vii 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:00 PM  Page viii ix INTRODUCTION There is a popular misconception that science is an impersonal, dispassionate, and thoroughly objective enterprise. Whereas most other human activities are dominated by fashions, fads, and per- sonalities, science is supposed to be constrained by agreed rules of procedure and rigorous tests. It is the results that count, not the people who produce them. This is, of course, manifest nonsense. Science is a people-driven activity like all human endeavor, and just as subject to fashion and whim. In this case fashion is set not so much by choice of subject matter, but by the way scientists think about the world. Each age adopts its particular approach to scientiﬁc problems, usually fol- lowing the trail blazed by certain dominant ﬁgures who both set the agenda and deﬁne the best methods to tackle it. Occasionally scientists attain sufficient stature that they become noticed by the general public, and when endowed with outstanding ﬂair a scientist may become an icon for the entire scientiﬁc community. In earlier centuries Isaac Newton was an icon. Newton personiﬁed the gen- tleman scientist—well connected, devoutly religious, unhurried, and methodical in his work. His style of doing science set the stan- dard for two hundred years. In the ﬁrst half of the twentieth cen- tury Albert Einstein replaced Newton as the popular scientist icon. Eccentric, dishevelled, Germanic, absent-minded, utterly absorbed in his work, and an archetypal abstract thinker, Einstein changed the way that physics is done by questioning the very concepts that deﬁne the subject. Richard Feynman has become an icon for late twentieth-century 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:00 PM  Page ix physics—the ﬁrst American to achieve this status. Born in New York in 1918 and educated on the East Coast, he was too late to participate in the Golden Age of physics, which, in the ﬁrst three decades of this century, transformed our worldview with the twin revolutions of the theory of relativity and quantum mechanics. These sweeping developments laid the foundations of the ediﬁce we now call the New Physics. Feynman started with those foundations and helped build the ground ﬂoor of the New Physics. His contri- butions touched almost every corner of the subject and have had a deep and abiding inﬂuence over the way that physicists think about the physical universe. Feynman was a theoretical physicist par excellence. Newton had been both experimentalist and theorist in equal measure. Einstein was quite simply contemptuous of experiment, preferring to put his faith in pure thought. Feynman was driven to develop a deep theoretical understanding of nature, but he always
