But  he  was probably  mainl y  indirectly  influenced  by  Plato  when  he  revived  the Platonic  Idea  of  a  primitive  society  (cp.,  however ,  notes  i  to  chapter  6  and 14  to  chapter  9);  but  a  direct  p roduct  of  the  Platonic  Renaissance  in  Italy was  San azzaro's  most  influentia l  book  Arcadia,  with  its  revival  of  Plato's idea  of  a  blesse d  primitive  society  of  Greek  (Porian)  hill  shepherds.  (For this  idea  of  Plat o's,  cp.  text  to  note  32  to  this  chapter .)  Thus  Romanticism (cp. also chapter 9) is historically indeed an of fspring of Platonism. (4)  How  far  the  modern  historicism  of  Comte  and  Mill,  and  of  Hegel and  Marx,  is  in fluenced  by  the  theistic  historicism  of  Giambattista  V ico's New  Science  (1725)  is  very  hard  to  say  :  V ico  himself  was  undoubtedly influenced  by  Plato,  as  well  as  by  St.  Augustine's  De  Civitate  Dei  and Machiavelli's  Discourses  on  Liv y .  Like  Plato  (cp.  ch.  5),  V ico  id entified  the *  na ture  '  of  a  th ing  with  its  '  origin'  (cp.,  Opere,  Ferrari's  second  ed.,  1852- 4,  vol.  V ,  p.  99 )  ;  and  he  believed  that  all  nations  must  pass  through  the same  co urse  of  development,  ac cording  to  one  universal  law .  Hi s  *  nations  ' (like  Hegel's)  may  thus  be  said  to  be  one  of  the  links  between  Plato's  ' Cities' and T oynbee's ' Civilizations '. 12  Cp.

It  is significant  that  Plato,  who  in  general  is  not  a  defender  of  priva te  property , defends this institution, when the property bought is a slave, by appealing to the lawful right of the buyer . Another  attack  upon  democracy  is  that  *  it  tramples  under  foot'  the educational  prin ciple  that  '  no  one  can  grow  up  to  be  a  good  ma n  unless  his earliest  years  were  given  to  noble  games'.

Like  Plato,  Aristotle  (e.g.  in  Pol., 1313^1,  I3i9b20   ;  and  in  his   C  onstitution  of  Athens,  59,  5),  testifies  to Athens'  liberalit y  towards  slaves  ;  and  so  does  the  Pseudo-Xe nophon  (cp. his Const, of Athens* I, 10, f.)

Statesman  (Politicus),  3Oic/d.  Although  Plato  distinguishes  six types  of   debased  states,  he  does   not  introduce  any  new  terms  ;  the  names  * monarchy  '  (or  '  kingship  ')  an d  '  aristocracy  '  are  used  in  the  Republic (445d)  o f  the  best  state  itself,  and  not  of  the  relatively  best  forms   of  debased states, as in the Statesman. 22 Gp.

(682e/683a).  So   far  we  have  heard  nothing  about  the  man ner  of  this settlement,  and  there  follows  a t  once  a  further  digression  (Pl ato  himself speaks  about  the  *  roundabout  track  of  the  ar gument')  until  we  get ultimately (in 683c/d) the * hint' mentioned in the text ; see (b). (b)  The  statement  in  the  text  that  we  get  a  hint  that  the  Dorian  * settlement  '  in  th e  Peloponnese  was  in  fact  a  violent  subjugation,  refers  to the  Laws  (683c/d),  where  Pla to  introduces  what  are  actually  his  first historical  remar ks  on  Sparta.  He  says  that  he  begins  at  the  time  when  the whole  o f  the  Peloponnese  was  *  practically  subjugated  '  by  the  Dorians.  In the  M enexenus  (whose  genuineness  can  hardly  be  doubted  ;  cp.  note  35  to chapter  10)  there  is  in  245C  an  allusion  to  the  fact  that  the  Pelo ponnesians were ' immigrants from abroad ' (as Grote puts it : cp. his Plato, III, p. 5). (c)  In  the  Republic  (369^  the  cit y  is  founded  by  workers  with  a  view  to the  a dvantages  of  a  division  of   labour  and  of  co-operation,  in   accordance with the contract theory . (d)  But  later  (in  Rep.,  4i5d/e  ;  see  the  quotation  in  the  text ,  to  this paragraph)  we  get  a  descriptio n  of  the  triumphant  invasion  of  a  warrior class  of  somewh at  mysterious  origin—the  '  earthborn'.  The  decisive  passage of  th is  description  states  that  the  earthborn  must  look  round  to  find  for  their camp  the  most  suitable  spot  (literally)  '  for  keeping  down  those  within',  i.e., for  k eeping  down  those  already  living  in  the  city ,  i.e.,  for  keepin g  down  the inhabitants. (e)  I n  th e  States man  (2713,  f.)  t hese  '  earthborn'  are  identified  with  the very early nomad hill shepherds of the pre-settlement period. (/)  T o  sum  up  it  seems  that  Pla to  had  a  fairly  clear  idea  of  the   Dorian conquest,  which  he  preferred,  for  obvious  reasons,  to  veil  in  mystery .  It  also seems  th at  there   was  a  traditio n  that  the  conquering  war  hord es  were  of nomad descent. (2)  W ith  the  remark  later  in  the  text  in  this  paragraph  regarding   Plato's  ' continuous  emp hasis  '  on  the  fact  that  ruling  is  shepherdin g,  cp.,  for instance,  the  following  passages  :  Republic,  3430,  where  the  idea  is introduced  ;  345C  f.,  where,  in  form  of  the  simile  of  the  good  shepherd,  it becomes  one  of  the  central  topics  of  the  investigation  ;  375a~376b,  4043, 44od,  45 10-6,  45ga~46oc,  and  466c-d  (quoted  in  note  30  to  chapter  5), where  the  auxiliaries  are  likened  to  sheep-dogs  and  where  their  breeding and  educ ation  is   discussed  accordingly  ;  4i6a,  f f.,  where  the  problem  of  the wolves  without  and  within  the  state  is  introduced  ;  cp.  furthermore,  the Statesman,  where  the  idea  is  continued  over  many  pages,  esp.  26id-276d. W ith  regard  to  the  Laws,  I  ma y  refer  to  the  passage  (6946),  where  Plato says  of  Cyrus  that  he  had  acquired  for  his  sons  '  cattle  and  shee p  and  many herds of men and other animals '. (Cp. also Laws, 735, and Theaet., i74d.) (3) W ith all this, cp. also A. J. T oynbee, A Study of History , esp. vol. Ill, pp.  3 2  (n.  i),  where  A.  H.  L ybye r ,  The  Government  of  the  Ottoman  Empire, etc.,  is  quoted,  33  (n.  2),  50-10 0  ;  see  more  especially  his  remark  on  the conquering  nomads  (p.  22)  who  *  deal  with  .  .  .  men  ',  and  on  Plato's  human watchdogs'  (p.  94,  n.  2).  I  have  been  much  stimulated  by  T oynbee's  brilliant ideas  and  much  encouraged  by  many  of  his  remarks  which  I  take  as corroborating  m y  interpretations ,  and  which  I  can  value  the  more  highly  the more  T oynbee's  and  my  fundam ental  assumptions  seem  to  disagree.  I  also owe  to  T oynbee  a  number  of  t erms  used  in  my  text,  especially  '  human cattle ', * human herd ' and ' human watch-dog '. T oynbee's  Study   of  History  is,  from  my  point  of  view ,  a  model  of  what  I call  hist oricism  ;  I  need  not  say  much  more  to  express  my  f undamental disagreement  with  it;  and  a  number  of  special  points  of  disagreement  will be  discussed  at  various  places  (cp.  notes  43  and  45  (2)  to  this  chapter ,  notes 7  and  8  to  chapter  10,  and  c hapter  24).  But  it  contains  a  wealth  of interesting  and  stimulating  ideas.  Regarding  Plato,  T oynbee  emphasizes  a number of points in which I can follow him, especially that Plato's best state is  inspired  by  his  experience  of   social  revolution  and  by  his  wish  to  arrest all  c hange,  and  that  it  is  a  kind   of  arrested  Sparta  (which  itse lf  was  also arrested).  T oynb ee  also  stresses  the  ideas  of  the  shepherd  of  men,  of  the human  sheep-d

w ay  of)  '  obtaining  good   of fspring,  or  none  at  all',  is  pe rfectly  clear in  m y  interpretation.  Since  the   rulers  have  merely  empirical  methods  at their  disposal,  it  would  be  onl y  a  lucky  accident  if  they  did  hit  upon  a method  whose  determination  needs  mathematical  or  other  rational  methods. Adam  su ggests  (note  to  546a,  by )  the  translation  :  '  none  the  mo re  will  they by  calcu lation  together  with  perception  obtain  good  of fspring'  ;  and  only  in brackets,  he  adds  :  *  lit.  hit  the  obtaining  of.  I  think  that  his  failure  to  make any  sense  of  the  '  hit'  is  a  consequence  of  his  failure  to  see  the  i mplications of (A). The  interpretation  here  suggested  makes  (C)  and  (D)  perfectly understandable  ;   and  Plato's  rem ark  that  his  Number  is  c  master  over  better or  worse  birth  ',   fits  in  perfectl y .  It  may  be  remarked  that  Adam  does  not comment  on  (D),  i.e.  the  ignorance,  although  such  a  commen t  would  be most  nec essary  in  view  of  his  theory  (note  to  54.66.22)  that  *  th e  number  is not a nuptial . . number', and that it has no technical eugenic meaning. That  the   meanin g  of  the  Numb er  is  indeed  technical  and  euge nic  is,  I think,  clear ,  if  we  consider  that  the  passage  containing  the  Number  is enclosed  in  passages  containing   references  to  eugenic  knowledge,  or  rather , lack  of  eugenic  knowledge.  Imm ediately  before  the  Number ,  (A),  (B),  (C), occur ,  an d  immediately  afterwards,  (/)),  as  well  as  the  story  of  th e  bride  and bridegroom  and  their  degenerate   of fspring.  Besides,  (C)  before  the  Number and  (D)  after  the  Number  refer  to  each  other  ;  for  (C),  the  '  blunder  ',  is connected  with  a  reference  to  c  begetting  in  the  wrong  manner   ',  and  (Z>), the  (  ignorance  ',  is  connected  with  an  exactly  analogous  reference,  viz.,  ' uniting bride and bridegroom in the wrong way'. (See also next note.) The  las t  point  in  which  I  must  defend  my  interpretation   is  my contention  that  those  who  know   the  Number  thereby  obtain  th e  power  to influence  '  better  or  worse  birt h  '.  This  does  not  of  course  f ollow  from Plato's  s tatement  that  the  Number  itself  has  such  power  ;  for  if  Adam's interpretation  is  right,  then  the  Number  regulates  the  births  because  it determines  an  unalterable  perio d  after  which  degeneration  is  b ound  to  set in.  B ut  I   mainta in  that  Plato's  re ferences  to  '  perception  ',  to  '  b lunder  '  and to  '  igno rance  '  as  the  immediate  cause  of  the  eugenic  mistakes  would  be pointless  if  he  did  not  mean  that  with  the  knowledge  of  appropriate mathematical  and  purely  rational  methods,  the  guardians  wou ld  not  have blundered.  But  this  makes  inevitable  the  inference  that  the  Nu mber  has  a technical eugenic meaning, and that its knowledge  gives  power  to  arrest  degeneration.  (This  inference  also seems  to   me  the  only  one  comp atible  with  all  we  know  about  this  type  of superstition  ;  all  astrology ,  for  instance,  includes  the  apparently  somewhat contradictory  conception  that  the  knowledge  of  our  fate  may  help  us  to unfluence  this  fate.)  I  think  that  the  attempts  to  explain  the  Number  as anything  but  a  secret  breeding  taboo  arise  from  the  reluctan ce  to  credit Plato with such crude ideas, even though he clearly expresses them. In other words, they arise from the tendency to idealize Plato. (2)  I n  this  connection,  I  must  refer  to  an  article  by  A.  E.  T aylo r ,  '  The Decline  and  Fall  of  The  State  in  Republic,  VIII  *  (Mind,  N.S.  4 8,  1939,  pp. 23  f f.).  In  this  article,  T aylor  attacks  Adam  (in  my  opinion  not  justly),  and maintains  against  him  :  '  It  is  t rue,  of  course,  that  the  decay  of  the  ideal State  is  expressly  said  in  546b  to  begin  when  the  ruling  class  "  beget children  out  of  due  season  "...  But  this  need  not  mean,  and  in  my  opinion does  not  mean,  that  Plato  is  concerning  himself  here  with  problems  of  the hygiene  of  reproduction.  The  m ain  thought  is  the  simple  one  that  if,  like everything  of  man's  making,  the  State  carries  the  seeds  of  its  own dissolution  within  it,  this  must,  of  course,  mean  that  sooner  or  later  the persons  wielding  supreme  pow er  will  be  inferior  to  those  who  preceded them  '  (pp.  25  f. ).  Now  this  interpretation  seems  to  me  not  only  untenable, in  view  of  Plato's  fairly  definite  statements,  but  also  a  typical  example  of the  a ttempt  to  el iminate  from  Plato's  writing  such  embarrassing  elements  as racialism  or  superstition.  Adam   began  by  denying  that  the  Number

recognition  thro ughout  Greece,  and  especially  in  Pcriclean  Athens,  is  most improbable. (Gp. (2) of this note.) (2)  In  the  text  I  have  called  Plato's  attitude  towards  music  (cp.  esp. Rep•>  398e,  f f.)  superstitious  a nd  backward  if  compared  with  *  a  more enlightened  contemporary  criticism'.  The  criticism  I  have  in  mind  is  that  of the  a nonymous  writer ,  probably  a  musician  of  the  fifth  (or  the  early  fourth) century ,  the  author  of  what  is  now  known  as  the  thirteenth  piece  of Grenfell-Hunt,  T he  Hibeh  Papyri,  1906,  p.  45  f f.  It  seems  poss ible  that  the writer  is  one  of   *  the  various  musicians  who  criticize  Socrates   '  (i.e.  the  ' Socrates  '  of  Plato's  Republic),  mentioned  by  Aristotle  (in  his  equally reactionary  Politics,  1342  b)  ;  but  the  criticism  of  the  anonymous  writer goes  mu ch  further  than  Aristotle  indicates.  Plato  (and  Aristotle)  believed that  certain  musical  modes,  for  instance,  the  '  slack'  Ionian  and  L ydian modes,  made  people  soft  and   ef feminate,  while  others,  especially  the Dorian  m ode,  made  them  brave.  This  view  is  attacked  by  the  anonymous writer .  '  They  sa y  ',  he  writes,  *  that  some  modes  produce  temperate  and others just men ; others, again, heroes. and  othe rs  cowa rds.'  He  proceeds  to  show  that  this  view  is  sil ly ,  since some  of  the  most  war -like  of  the  Greek  tribes  use  modes  reputed   to  produce cowards,  while  certain  professio nal  (opera)  singers  habitually  sing  in  the  * heroic'  m ode  without  ever  becoming  heroes.  This  criticism  might  have  been directed  against   the  Athenian  musician  Damos,  quoted  by  Plato  as  an authority ,  a  friend  of  Pericles  (who  was  liberal  enough  to  tolerate  a  pro- Spartan  attitude   in  the  field  of  artistic  criticism).  But  it  might  easily  have been directed against Plato himself. (3)  In  view  of  the  fact  that  I  am  attacking  a  '  reactionary'  attitude towards  music,  I  may  perhaps  remark  that  my  attack  is  in  no  way  inspired by  a  personal  sympathy  for  '  progress  '  in  music.  In  fact,  I  happen  to  like  old music  (the  older  the  better)  and  to  dislike  modern  music  intensely (especially  nearl y  everything  written  since  the  day  when  W agner  began  to write  music).  I  am  altogether  against  *  futurism  ',  whether  in  the  field  of  art or  of   mo rals  (cp.  chapter  22).  But  I  am  also  against  imposing  on e's  likes  and dislikes  upon  others,  and  again st  censorship  in  such  matters.  W e  can  love and  hate,  especially  in  art,  witho ut  favouring  legal  measures  for  suppressing what we hate, or for canonizing what we love. 42 Gp. Republic, 5373 ; and 4666-4676. The  characteriz ation  of  modern  totalitarian  education  is  due  to  A. Kolnai, The W ar against the W est (1938), p. 318. 43  P lato's  remarkable  theory  tha t  the  state,  i.e.  centralized  and  or ganized political  power ,   originates  through  a  conquest  (the  subjugation  of  a sedentary  agricultural  population  by  nomads  or  hunters)  was,  as  far  as  I know ,  fi rst  re-discovered  (if  we  discount  some  remarks  by  Machiavelli)  by Hume  in   his  criticism  of  the  hist orical  version  of  the  contract  theory  (cp.  his Political  Discou rses,  1752,  the  chapter  Of  the  Original  Contract)  :  —' Almost  all  the  g overnments  ',  Hume  writes,  *  which  exist  at  present,  or  of which  there  remains  any  record  in  history ,  have  been  founded  o riginally  on usurpation  or  conquest,  or  both  .  .  .'  The  theory  was  next  revived  by  Renan, in  What   is  a  Na tion?  (1882),  and  by  Nietzsche  in  his  Genealog y  of  Morals (1887)  ;  sec  the  third  German  edition  of  1894,  P-  9&  The  latter  writes  of  the origin  o f  the  *  state  '  :  '  Some  horde  of  blonde  beasts,  a  conquering  master race  with  a  war - like  or ganization   .  .  lay  their  terrifying  paws  heavily  upon  a population  whic h  is  perhaps  immensely  superior  in—numbers.  .  .  This  is the  way  in  whi ch  the  "  state  "  originates  upon  earth  ;  I  think  that  the sentimentality  w hich  lets  it  ori ginate  with  a  "  contract  ",  is  dead.'  This theory  appeals  to  Nietzsche  because  he  likes  these  blonde  beasts.  But  it  has been  also  more  recently  prof fered  by  F .  Oppenheimer  (The  State,  transl. Gitterman,  1914,  p.  68)  ;  by  a  Marxist,  K.  Kautsky  (in  his  b ook  on  The Materialist  Interpretation  of  History]  ;  and  by  W .  G.  Macleod  (The  Origin and  Hist ory  of  Politics,  1931).  I  think  it  very  likely  that  some thing  of  the kind  described  by  Plato,  Hume,  and  Nietzsche  has  happened  in  many ,  if  not in  all,  cases.  I  am  speaking  only  about  '

states  '  in  the  sense  of  or ganized  and even centralized political power . I  ma y  mention  that  T oynbee  h as  a  very  dif ferent  theory .  But  before discussing  it,  I  w ish  first  to  make  it  clear  that  from  the  anti-hist oricist  point of  v iew ,  the  question  is  of  no  great  importance.  It  is  perhaps  interesting  in itself  to  conside r  how  *  states  '  originated,  but  it  has  no  bearin g  whatever upon  the  sociology  of  states ,  as  I  understand  it,  i.e.  upon  political technology (see chapters 3, 9, and 25). T oynbee's  theor y  does  not  confine  itself  to  '  states  '  in  the  sense  of or ganized  and  centralized  politi cal  power .  He  discusses,  rather ,  the  '  origin of  civili zations  '.  But  here  begins  the  dif ficulty  ;  for  what  he  calls  * civilizations  '  are,  in  part,  '  states  '  (as  here  described),  in  part  societies  like that  of  the  Eskim os,  which  are  n ot  states  ;  and  if  it  is  questionable  whether  ' states'  o riginate  according  to  one  single  scheme,  then  it  must  be  even  more doubtful when we consider  a  class  of  such  diverse  social  phenomena  as  the  early  Egyptian and  Mesopotam ian  states  and  their  institutions  and  technique   on  the  one side, and the Eskimo way of living on the other . But  we  may  con centrate  on  T oynbee's  description  (A  Study  of  History , vol.  I,  305  f f.)  of  the  origin   of  the  Egyptian  and  Meso potamian  ' civilizations  '.  His  theory  is  that  the  challenge  of  a  dif fi cult  jungle environment  rouses  a  response   from  ingenious  and  enterprising  leaders  ; they  lead  their  followers  into  the  valleys  which  they  begin  to  cultivate,  and found  states.  This  (Hegelian  and   Ber gsonian)  theory  of  the  cre ative  genius as  a  cultural  and  political  leade r  appears  to  me  most  romantic.  If  we  take Egypt,  then  we  must  look,  first  of  all,  for  the  origin  of  the  caste  system. This,  I  believe,  is  most  likely  th e  result  of  conquests,  just  as  in  India  where every  new  wave  of  conquerors  i mposed  a  new  caste  upon  the  old  ones.  But there  are  other  ar guments.  T o ynbee  himself  favours  a  theory  which  is probably  correct,  namely ,  that  animal  breeding  and  especially  animal training  is  a  l ater ,  a  more  a dvanced  and  a  more  dif ficult  stage  of development  tha n  mere  agriculture,  and  that  this  advanced  step   is  taken  by the  n omads  of  the  steppe.  But  in  Egypt  we  find  both  agriculture   and  animal breeding,  and  the  same  holds  for  most  of  the  early  *  states  '  (tho ugh  not  for all  the  American   ones,  I  gather).  This  seems  to  be  a  sign  that  these  states contain  a  nomadic  element;  and  it  seems  only  natural  to  venture  the hypothesis  that  this  element  is  due  to  nomad  invaders  imposing  their  rule,  a caste  rul e,  upon  the  original  agricultural  population.  This  theory  disagrees with  T o ynbee's  contention  (op.  cit.  9  Ill,  ^3  f.)  that  nomad-built  states usually  wither  away  very  quickl y .  But  the  fact  that  many  of  the  early  caste states go in for the breeding of animals has to be explained somehow . The  idea  that  nomads  or  even  hunters  constituted  the  original  upper class  is  corroborated  by  the  age- old  and  still  surviving  upper -class  traditions according  to  which  war ,  hunting ,  and  horses,  are  the  symbols  of  the  leisured classes  ;   a  tradition  which  formed  the  basis  of  Aristotle's  ethics  and  politics, and  is  still  alive,  as  V eblen  (The  Theory  of  the  Leisure  Class)  and  T oynbee himself  have  shown  ;  and  to  these  traditions  we  can  perhaps  add   the  animal breeder's  belief  in  racialism,  an d  especially  in  the  racial  superiority  of  the upper  class.  The  latter  belief  which  is  so  pronounced  in  caste  states  and  in Plato  an d  in  Aristotle  is  held  by  T oynbee  to  be  *  one  of  the  .  .  si ns  of  our  .  . modern  age  '  and  '  something  alien  from  the  Hellenic  genius  '  (op.  cit.,  Ill, 93).  But  although  many  Greeks   may  have  developed  beyond  racialism,  it seems  likely  that  Plato's  and  Aristotle's  theories  are  based  on  old  traditions  ; especially in view of the fact that racial ideas played such a role in Sparta. 44 Cp. Laws, 6943-6983. 45  ( i)  Spengler's  Decline  of  the   W est  is  not  in  my  opinion  to  be  taken seriously .  But  it  is  a  symptom  ;  it  is  the  theory  of  one  who  believes  in  an upper  class  which  is  facing  defe at.  Like  Plato,  Spengler  tries  to   show  that  ' the  world  *  is  to  be  blamed,  wit h  its  general  law  of  decline  and  death.  And like  Plat o,  he  demands  (in  his  sequel,  Prussianism  and  Social ism)  a  new order ,  a  desperat e

w ay  of)  '  obtaining  good   of fspring,  or  none  at  all',  is  pe rfectly  clear in  m y  interpretation.  Since  the   rulers  have  merely  empirical  methods  at their  disposal,  it  would  be  onl y  a  lucky  accident  if  they  did  hit  upon  a method  whose  determination  needs  mathematical  or  other  rational  methods. Adam  su ggests  (note  to  546a,  by )  the  translation  :  '  none  the  mo re  will  they by  calcu lation  together  with  perception  obtain  good  of fspring'  ;  and  only  in brackets,  he  adds  :  *  lit.  hit  the  obtaining  of.  I  think  that  his  failure  to  make any  sense  of  the  '  hit'  is  a  consequence  of  his  failure  to  see  the  i mplications of (A). The  interpretation  here  suggested  makes  (C)  and  (D)  perfectly understandable  ;   and  Plato's  rem ark  that  his  Number  is  c  master  over  better or  worse  birth  ',   fits  in  perfectl y .  It  may  be  remarked  that  Adam  does  not comment  on  (D),  i.e.  the  ignorance,  although  such  a  commen t  would  be most  nec essary  in  view  of  his  theory  (note  to  54.66.22)  that  *  th e  number  is not a nuptial . . number', and that it has no technical eugenic meaning. That  the   meanin g  of  the  Numb er  is  indeed  technical  and  euge nic  is,  I think,  clear ,  if  we  consider  that  the  passage  containing  the  Number  is enclosed  in  passages  containing   references  to  eugenic  knowledge,  or  rather , lack  of  eugenic  knowledge.  Imm ediately  before  the  Number ,  (A),  (B),  (C), occur ,  an d  immediately  afterwards,  (/)),  as  well  as  the  story  of  th e  bride  and bridegroom  and  their  degenerate   of fspring.  Besides,  (C)  before  the  Number and  (D)  after  the  Number  refer  to  each  other  ;  for  (C),  the  '  blunder  ',  is connected  with  a  reference  to  c  begetting  in  the  wrong  manner   ',  and  (Z>), the  (  ignorance  ',  is  connected  with  an  exactly  analogous  reference,  viz.,  ' uniting bride and bridegroom in the wrong way'. (See also next note.) The  las t  point  in  which  I  must  defend  my  interpretation   is  my contention  that  those  who  know   the  Number  thereby  obtain  th e  power  to influence  '  better  or  worse  birt h  '.  This  does  not  of  course  f ollow  from Plato's  s tatement  that  the  Number  itself  has  such  power  ;  for  if  Adam's interpretation  is  right,  then  the  Number  regulates  the  births  because  it determines  an  unalterable  perio d  after  which  degeneration  is  b ound  to  set in.  B ut  I   mainta in  that  Plato's  re ferences  to  '  perception  ',  to  '  b lunder  '  and to  '  igno rance  '  as  the  immediate  cause  of  the  eugenic  mistakes  would  be pointless  if  he  did  not  mean  that  with  the  knowledge  of  appropriate mathematical  and  purely  rational  methods,  the  guardians  wou ld  not  have blundered.  But  this  makes  inevitable  the  inference  that  the  Nu mber  has  a technical eugenic meaning, and that its knowledge  gives  power  to  arrest  degeneration.  (This  inference  also seems  to   me  the  only  one  comp atible  with  all  we  know  about  this  type  of superstition  ;  all  astrology ,  for  instance,  includes  the  apparently  somewhat contradictory  conception  that  the  knowledge  of  our  fate  may  help  us  to unfluence  this  fate.)  I  think  that  the  attempts  to  explain  the  Number  as anything  but  a  secret  breeding  taboo  arise  from  the  reluctan ce  to  credit Plato with such crude ideas, even though he clearly expresses them. In other words, they arise from the tendency to idealize Plato. (2)  I n  this  connection,  I  must  refer  to  an  article  by  A.  E.  T aylo r ,  '  The Decline  and  Fall  of  The  State  in  Republic,  VIII  *  (Mind,  N.S.  4 8,  1939,  pp. 23  f f.).  In  this  article,  T aylor  attacks  Adam  (in  my  opinion  not  justly),  and maintains  against  him  :  '  It  is  t rue,  of  course,  that  the  decay  of  the  ideal State  is  expressly  said  in  546b  to  begin  when  the  ruling  class  "  beget children  out  of  due  season  "...  But  this  need  not  mean,  and  in  my  opinion does  not  mean,  that  Plato  is  concerning  himself  here  with  problems  of  the hygiene  of  reproduction.  The  m ain  thought  is  the  simple  one  that  if,  like everything  of  man's  making,  the  State  carries  the  seeds  of  its  own dissolution  within  it,  this  must,  of  course,  mean  that  sooner  or  later  the persons  wielding  supreme  pow er  will  be  inferior  to  those  who  preceded them  '  (pp.  25  f. ).  Now  this  interpretation  seems  to  me  not  only  untenable, in  view  of  Plato's  fairly  definite  statements,  but  also  a  typical  example  of the  a ttempt  to  el iminate  from  Plato's  writing  such  embarrassing  elements  as racialism  or  superstition.  Adam   began  by  denying  that  the  Number
========================================================
adopts  the  theory  of  a  cosmic  catastrophe  which  leads  to the  c hange  from  the  (Empedocle an)  half-circle  of  love  to  the  present  period, the  half-circle  of  strife.  This  idea  seems  to  have  been  dropped  in  the T imaeus,  in  order  to  be  replaced   by  a  theory  (retained  in  the  La ws)  of  more limited  catastrophes,  such  as  floods,  which  may  destroy  civilizations,  but apparently  do  not  af fect  the  cou rse  of  the  universe.  (It  is  possible  that  this solution  of  the  p roblem  was  suggested  to  Plato  by  the  fact  that  in  373-372 B.C.,  the  ancient  city  of  Helice  was  destroyed  by  earthquake  and  flood.) The  earl iest  form   of  society ,  re moved  in  the  Republic  only  by   one  single step  from  the  still  existing  Spartan  state  is  thrust  back  to  a  more  and  more distant  past.  Although  Plato  co ntinues  to  believe  that  the  firs t  settlement must  be  the  best   city ,  he  now  discusses  societies  prior  to  the  firs t  settlement, i.e. nomad societies, ' hill shepherds'. (Cp. esp. note 33 to this chapter .) 8  The  quotation   is  from  Marx-E ngcls,  The  Communist  Manifesto  ;  cp. A Handbook of Marxism (edited by E. Burns, 1935), 22. 9  Th e  qu otation  is  from  Adam's  comments  on  book  VIII  of  the  Republic ; see his edition, vol. II, 198, note to 544a3. 10 Cp. Republic, 5440. 1 1  ( i)  As  opposed  to  my  contention  that  Plato,  like  many  modern sociologists  since  Comte,  tries  to  outline  the  typical  stages  of  social development,  m ost  critics  take  Plato's  story  merely  as  a  somewh at  dramatic presentation  of  a  purely  logical   classification  of  constitutions.  But  this  not only  con tradicts  what  Plato  says  (cp.  Adam's  note  to  Rep.,  54409,  op.  cit., vol.  II,  i99)>  but  it  is  also  agains t  the  whole  spirit  of  Plato's  logic,  according to  which  the  essence  of  a  thing  is  to  be  understood  by  its  nature,  i.e.  by  its historical  origin .  And  we  must  not  for get  that  he  uses  the  sa me  word,  ' genus  ',  to  mean  a  class  in  the  logical  sense  and  a  race  in  the  biological sense.  The  logical  *  genus  '  is  still  identical  with  the  '  race  ',  in  the  sense  of' of fspring  of  the  same  parent'.  (W ith  this,  cp.  notes  15  to  20  to  ch apter  3,  and text,  as  well  as  notes  23-24  to  ch apter  5,  and  text,  where  the  equation  nature ~  origin  =  race  is  discussed.)  Accordingly ,  there  is  every  reason  for  taking what  Plato  says  at  its  face  value  ;  for  even  if  Adam  were  right  when  he  says (loc.  cit. )  that  Plato  intends  to  g ive  a  *  logical  order  ',  this  orde r  would  for him  be  at  the  sa me  time  that  o f  a  typical  historical  development.  Adam's remark  (loc.  cit.)  that  the  order  '  is  primarily  determined  by  psychological and  not  by  historical  considerat ions  '  turns,  I  believe,  against  him.  For  he himself  points  out  (for  instance,   op.  cit.,  vol.  II,  195,  note  to  5433,  f f.)  that Plato  '  retains  throughout  .  .  th e  analogy  between  the  Soul  an d  the  City'. According  to  Plato's  political  theory  of  the  soul  (which  will  be  discussed  in the  next   chapter),  the  psychological  history  must  run  parallel  t o  the  social history ,  and  the  alleged  opposition  between  psychological  and  historical considerations  d isappears,  turning  into  another  ar gument  in  favour  of  our interpretation. (2)  E xactly  the  s ame  reply  could  be  made  if  somebody  should  ar gue  that Plato's  o rder  of  the  constitution  is,  fundamentally ,  not  a  log ical  but  an ethical  one  ;  fo r  the  ethical  ord er  (and  the  aesthetic  order  as  well)  is,  in Plato's  philosophy ,  indistinguishable  from  the  historical  order .  In  this connection, it may be remarked that this historicist view provides Plato with a  the oretical  background  for  So crates'  eudemonism,  i.e.  of  the  theory  that goodness  and  happiness  are  identical.  This  theory  is  developed,  in  the Republic (cp. especially 58ob),  i n  the  form  of  the  doctrine  that  goodness  and  happiness,  or badness  and  unhappiness,  are  proportional  ;  and  so  they  must  be,  if  the degree  o f  the  goodness  as  well  as  of  the  happiness  of  a  man  is  to  be measured  by  the  degree  in  which  he  resembles  the  perfect  Idea  of  man. (The  fac t  that  Plato's  theory  leads,  in  this  point,  to  a  theoretical  justification of  an  apparently  paradoxical  Socratic  doctrine  may  well  have  helped  Plato to  co nvince  himself  that  he  was  only  expounding  the  true  Socratic  creed  ; see text to notes 56/57 to chapter 10. (3)  Rousseau  took  over  Plato's  classification  of  institutions  (Social Contract,  Book  II,  ch.  VII,  Book  III,  ch.  Ill  f f.,
========================================================
of  Book  VIII can  still  be  surpassed,  namely ,  a s  Adam  says,  by  the  city  of  Books  V -VII— the ideal city in heaven.) In  h is  book,  Pl ato's  Cosmology ,  pp.  6  f f.,  Cornford  reconstructs  the outlines  and  contents  of  Plato's   unfinished  trilogy ,  T imaeus  —  Critias  — Hermocrates,  an d  shows  how  th ey  are  related  to  the  historical  parts  of  the Laws  (B ook  III) .  This  reconstruction  is,  I  think,  a  valuable  corroboration  of my  theo ry  that  Plato's  view  of  t he  world  was  fundamentally  historical,  and that  his  interest  in  *  how  it  generated  '  (and  how  it  decays)  is  linked  with  his theory  of  Ideas,  and  indeed  based  on  it.  But  if  that  is  so,  then  there  is  no reason  why  we  should  assume  t hat  the  later  books  of  the  Republic  '  started from  the  question  how  it'  (i.e.  th e  city)  *  might  be  realized  in  the  future  and sketched  its  possible  decline  th rough  lower  forms  of  polities'  (Cornford, op.cit.,  6  ;  italic s  mine)  ;  but  we  should,  especially  in  view  o f  the  close parallelism  betw een  the  third  bo ok  of  the  Laws  and  the  eighth  book  of  the Republic,  consid er  it  as  a  simplified  historical  sketch  of  the  actual  decline of  the  ideal  city  of  the  past,  a nd  as  an  explanation  of  the  origin  of  the existing  states,  analogous  to  the  greater  task  set  by  Plato  for  himself  in  the T imaeus, in the unfinished trilogy , and in the Laws. (sj) In connection with my remark, later in the paragraph, that Plato *  certain ly  knew   that  he  did  not  possess  the  necessary  data',   see  for instance Laws, 683d, and England's note to 683d2. (3)  T p  m y  rema rk  further  on  in  the  paragraph,  that  Plato  recognized  the Cretan  a nd  Spar tan  societies  as  petrified  or  arrested  (and  to  the  remark  in the  next   paragraph  that  Plato's  b est  state  is  not  only  a  class  state  but  a  caste state)  the  following  may  be  added.  (Cp.  also  note  20  to  this  chapter ,  and  24 to chapter 10.) In Laws, 79 yd (in the introduction to the ' important pronouncement', as England  calls  it,  quoted  in  the  text  to  note  3  to  this  chapter)  Pla to  makes  it perfectly clear that his Cretan and Spartan interlocutors are aware of the *  arreste d'  character  of  their  s ocial  institutions  ;  Clenias,  the  Cretan interlocutor ,  emphasizes  that  he  is  anxious  to  listen  to  any  defence  of  the archaic  character  of  a  state.  A  little  later  (799a),  and  in  the  sam e  context,  a direct  reference  is  made  to  the  Egyptian  method  of  arresting  the development  of  institutions  ;  surely  a  clear  indication  that  Plato  recognized a  t endency  in  Cr ete  and  Sparta  p arallel  to  that  of  Egypt,  namely ,  to  arrest  all social change. In  this  context,  a  passage  in  the   T imaeus  (see  especially  24a-b)  seems important.  In  this  passage,  Plato   tries  to  show  (a)  that  a  class  division  very similar  to  that  of  the  Republic  was  established  in  Athens  at  a  v ery  ancient period  o f  its  pre-historical  development,  and  (b)  that  these  institutions  were closely  akin  to  t he  caste  system  of  Egypt  (whose  arrested  caste  institutions he  assum es  to  have  derived  from  his  ancient  Athenian  state).   Thus  Plato himself  acknowl edges  by  implication  that  the  ideal  ancient  and  perfect  state of  t he  Republic  is  a  caste  s tate.  It  is  interesting  that   G  rantor ,  first commentator  on   the  T imaeus,  reports,  only  two  generations  after  Plato,  that Plato  h ad  been  accused  of  d eserting  the  Athenian  tradition,  and  of becoming  a  disciple  of  the  E gyptians.  (Cp.  Gomperz,  Greek  Thinkers, Germ,  ed.,  II,  476.)  See  also  Isocrates*  Busiris,  quoted  in  note  3  to  chapter 13. For  the  problem  of  the  castes  in  the  Republic,  see  furthermore  notes  31 and  32  (i,  d)  to  this  chapter ,  note  40  to  chapter  6,  and  notes  1 1-14  to  chapter 8.  A .  E.

I  a gree  that  Plato  in  the  Republic  ^Ggb-c) opposed  the  enslavement  of  Gre ek  prisoners  of  war  ;  but  he  enco uraged  that of  barbarians.

But  he  was probably  mainl y  indirectly  influenced  by  Plato  when  he  revived  the Platonic  Idea  of  a  primitive  society  (cp.,  however ,  notes  i  to  chapter  6  and 14  to  chapter  9);  but  a  direct  p roduct  of  the  Platonic  Renaissance  in  Italy was  San azzaro's  most  influentia l  book  Arcadia,  with  its  revival  of  Plato's idea  of  a  blesse d  primitive  society  of  Greek  (Porian)  hill  shepherds.  (For this  idea  of  Plat o's,  cp.  text  to  note  32  to  this  chapter .)  Thus  Romanticism (cp. also chapter 9) is historically indeed an of fspring of Platonism. (4)  How  far  the  modern  historicism  of  Comte  and  Mill,  and  of  Hegel and  Marx,  is  in fluenced  by  the  theistic  historicism  of  Giambattista  V ico's New  Science  (1725)  is  very  hard  to  say  :  V ico  himself  was  undoubtedly influenced  by  Plato,  as  well  as  by  St.  Augustine's  De  Civitate  Dei  and Machiavelli's  Discourses  on  Liv y .  Like  Plato  (cp.  ch.  5),  V ico  id entified  the *  na ture  '  of  a  th ing  with  its  '  origin'  (cp.,  Opere,  Ferrari's  second  ed.,  1852- 4,  vol.  V ,  p.  99 )  ;  and  he  believed  that  all  nations  must  pass  through  the same  co urse  of  development,  ac cording  to  one  universal  law .  Hi s  *  nations  ' (like  Hegel's)  may  thus  be  said  to  be  one  of  the  links  between  Plato's  ' Cities' and T oynbee's ' Civilizations '. 12  Cp.

It  is significant  that  Plato,  who  in  general  is  not  a  defender  of  priva te  property , defends this institution, when the property bought is a slave, by appealing to the lawful right of the buyer . Another  attack  upon  democracy  is  that  *  it  tramples  under  foot'  the educational  prin ciple  that  '  no  one  can  grow  up  to  be  a  good  ma n  unless  his earliest  years  were  given  to  noble  games'.

the  law  (III,  80,  6)  ;  see  also  note  14  to  this  chapter .  The passage  from  Herodotus,  which   influenced  Plato  in  other  wa ys  also  (cp. note  24  to  chapt er  4),  is  one  which  Plato  ridicules  in  the  Republ ic  just  as  he ridicules Pericles' oration ; rp. note 14 to chapter 4 and 34 to chapter 10. 18  E ven  the  naturalist  Aristotle  does  not  always  refer  to  this  nat uralistic version  of  equalitarianism  ;  for  instance,  his  formulation  of  the  principles  of democracy  in  Politics,  i^ijb  (cp.  note  9  to  this  chapter ,  and  te xt)  is  quite independent  of  it.  But  it  is  perha ps  even  more  interesting  that  in  the  Gor gias in  which  the  opposition  of  nature  and  convention  plays  such  an  important role,  Plato  presents  equalitarian ism  without  burdening  it  with  the  dubious theory  of  the  na tural  equality  of  all  men  (see  4886  /48ga,  quoted  in  note  14 to this chapter , and 483d, 4843, and 5083). 19 Cp. Menexenus, 238e/23ga. The passage immediately follows a clear allusion  to  Pericles'  oration  (viz.,  to  the  second  sentence  quoted  in  the  text to  note  17,  in  this  chapter).—It  seems  not  improbable  that  the  reiteration  of the  term  '  equal  birth  '  in  that  passage  is  meant  as  a  scornful  allu sion  to  the  ' low  *  birth  of  Pericles'  and  Aspasia's  sons,  who  were  rec ognized  as Athenian citizens only  by   special  legislation  in  429  B.C.  (Cp.  E.  Meyer ,  Gesch.  d. Altertums, vol. IV , p. 14, note to No. 392, and p. 323, No. 558.) (It  has  been  held  (even  by  Grote  ;  cp.  his  Plato,  III,  p.  1 1)  that  Plato  in the  M enexenus,  '  in  his  own  rhetorical  discourse,  .  .  drops  the  iro nical  vein  ', i.e.  that  the  middle  part  of  the  Menexenus,  from  which  the  quotation  in  the text  is  taken,  is  not  meant  ironic ally .  But  in  view  of  the  quoted  passage  on equality ,  and  in  view  of  Plato's  open  scorn  in  the  Republic  when  he  deals with  this  point  (cp.  note  14  to  this  chapter),  this  opinion  se ems  to  me untenable.  And  it  appears  to  me  equally  impossible  to  doubt  the  ironical character  of  the  passage  immediately  preceding  the  one  quoted  in  the  text where  Plato  says  of  Athens  (cp.  238c/d)  :  '  In  this  time  as  well  as   at  present  . .  ou r  government  was  always  an  aristocracy  .  .  ;  though  it  is  sometimes called  a  democracy ,  it  is  really  an  aristocracy ,  that  is  to  say ,  a  rule  of  the best,  with  the  approval  of  the   many  .  .'  In  view  of  Plato' s  hatred  of democracy ,  this  description  needs  no  further  comment .—For  the genuineness of the Menexenus, cp. also note 35 to chapter 10. 20 Laws, 757a ; cp. the whole passage 7573-0. (1)  F or  what  I  call  the  standard  objection  against  cqualitarianism,  cp. also  Laws,  744b,  f f.  'It  would  b e  excellent  if  everybody  could  .  .  have  all things  eq ual  ;  but  since  this  is  im possible  .  .',  etc.  The  passage  is  especially interesting  in  view  of  the  fact  th at  Plato  is  often  described  as  an  enemy  of plutocracy by many writers who judge him only by the Republic. But in this important  passag e  of  the  Laws  (i.e.  744b,  f f.)  Plato  demands  that  *  political of fices,  and  contributions,  as  well  as  distributions  of  bounties,  should  be proportional  to  the  value  of  a  ci tizen's  wealth.  And  they  should  depend  not only  on  his  virtue  or  that  of  his  ancestors  or  on  the  size  and  attractiveness  of his  body ,  but  a4so  upon  his  wealth  or  his  poverty .  In  this  way ,   a  man  will receive  honours  and  of fices  as  equitably  as  possible,  i.e.  in  proportion  to  his wealth,  although  according  to  a  principle  of  unequal  distribution.'  The  basic idea  of  this  attitude,  viz.,  that  it  is  unjust  to  treat  unequals  equ ally ,  can  be found,  in   a  passing  remark,  as  e arly  as  the  Protagoras  (337a)  ;  but  Plato  did not make much use of the idea before writing the Laws. (2)  F or  A ristotle's  elaboration  of   these  ideas,  cp.  esp.  his  Politics,  III,  9, i,  i28 oa  (see  also  III,  12-13,  12820-1284^,  where  he  writes  :  *  A ll  men  cling to  justice  of  some  kind,  but  their  conceptions  are  imperfect,  and  do  not embrace  the  whole  Idea.  For  ex ample,  justice  is  thought  (by  de mocrats)  to be  equality  ;  and  so  it  is,  although  it  is  not  equality  for  all,  but  only  for equals.  And  justice  is  thought  ( by  oligarchs)  to  be  inequality  ;  and  so  it  is, although it is not inequality for all, but only for unequals.' (3)  A gainst  all  this  anti-equalit arianism,  I  maintain,  with  Kant,  that  it must  be  the  principle  of  all  morality  that  no  man  should  consider  himself more  valuable  than  any  other

Plat o,  however , uses  the  same  naturalistic  ar gument  to  prove  the  opposite  ;  for ,  he  ar gues, are  not  dogs  of  both  sexes  useful  for  watching  as  well  as  hunting  ?  '  Do  you agree  ',  he  writes  (Rep.,  466c-d) ,  '  that  women  .  .  must  participa te  with  men in  guarding  as  w ell  as  in  hunting,  as  it  is  with  dogs  ;  .  .  and  that  in  so  doing, they  wil l  be  acting  in  the  most  desirable  manner ,  since  this  will  be  not contrary  to  nature,  but  in  accordance  with  the  natural  relations  of  the  sexes ?

I  believe  Plato  to  indicate  that  the  philosopher  kin g  of  Books VI—VII,  whose  main  interest  is  in  the  things  that  are  not  generated  and
========================================================
expect  to  see  the Ideas associated with light and goodness. (Gp. end of note 32 to chapter 8.) (3)  T he  Ideas  ar e  boundaries  or  limits,  they  are  definite,  as  opp osed  to indefinite  Space,  and  impress  or  imprint  (cp.  note  17  (2)  to  this  chapter) themselves  like  rubber -stamps,  or  better ,  like  moulds,  upon  Space  (which  is not  only  space  b ut  at  the  same  time  Anaximander's  unformed  m atter—  stuf f without property), thus generating sensible things. (4)  In  consequence  of  the  act  o f  generation,  Space,  i.e.  the  rec eptacle, begins  to  labour ,  so  that  all  things  are  set  in  motion,  in  a  Heraclitean  or Empedoclean  flux  which  is  really  universal  in  so  far  as  the  movement  or flux  extends  even  to  the  framework,  i.e.  (boundless)  space  itse lf.  (For  the late Heraclitean idea of the receptacle, cp. the Cratylus, 4i2d.) (5)  This  description  is  also  re miniscent  of  Parmenides*  *  W ay  of Delusive  Opinion  ',  in  which  the   world  of  experience  and  of  flux  is  created by  the  mingling   of  two  opposite s,  the  light  (or  hot  or  fire)  and  the  dark  (or cold  or  •earth).  It  is  clear  that  P lato's  Forms  or  Ideas  would  co rrespond  to the O.s.i.E.—VOL. I G former ,  and  space  or  what  is  bo undless  to  the  latter  ;  especially  if  we consider that Plato's pure space i« also indeterminate matter . (6)  The  opposition  between  the  determinate  and  indeterminate  seems also  to  correspo nd,  especially  after  the  discovery  of  the  irrationality  of  the square  root  of  two,  to  the  opposition  between  the  rational  and  the  irrational. But  since  Parmenides  identifies  the  rational  with  being,  this  would  lead  to an  interpretation  of  space  or  the  irrational  as  non-being.  In  other  words,  the Pythagorean  tab le  of  opposites  is  to  be  extended  to  cover  rationality ,  as opposed  to  irrationality ,  and  be ing,  as  opposed  to  non-being.  ( This  would explain  Aristotle 's  remark  in  Metaphysics,  g86b27  ;  and  it  wo uld  perhaps not  be  necessary  to  assume,  as  F .  M.  Cornford  does  in  his  excellent  article  ' Parmenides'  T wo   W ays',  Class.  Quart.,  XVII,  1933,  p.  108,  that  Parmenides, fr .  8 ,  53/54,  *  has  been  misinterpreted  by  Aristotle  and  Theo-phrastus  '  ;  for if  w e  ex pand  the   table  of  opposi tes  in  this  way ,  Cornford's  most   convincing interpretation  of  the  crucial  passage  of  fr .  8  becomes  compatible  with Aristotle's remark.) (7)   C  ornford  has  explained  (op.  cit.,  100)  that  there  are  three  '  ways  '  in Parmenides,  the   way  of  T ruth ,  the  way  of  Not-being,  and  the  way  of Seeming  (or ,  if  I  may  call  it  so,  of  delusive  opinion).  He  show s  (101)  that they  cor respond  to  three  regions  discussed  in  the  Republic,  the  perfectly real  and   rational   world  of  the  Ideas,  the  perfectly  unreal,  and  the  world  of opinion (based on the perception of things in flux). He has also shown (102) that  in  the  Sophist,  Plato  modifies  his  position.  T o  this,  some  comments may  be  added  from  the  point  o f  view  of  the  passages  in  the  T imaeus  to which this note is appended. (8)  T he  main  dif ference  between   the  Forms  or  Ideas  of  the  Repu blic  and those  of   the  T imaeus  is  that  in  the  former ,  the  Forms  (and  als o  God  ;  cp. Rep.,  38 od)  are  petrified,  so  to  s peak,  while  in  the  latter ,  they  are  deified.  In the  former ,  they  bear  a  much  c loser  resemblance  to  the  Parmenidean  One (cp.  Adam's  note  to  Rep.,  38od28,  31),  than  in  the  latter .  This  development leads  to  the  La ws,  where  the  Ideas  are  lar gely  replaced  by  souls.  The decisive  dif feren ce  is  that  the  Ideas  become  more  and  more  the  starting points,  or  even  causes,  of  motion,  or  as  the  T imaeus  puts  it,  fathers  of  the moving  things.  The  greatest  contrast  is  perhaps  between  the  Phaedo,  796  :  ' The  sou l  is  infinitely  more  like  the  unchangeable  ;  even  the  most  stupid person  would  not  deny  that'  (cp .  also  Rep.,  585^  6oo,b  f.)  and  the  Laws, 8956/8g6a  (cp.  Phaedrus,  245C  f f.)  :  '  What  is  the  definition  of  t hat  which  is named  "  soul  "  ?  Can  we  imagine  any  other  definition  than  .  .  "  The  motion that moves itself" ? ' (Cp. also note 7 to chapter 4.) (9)  In  this  develo pment  of  Plato's  thought,  a  development  whose  driving force  is  to  explain  the  world  of  flux  with  the  help  of  the  Ideas,  i.e.  to  make the  break  between  the  world  of  reason  and  the  world  of  opinion  at  least understandable,  even  though  it  cannot  be  bridged,  the  Sophist  se ems  to  play a  decisive  role.  Apart  from  making  room,  as  Cornford  mentions  (op.  cit.  9 102),  fo r  the
========================================================
certain code  is  not  only  c  paper  '  but  suc cessfully  enforced,  that  it  is  *  sound  ',  or  in other  wo rds,  all  legislation  whic h  does  not  turn  out  to  be  merel y  paper  is  a copy of human nature and therefore just. (4)  I  now  proce ed  to  a  brief  criticism  of  the  ar gument  prof fered  by Catlin  against  the  distinction  between  (a)  laws  of  nature  whic h  cannot  be broken,  and  (b)  normative  laws,  which  are  man-made,  i.e.  enforced  by sanctions  ;  a  distinction  which  he  himself  makes  so  very  clearly  at  first. Catlin's  ar gument  is  a  twofold  on e.  He  shows  (a)  that  laws  of  na ture  also  are man-made,  in  a  certain  sense,  and  that  they  can,  in  a  sense,  be  broken  ;  and (b)  that  in  a  cert ain  sense  normative  laws  cannot  be  broken.  I  be gin  with  (a) '  T he  natural  law s  of  the  physic ist',  writes  Catlin,  '  are  not  brute  facts,  they are  r ationalizatio ns  of  the  physical  world,  whether  superimposed   by  man  or justified  because  the  world  is  inherently  rational  and  orderly .'  And  he proceeds  to  show  that  natural  l aws  l  can  be  nullified'  when  *  fresh  facts' compel  us  to  rec ast  the  law .  My   reply  to  this  ar gument  is  this.  A  statement intended  as  a  fo rmulation  of  a  law  of  nature  is  certainly  man -made.  W e make  the  hypothesis  that  there   is  a  certain  invariable  regularity ,  i.e.  we describe  the  supposed  regularity  with  the  help  of  a  statement,  the  natural law .  But  as  scientists,  we  are  prepared  to  learn,  from  nature,  that  we  have been  wr ong  ;  we  are  prepare d  to  recast  the  law  if  fresh  facts  which contradict  our  hypothesis  show  that  our  supposed  law  was  no  law ,  since  it has  been   broken.  In  other  wor ds,  by  accepting  nature's  nullification,  the scientist  shows  that  he  accepts  a  hypothesis  only  as  long  as  it  has  not  been falsified  ;  which  is  the  same  as  to  say  that  he  regards  a  law  of  nature  as  a rule  which  cannot  be  broken,  since  he  accepts  the  breaking  of  his  rule  as proof  that  his  rule  did  not  formulate  a  law  of  nature.  Furthermor e  :  although the  hypo thesis  i s  man-made,  we  can  do  nothing  to  prevent  its  falsification. This  shows  that,  by  making  the  hypothesis,  we  have  not  created  the regularity  which  it  is  intended  to   describe.  (b)  '  It  is  not  true',  says  Catlin,  * that  the  criminal  "  breaks  "  the  law  when  he  does  the  forbidden  act  .  .  the statute  does  not  say  :  "  Thou  ca nst  not  "  ;  it  says,  "  Thou  shalt  not,  or  this punishment  will  be  inflicted."  As  command  ',  Catlin  continues,  *  it  may  be broken,  but  as  law ,  in  a  very  real  sense,  it  is  only  broken   when  the punishment  is  not  inflicted.  .  .  So  far  as  the  law  is  perfected  and  its sanctions  executed,  .  .  it  approx imates  to  physical  law .'  The  reply  to  this  is simple.  In  whichever  sense  we  speak  of  '  breaking  '  the  law ,  the  juridical law  can  be  broken  ;  no  verbal  adjustment  can  alter  that.  Le t  us  accept Catlin's  view  that  a  criminal  ca nnot  '  break'  the  law ,  and  that  it  is  only  ' broken'  if  the  criminal  docs  no t  receive  the  punishment  prescribed  by  the law .  But  even  from  this  point  of  view ,  the  law  can  be  broken  ;  for  instance, by  of fic ers  of  the  state  who  ref use  to  punish  the  criminal.  An d  even  in  a state  where  all  sanctions  are,  in  fact,  executed,  the  of ficers  could,  if  they chose,  p revent  such  execution,  and  so  '  break  '  the  law  in  Catlin's  sense. (That  th ey  woul d  thereby  '  break'  the  law  in  the  ordinary  sense  also,  i.e.  that they  wo uld  become  criminals,  and  that  they  might  ultimately  perhaps  be punished,  is  quite  another  question.)  In  other  words  :  A  normative  law  is always  enforce d  by  men  and  by  their  sanctions,  and  it  is  therefore fundamentally  dif ferent  from  a  hypothesis.  The  position  is  really  as  simple as it can be. Legally ,  we  can  enforce  the  suppression  of  murder ,  or  of  acts  of kindness  ;  of  falsity ,  or  of  truth  ;  of  justice  or  of  injustice.  Bu t  we  cannot force the sun to alter its course. No amount of ar gument can bridge this gap. 19  The  '  nature  of  happiness  and  misery  '  is  referred  to   in  the Theaetetus,  1  75c.

T aylor  now  continues  by denying  that  Plato  is  here  at  all  i nterested  in  '  problems  of  the  hygiene  of  the reproduction  '.  But  Plato's  passage  is  thronged  with  allusions  to  these problems,  and  T aylor  himself  admits  two  pages  before  (p.  23)  that  it  is  ' nowhere  suggested'  that  the  Number  '  is  a  determinant  of  anything  but  the  " better  and  worse  births  "  '.  Besides,  not  only  the  passage  in  question  but  the whole  Republic   is  simply  full   of  emphasis  upon  the  '  problems  of  the hygiene  of  reproduction  '.  T aylor's  theory  that  Plato,  when  speaking  of  the  * human  creature'   (or ,  as  T aylor  puts  it,  of  a  '  thing  of  human  generation  '), means  th e  state,   and  that  Plato  wishes  to  allude  to  the  fact  that   the  state  is the  crea tion  of  a  human  lawgiver ,  seems  to  me  without  support  in  Plato's text.  The   whole  passage  begins  w ith  a  reference  to  the  things  of  the  sensible world  in  flux,  to  the  things  that  are  generated  and  that  decay  (s ee  notes  37 and  38  to  this  chapter),  and  more  especially ,  to  living  things,  plants  as  well as  anima ls,  and  to  their  racial  pr oblems.  Besides,  a  thing  '  of  man's  making  ' would,  if  emphasized  by  Plato  in  such  a  context,  mean  an  '  artificial'  thing which  is  inferior  because  it  is  '  twice  removed'  from  reality .  (Cp.  text  to notes 20-23 to this chapter , and the whole T enth Book of the Republic down to  th e  end  of  6o8b.)  Plato  would  never  expect  anybody  to  i nterpret  the phrase  '  a  thing  of  man's  making '  as  meaning  the  perfect,  the  *  n atural'  state ;  rather  he  would  expect  them  to  think  of  something  very  inferior  (like poetry  ;  cp.  note  39  to  chapter  4 ).  The  phrase  which  T aylor  trans lates  '  thing of  h uman  generation'  is  usually  simply  translated  by  *  human  creature',  and this removes all dif ficulties. OceanofPDF .com (3)  Ass uming  that  my  interpretation  of  the  passage  in  question  is correct,  a  suggestion  may  be  m ade  with  the  intention  of  connec ting  Plato's belief in the significance of racial degeneration with his repeated advice that the  number  of  the  members  of  the  ruling  class  should  be  ke pt  constant (advice  that  shows  that  the  socio logist  Plato  understood  the  unsettling  ef fect of  p opulation  increase).  Plato's  w ay  of  thinking,  described  at  th e  end  of  the present  chapter  (cp.  text  to  note  45  ;  and  note  37  to  chapter  8),  especially the  way   he  opposes  The  One  m onarch,  The  Few  timocrats,  to  The  Many who  are  nothing  but  a  mob,  may  have  suggested  to  him  the  be lief  that  an increase in numbers  is  equivalent  to  a  de cline  in  quality .  If  this  hypothesis  is correct,  then  he  may  easily  ha ve  concluded  that  population  increase  is interdependent  with,  or  perhaps   even  caused  by ,  racial  degeneration.  Since population  incre ase  was  in  fact  the  main  cause  of  the  instability  and dissolution  of  the  early  Greek  tribal  societies  (cp.  notes  6,  7 ,  and  63  to chapter  10,  and  text),  this  hypothesis  would  explain  why  Plato  believed  that the  '  real'  caus e  was  racial  degeneration  (in  keeping  with  his  general theories of * nature ', and of * change '). 40  Adam  insists  (note  to  546ds2)  that  we  must  not  translate  *  at  the wrong  t ime  *  but  '  inopportunely'.  I  may  remark  that  my  inter pretation  is quite  independ ent  of  this  question  ;  it  is  fully  compatible  with  ' inopportunely'  or  '  wrongly  '  o r  *  in  the  wrong  way  '.  (Th e  phrase  in question  means,  originally ,  some thing  like  '  contraiy  to  the  proper  measure  ' ; usually it means ' at the wrong time'.) 41  For  Plato's  law  of  social  rev olutions,  see  esp.  note  26  to  chapter  4, and text. 42  The  term  meta-biology  is  us ed  by  G.  B.  Shaw  in  this  sense ,  i.e.  as denoting  a  kind  of  religion.  (Cp.  the  preface  to  Back  to  Methuselah  ;  see also note 66 to chapter 12.) 43 Cp.

Institu- tiones,  I I,  1,2;  I,  2,  2).  It  is  used  by  Thomas  Aquinas,  also  (Summa,  II,  91, 2).  The  confusing  use  of  the  term  '  natural  law  '  instead  of  '  natural  right'  by modern  Thomis ts  is  to  be  regretted,  as  well  as  the  small  emphasis  they  put upon equalitarianism. 17  The  monistic  tendency  which  first  led  to  the  attempt  to  interpret norms  a s  natural  has  recently  led  to  the  opposite  attempt,  namely ,  to interpret  natural  laws  as  conventional.  This  (physical)  type  of conventionalism  has  been  base d,  by  Poincare",  on  the  recognition  of  the conventional  or  verbal  character   of  definitions.  Poincare,  and  more  recently Eddington,  point  out  that  we  define  natural  entities  by  the  laws  they  obey . From  th is  the  conclusion  is  dra wn  that  these  laws,  i.e.  the  laws  of  nature, are  definitions,  i.e.  verbal  conventions.  Cp.  Eddington's  letter  in  Nature  148 (1941),  141  :  *  The  elements  '  (o f  physical  theory)  *  .  .  can  only  be  defined  . .  b y  the  laws  they  obey  ;  so  that  we  find  ourselves  chasing  our  own  tails  in  a purely  formal  system.'—An  a nalysis  and  a  criticism  of  th is  form  of conventionalism can be found in my Logik der Forschung, esp. pp. 40 fF . 18  ( i)  The  hop e  of  getting  so me  ar gument  or  theory  to  sh are  our responsibility  is,  I  believe,  one  o f  the  basic  motives  of  *  scientific'  ethics.  * Scientific  '  ethics  is  in  its  absolute  barrenness  one  of  the  most  amazing  of social  ph enomena.  What  does  it  aim  at  ?  At  telling  us  what  we  ought  to  do, i.e.  a t  co nstructing  a  code  of  norms  upon  a  scientific  basis,  so  t hat  we  need only  look  up  th e  index  of  the  code  if  we  are  faced  with  a  dif ficult  moral decision  ?  This  would  clearly  be  absurd  ;  quite  apart  from  the  fact  that  if  it could  be   achieved,  it  would  dest roy  all  personal  responsibility  and  therefore all  e thics.  Or  would  it  give  scientific  criteria  of  the  truth  and  fals ity  of  moral judgements,  i.e.  of  judgements  involving  such  terms  as  '  good  '  or  *  bad  '  ? But  it  is  clear  that  moral  judgements  arc  absolutely  irreleva nt.  Only  a scandalmonger  is  interested  in  judging  people  or  their  actions  ;  '  judge  not' appears  to  some  of  us  one  of  the  fundamental  and  much  too  little appreciated  laws  of  humanitarian  ethics.  (W e  may  have  to  disarm  and  to imprison  a  criminal  in  order  to  prevent  him  from  repeating  his  crimes,  but too much of moral judgement and especially of moral indignation is Always a  sign  of  hypocrisy  and  pharisaism.)  Thus  an  ethics  of  moral  judgements would  be  not  only  irrelevant  but  indeed  an  immoral  af fa ir .  The  all- importance  of  moral  problems  r ests,  of  course,  on  the  fact  that  we  can  act with  intelligent  foresight,  and  that  we  can  ask  ourselves  what  our  aims ought to be, i.e. how we ought to act. Nearly  all  moral  philosophers  w ho  have  dealt  with  the  problem  of  how we  ought  to  act  (with  the  possible  exception  of  Kant)  have  tried  to  answer  it either  by   referen ce  to  '  human  nature'  (as  did  even  Kant,  when  he  referred  to human  reason)  or  to  the  nature  of  *  the  good  '.  The  first  of  these  ways  leads nowhere,  since  all  actions  possi ble  to  us  are  founded  upon  '  hum an  nature', so that the problem of ethics could also be put by asking which elements  in  human  nature  I  ought  to  follow  and  to  develop,  an d  which sides  I  ought  to  suppress  or  to  control.  But  the  second  of  thes e  ways  also leads  nowhere  ;  for  given  an  analysis  of'  the  good  '  in  form  o f  a  sentence like  :  '  The  good  is  such  and  such  '  (or  '  such  and  such  is  good  ' ),  we  would always  have  to  ask  :  What  about  it  ?  Why  should  this  concern  me  ?  Only  if the  w ord  '  good  *  is  used  in  an  ethical  sense,  i.e.  only  if  it  is  used  to  mean  * that  whi ch  I  ought  to  do  ',  could  I  derive  from  the  information  '  x  is  good  ' the  conclusion  that  I  ought  to  do  x.  In  other  words,  if  the  word  good  is  to have  any  ethical  significance  at   all,  it  must  be  defined

of  Book  VIII can  still  be  surpassed,  namely ,  a s  Adam  says,  by  the  city  of  Books  V -VII— the ideal city in heaven.) In  h is  book,  Pl ato's  Cosmology ,  pp.  6  f f.,  Cornford  reconstructs  the outlines  and  contents  of  Plato's   unfinished  trilogy ,  T imaeus  —  Critias  — Hermocrates,  an d  shows  how  th ey  are  related  to  the  historical  parts  of  the Laws  (B ook  III) .  This  reconstruction  is,  I  think,  a  valuable  corroboration  of my  theo ry  that  Plato's  view  of  t he  world  was  fundamentally  historical,  and that  his  interest  in  *  how  it  generated  '  (and  how  it  decays)  is  linked  with  his theory  of  Ideas,  and  indeed  based  on  it.  But  if  that  is  so,  then  there  is  no reason  why  we  should  assume  t hat  the  later  books  of  the  Republic  '  started from  the  question  how  it'  (i.e.  th e  city)  *  might  be  realized  in  the  future  and sketched  its  possible  decline  th rough  lower  forms  of  polities'  (Cornford, op.cit.,  6  ;  italic s  mine)  ;  but  we  should,  especially  in  view  o f  the  close parallelism  betw een  the  third  bo ok  of  the  Laws  and  the  eighth  book  of  the Republic,  consid er  it  as  a  simplified  historical  sketch  of  the  actual  decline of  the  ideal  city  of  the  past,  a nd  as  an  explanation  of  the  origin  of  the existing  states,  analogous  to  the  greater  task  set  by  Plato  for  himself  in  the T imaeus, in the unfinished trilogy , and in the Laws. (sj) In connection with my remark, later in the paragraph, that Plato *  certain ly  knew   that  he  did  not  possess  the  necessary  data',   see  for instance Laws, 683d, and England's note to 683d2. (3)  T p  m y  rema rk  further  on  in  the  paragraph,  that  Plato  recognized  the Cretan  a nd  Spar tan  societies  as  petrified  or  arrested  (and  to  the  remark  in the  next   paragraph  that  Plato's  b est  state  is  not  only  a  class  state  but  a  caste state)  the  following  may  be  added.  (Cp.  also  note  20  to  this  chapter ,  and  24 to chapter 10.) In Laws, 79 yd (in the introduction to the ' important pronouncement', as England  calls  it,  quoted  in  the  text  to  note  3  to  this  chapter)  Pla to  makes  it perfectly clear that his Cretan and Spartan interlocutors are aware of the *  arreste d'  character  of  their  s ocial  institutions  ;  Clenias,  the  Cretan interlocutor ,  emphasizes  that  he  is  anxious  to  listen  to  any  defence  of  the archaic  character  of  a  state.  A  little  later  (799a),  and  in  the  sam e  context,  a direct  reference  is  made  to  the  Egyptian  method  of  arresting  the development  of  institutions  ;  surely  a  clear  indication  that  Plato  recognized a  t endency  in  Cr ete  and  Sparta  p arallel  to  that  of  Egypt,  namely ,  to  arrest  all social change. In  this  context,  a  passage  in  the   T imaeus  (see  especially  24a-b)  seems important.  In  this  passage,  Plato   tries  to  show  (a)  that  a  class  division  very similar  to  that  of  the  Republic  was  established  in  Athens  at  a  v ery  ancient period  o f  its  pre-historical  development,  and  (b)  that  these  institutions  were closely  akin  to  t he  caste  system  of  Egypt  (whose  arrested  caste  institutions he  assum es  to  have  derived  from  his  ancient  Athenian  state).   Thus  Plato himself  acknowl edges  by  implication  that  the  ideal  ancient  and  perfect  state of  t he  Republic  is  a  caste  s tate.  It  is  interesting  that   G  rantor ,  first commentator  on   the  T imaeus,  reports,  only  two  generations  after  Plato,  that Plato  h ad  been  accused  of  d eserting  the  Athenian  tradition,  and  of becoming  a  disciple  of  the  E gyptians.

Carnap,  Introduction to Semantics, 1942, and note 23 to chapter 8. 30  The   theory  that  while  th e  physical  sciences  are  based  on  a methodological  nominalism,  the  social  sciences  must  adopt  essentialist  (' realistic  ')  methods,  has  been  made  clear  to  me  by  K.  Polanyi  (in  1925)  ;  he pointed  out,  at  that  time,  that  a   reform  of  the  methodology  of  the  social sciences  might  conceivably  be  achieved  by  abandoning  this  theory .—The theory  is  held,  to  some  extent,  by  most  sociologists,  esp.  by  J.  S.  Mill  (for instance,  Logic,   VI,  ch.  VI,  2  ;  see  also  his  historicist  formulat ions,  e.g.  in VI,  ch.  X,  2,  last  paragraph  :  '  The  fundamental  problem  .  .  o f  the  social science  is  to  find   the  laws  according  to  which  any  state  of  socie ty  produces the  s tate  which  succeeds  it  .  .'),  K.  Marx  (see  below)  ;  M.  W eb er  (cp.,  for example,  his  definitions  in  the  beginning  of  Methodische  Grundlagen  der Soziologie,  in  W irtschqft  und  Gesellschaft,  I,  and  in  Ges.  Aufsaetze  zur W issenschaftslehre).  G.  Simmel,  A.  V ierkandt,  R.  M.  Maclver ,  and  many more.—The  philosophical  expression  of  all  these  tendencies  is  E.  HusserFs '  Phaenomenology',  a  systematic  revival  of  the  methodological  essentialism of Plato and Aristotle. (See also chapter n, esp. note 44.) The  opposite,  the  nominalist  attitude  in  sociology ,  can  be  developed,  I think, only as a technological theory of social institutions. In  th is  context,  I  may  mention  h ow  I  came  to  trace  historicism  back  to Plato  an d  Herac litus.  In  analysing  historicism,  I  found  that  it  needs  what  I call  now   methodological  essentialism  ;  i.e.  I  saw  that  the  typical  ar guments in  fa vour  of  esse ntialism  are  bound  up  with  historicism  (cp.  my  Poverty  of Historicism).  Th is  led  me  to  consider  the*  history  of  essentialism.  I  was struck  b y  the  parallelism  betwee n  Aristotle's  report  and  the  analysis  which  I had  carr ied  out  originally  withou t  any  reference  to  Platonism.  In   this  way ,  I was reminded of the roles of both Heraclitus and Plato in this development. 31  I   am  alluding   mainly  to  R.  H.  S.  Grossman,  Plato  T o-day  (19 37),  the first  boo k  I  have  found  to  contain  a  political  interpretation  of  Pl ato  which  is partly similar to my own. See also notes 2-3 to chapter 6, and text. NOTES T O CHAPTER 4 1 Cp. Republic, 6o8e. See also note 2 (2) to this chapter . 2  (i)  W ith  the  Platonic  theory ,  Aristotle  contrasts  his  own,  according  to which  th e  '  good  '  thing  is  not  th e  starting  point,  but  rather  the  end  or  aim  of change,  since  '  good  '  means  a  t hing  aimed  at—  the  final  cause   of  change. Thus  he  says  of   the  Platonists,  i.e.  of*  those  who  believe  in  Forms  ',  that they  '  do  not  speak  as  if  anything   came  to  pass  for  the  sake  of  these  *  (i.e.  of things which are *  good  ')  *  but  as  if  all  movement  started  from  them  '.  And  he  points  out that *  good  '  means  therefore  to  the  P latonists  not'  a  cause  qua  good  ',  i.e.  an aim,  but  that  *  it  is  only  incidentally  a  good'.  Cp.  Metaphysics,  gSSbi  and  8 f f.  (T his  criticism  sounds  as  if  A ristotle  had  sometimes  held  views  similar to  those  of  Speusippus,  which  is  indeed  Zeller's  opinion  ;  see  note  n  to chapter 1 1. (2)   C  oncerning  the  movement  towards  corruption,  mentioned  in  the  text in  this  paragraph ,  and  its  general  significance  in  the  Platonic  philosophy ,  we must  keep  in  mind  the  general  opposition  between  the  world  of  unchanging things  or  Ideas,  and  the  world  of  sensible  things  in  flux.  Plato  often expresses  this  opposition  as  one  between  the  world  of  unchanging  things and  the  world  of  corruptible  things,  or  between  things  that  are  generated and  those  that  d egenerate,  etc.  ;  see,  for  instance,  Republic,  485 a/b,  quoted in  no te  2 6  (i)  to  chapter  3  and  in  text  to  note  33  to  chapter  8  ;  and  Republic, 5463,  quoted  in  text  to  note  37  to  chapter  5  :  *  All  things  that  have  been generated  must  degenerate'  (or  d ecay).  That  this  problem  of  the   generation and  corruption  of  the  world  of  things  in  flux  was  an  important  part  of  the Platonic School tradition is indicated by  t he  fact  that  Aristotle  devot ed  a  separate  treatise  to  this  p roblem. Another  interest ing  indication  is  the  way  in  which  Aristotle  t alked  about these  ma tters  in  the  introduction   to  his  Politics,  contained  in  the  concluding sentences  of  the  Nicomachian  E thics  (i  i8ib/i5)  :  *  W e  shall  tr y  to  ...  find what  it  is  that  pr eserves  or  corrupts  the  cities  .  .  .'

(682e/683a).  So   far  we  have  heard  nothing  about  the  man ner  of  this settlement,  and  there  follows  a t  once  a  further  digression  (Pl ato  himself speaks  about  the  *  roundabout  track  of  the  ar gument')  until  we  get ultimately (in 683c/d) the * hint' mentioned in the text ; see (b). (b)  The  statement  in  the  text  that  we  get  a  hint  that  the  Dorian  * settlement  '  in  th e  Peloponnese  was  in  fact  a  violent  subjugation,  refers  to the  Laws  (683c/d),  where  Pla to  introduces  what  are  actually  his  first historical  remar ks  on  Sparta.  He  says  that  he  begins  at  the  time  when  the whole  o f  the  Peloponnese  was  *  practically  subjugated  '  by  the  Dorians.  In the  M enexenus  (whose  genuineness  can  hardly  be  doubted  ;  cp.  note  35  to chapter  10)  there  is  in  245C  an  allusion  to  the  fact  that  the  Pelo ponnesians were ' immigrants from abroad ' (as Grote puts it : cp. his Plato, III, p. 5). (c)  In  the  Republic  (369^  the  cit y  is  founded  by  workers  with  a  view  to the  a dvantages  of  a  division  of   labour  and  of  co-operation,  in   accordance with the contract theory . (d)  But  later  (in  Rep.,  4i5d/e  ;  see  the  quotation  in  the  text ,  to  this paragraph)  we  get  a  descriptio n  of  the  triumphant  invasion  of  a  warrior class  of  somewh at  mysterious  origin—the  '  earthborn'.  The  decisive  passage of  th is  description  states  that  the  earthborn  must  look  round  to  find  for  their camp  the  most  suitable  spot  (literally)  '  for  keeping  down  those  within',  i.e., for  k eeping  down  those  already  living  in  the  city ,  i.e.,  for  keepin g  down  the inhabitants. (e)  I n  th e  States man  (2713,  f.)  t hese  '  earthborn'  are  identified  with  the very early nomad hill shepherds of the pre-settlement period. (/)  T o  sum  up  it  seems  that  Pla to  had  a  fairly  clear  idea  of  the   Dorian conquest,  which  he  preferred,  for  obvious  reasons,  to  veil  in  mystery .

(682e/683a).  So   far  we  have  heard  nothing  about  the  man ner  of  this settlement,  and  there  follows  a t  once  a  further  digression  (Pl ato  himself speaks  about  the  *  roundabout  track  of  the  ar gument')  until  we  get ultimately (in 683c/d) the * hint' mentioned in the text ; see (b). (b)  The  statement  in  the  text  that  we  get  a  hint  that  the  Dorian  * settlement  '  in  th e  Peloponnese  was  in  fact  a  violent  subjugation,  refers  to the  Laws  (683c/d),  where  Pla to  introduces  what  are  actually  his  first historical  remar ks  on  Sparta.  He  says  that  he  begins  at  the  time  when  the whole  o f  the  Peloponnese  was  *  practically  subjugated  '  by  the  Dorians.  In the  M enexenus  (whose  genuineness  can  hardly  be  doubted  ;  cp.  note  35  to chapter  10)  there  is  in  245C  an  allusion  to  the  fact  that  the  Pelo ponnesians were ' immigrants from abroad ' (as Grote puts it : cp. his Plato, III, p. 5). (c)  In  the  Republic  (369^  the  cit y  is  founded  by  workers  with  a  view  to the  a dvantages  of  a  division  of   labour  and  of  co-operation,  in   accordance with the contract theory . (d)  But  later  (in  Rep.,  4i5d/e  ;  see  the  quotation  in  the  text ,  to  this paragraph)  we  get  a  descriptio n  of  the  triumphant  invasion  of  a  warrior class  of  somewh at  mysterious  origin—the  '  earthborn'.  The  decisive  passage of  th is  description  states  that  the  earthborn  must  look  round  to  find  for  their camp  the  most  suitable  spot  (literally)  '  for  keeping  down  those  within',  i.e., for  k eeping  down  those  already  living  in  the  city ,  i.e.,  for  keepin g  down  the inhabitants. (e)  I n  th e  States man  (2713,  f.)  t hese  '  earthborn'  are  identified  with  the very early nomad hill shepherds of the pre-settlement period. (/)  T o  sum  up  it  seems  that  Pla to  had  a  fairly  clear  idea  of  the   Dorian conquest,  which  he  preferred,  for  obvious  reasons,  to  veil  in  mystery .  It  also seems  th at  there   was  a  traditio n  that  the  conquering  war  hord es  were  of nomad descent.

the  law  (III,  80,  6)  ;  see  also  note  14  to  this  chapter .  The passage  from  Herodotus,  which   influenced  Plato  in  other  wa ys  also  (cp. note  24  to  chapt er  4),  is  one  which  Plato  ridicules  in  the  Republ ic  just  as  he ridicules Pericles' oration ; rp. note 14 to chapter 4 and 34 to chapter 10. 18  E ven  the  naturalist  Aristotle  does  not  always  refer  to  this  nat uralistic version  of  equalitarianism  ;  for  instance,  his  formulation  of  the  principles  of democracy  in  Politics,  i^ijb  (cp.  note  9  to  this  chapter ,  and  te xt)  is  quite independent  of  it.  But  it  is  perha ps  even  more  interesting  that  in  the  Gor gias in  which  the  opposition  of  nature  and  convention  plays  such  an  important role,  Plato  presents  equalitarian ism  without  burdening  it  with  the  dubious theory  of  the  na tural  equality  of  all  men  (see  4886  /48ga,  quoted  in  note  14 to this chapter , and 483d, 4843, and 5083). 19 Cp. Menexenus, 238e/23ga. The passage immediately follows a clear allusion  to  Pericles'  oration  (viz.,  to  the  second  sentence  quoted  in  the  text to  note  17,  in  this  chapter).—It  seems  not  improbable  that  the  reiteration  of the  term  '  equal  birth  '  in  that  passage  is  meant  as  a  scornful  allu sion  to  the  ' low  *  birth  of  Pericles'  and  Aspasia's  sons,  who  were  rec ognized  as Athenian citizens only  by   special  legislation  in  429  B.C.  (Cp.  E.  Meyer ,  Gesch.  d. Altertums, vol. IV , p. 14, note to No. 392, and p. 323, No. 558.) (It  has  been  held  (even  by  Grote  ;  cp.  his  Plato,  III,  p.  1 1)  that  Plato  in the  M enexenus,  '  in  his  own  rhetorical  discourse,  .  .  drops  the  iro nical  vein  ', i.e.  that  the  middle  part  of  the  Menexenus,  from  which  the  quotation  in  the text  is  taken,  is  not  meant  ironic ally .  But  in  view  of  the  quoted  passage  on equality ,  and  in  view  of  Plato's  open  scorn  in  the  Republic  when  he  deals with  this  point  (cp.  note  14  to  this  chapter),  this  opinion  se ems  to  me untenable.  And  it  appears  to  me  equally  impossible  to  doubt  the  ironical character  of  the  passage  immediately  preceding  the  one  quoted  in  the  text where  Plato  says  of  Athens  (cp.  238c/d)  :  '  In  this  time  as  well  as   at  present  . .  ou r  government  was  always  an  aristocracy  .  .  ;  though  it  is  sometimes called  a  democracy ,  it  is  really  an  aristocracy ,  that  is  to  say ,  a  rule  of  the best,  with  the  approval  of  the   many  .  .'  In  view  of  Plato' s  hatred  of democracy ,  this  description  needs  no  further  comment .—For  the genuineness of the Menexenus, cp. also note 35 to chapter 10. 20 Laws, 757a ; cp. the whole passage 7573-0. (1)  F or  what  I  call  the  standard  objection  against  cqualitarianism,  cp. also  Laws,  744b,  f f.  'It  would  b e  excellent  if  everybody  could  .  .  have  all things  eq ual  ;  but  since  this  is  im possible  .  .',  etc.  The  passage  is  especially interesting  in  view  of  the  fact  th at  Plato  is  often  described  as  an  enemy  of plutocracy by many writers who judge him only by the Republic. But in this important  passag e  of  the  Laws  (i.e.  744b,  f f.)  Plato  demands  that  *  political of fices,  and  contributions,  as  well  as  distributions  of  bounties,  should  be proportional  to  the  value  of  a  ci tizen's  wealth.  And  they  should  depend  not only  on  his  virtue  or  that  of  his  ancestors  or  on  the  size  and  attractiveness  of his  body ,  but  a4so  upon  his  wealth  or  his  poverty .  In  this  way ,   a  man  will receive  honours  and  of fices  as  equitably  as  possible,  i.e.  in  proportion  to  his wealth,  although  according  to  a  principle  of  unequal  distribution.'  The  basic idea  of  this  attitude,  viz.,  that  it  is  unjust  to  treat  unequals  equ ally ,  can  be found,  in   a  passing  remark,  as  e arly  as  the  Protagoras  (337a)  ;  but  Plato  did not make much use of the idea before writing the Laws. (2)  F or  A ristotle's  elaboration  of   these  ideas,  cp.  esp.  his  Politics,  III,  9, i,  i28 oa  (see  also  III,  12-13,  12820-1284^,  where  he  writes  :  *  A ll  men  cling to  justice  of  some  kind,  but  their  conceptions  are  imperfect,  and  do  not embrace  the  whole  Idea.  For  ex ample,  justice  is  thought  (by  de mocrats)  to be  equality  ;  and  so  it  is,  although  it  is  not  equality  for  all,  but  only  for equals.  And  justice  is  thought  ( by  oligarchs)  to  be  inequality  ;  and  so  it  is, although it is not inequality for all, but only for unequals.' (3)  A gainst  all  this  anti-equalit arianism,  I  maintain,  with  Kant,  that  it must  be  the  principle  of  all  morality  that  no  man  should  consider  himself more  valuable  than  any  other

of each  can  co-exist  with  that  of  all  others  '.  (Critique  of  Pure  Reason  a  ,  373)  ; see  also  his  Theory  of  Right,  where  he  says  :  *  Right  (or  justice)  is  the  sum total  of  the  conditions  which  are  necessary  for  everybody's  free  choice  to co-exist  with  that  of  everybody  else,  in  accordance  with  a  general  law  of liberty .'  Kant  believed  that  this  was  the  aim  pursued  by  Plato  in  the Republic  ;  from  which  we  m ay  see  that  Kant  was  one  of  the  many philosophers  who  were  either  deceived  by  Plato  or  who  ideali zed  him  by imputing  to  him  their  own  humanitarian  ideas.  I  may  remark,  in  this connection,  that  Kant's  ardent  liberalism  is  very  little  appreciated  in  English and  Am erican  writings  on  political  philosophy  (in  spite  of  Hastie's  Kant's Principles  of  Politics).  He  is  only  too  often  regarded  as  a  fo rerunner  of Hegel,  in  spite  of  the  fact  that  he  recognized  in  the  romanticism  of  both Herder  and  Fichte  a  doctrine  diametrically  opposed  to  his  own  ;  he  would have  strongly  resented  the  claim  of  the  Hegelian  school  that  he  was  a forerunner  of  Hegel.  But  the  tremendous  influence  of  Hegelianism  led  to  a wide acceptance of this view which is, I believe, completely mistaken. 8 Cp. text to notes 32/33 to chapter 5. •  Cp .  text  to  notes  25  to  29,  chapter  5.

Barker  states  (p.  176  f.)  that  *  Platonic  Justice  '  is  *  social  justice',  and correctly  emphasizes  its  holistic   nature.  He  mentions  (178  f,)  the  possible criticism  that  this  formula  does   '  not  .  .  touch  the  essence  of  what  men generally  mean  by  justice  *,  i.e .  '  a  principle  for  dealing  with  the  clash  of wills  ',  i.e.  justice  as  pertaining  to  individuals.  But  he  thinks  that  '  such  an objection  is  beside  the  point  *,  and  that  Plato's  idea  is  '  not  a  matter  of  law' but  *  a  conception  of  social  morality  '  (i  79)  ;  and  he  goes  on  t o  assert  that this  trea tment  of   justice  corresponded,  in  a  way ,  to  the  current  Greek  ideas of  ju stice  :  "  Nor  was  Plato,  in   conceiving  justice  in  this  sen se,  very  far removed  from  the  current  ideas  in  Greece  '.

og,  and  the  human  cattle.  In  spite  of  these   points  of agreement,  there  is  even  in  t he  interpretation  of  Plato  a  f undamental disagreement  between  T oynbee's  views  and  my  own.  T oynbee  regards Plato's  b est  state   as  a  typical  (reactionary)  Utopia,  while  I  interp ret  its  major part,  in  connecti on  with  what  I  consider  as  Plato's  general  theory   of  change, as  an   att empt  to  reconstruct  a  primitive  form  of  society .  Nor  do  I  think  that T oynbee  would  agree  with  my  interpretation  of  Plato's  story  o f  the  period prior  to  the  settlement,  and  of  the  settlement  itself,  outlined  in  t his  note  and the  text  ;  for  T oynbee  says  (op.  cit.,  vol.  Ill,  80)  that  '  the  Spa rtan  society was  not  of  nomadic  origin  *.  T o ynbee  strongly  emphasize^  (op .  cit.,  Ill,  50 f f.)  the  peculiar  character  of  Spartan  society ,  which,  he  says,  was  arrested  in its  d evelopment   owing  to  a  superhuman  ef fort  to  keep  down  their  *  human cattle  '.  But  I  think  that  this  emphasis  on  the  peculiar  situation  of  Sparta makes  it  dif ficult  to  understand   the  similarities  between  the  in stitutions  of Sparta  and  Crete  which  Plato  found  so  striking  (Rep.,  544C  ;  Laws,  683a). These,  I   believe ,  can  be  explain ed  only  as  arrested  forms  of  very  ancient tribal  institution s,  which  must  b e  considerably  older  than  the  e f fort  of  the Spartans  in  the  second  Messeni an  war  (about  650-620  B.C.  ;  cp.  T oynbee, op.  cit.,  Ill,  53).  Since  the  conditions  of  the  survival  of  these  institutions were  so  very  dif ferent  in  the  two  localities,  their  similarity  is  a  strong ar gument  in  favour  of  their  bei ng  primitive  and  against  an  exp lanation  of their arrestment by a factor which af fects only one of them. 33  T he  f act  that  education  is  in  Plato's  state  a  class  prerogative  has  been overlooked  by  some  enthusiastic  educationists  who  credit  Plato  with  the idea of  m aking  education  independe nt  of  financial  means  ;  they  do  not  see that  the  evil  is  the  class  prerogative  as  such,  and  that  it  is  comparatively unimportant  whether  this  prer ogative  is  based  upon  the  possession  of money  or  upon  any  other  criterion  by  which  membership  of  the  ruling  class is determined. Cp. notes 12 and 13 to chapter 7, and text. 34  Cp.  Republic,  46oc.  (See  also  note  31  to  this  chapter .)  Re garding Plato's  recomme ndation  of  infanticide,  see  Adam,  op.  cit.,  vol.  I,  p.  299, note  to  46oci8,  and  pp.  357  f f.  A lthough  Adam  rightly  insists  that  Plato  was in  fa vour  of  infanticide,  and  although  he  rejects  as  '  irrelevant'  a ll  attempts  ' to  acqui t  Plato  of  sanctioning'  such  a  dreadful  practice,  he  tries  to  excuse Plato  by  pointing  out  '  that  the  practice  was  widely  prevalent  in  ancient Greece'.  But  it  was  not  so  in  Athens.  Plato  chooses  throughout  t o  prefer  the ancient  Spartan  barbarism  and  racialism  to  the  enlightenment  of  Pericles' Athens  ;  and  for   this  choice  he  must  be  held  responsible.  For  a   hypothesis explaining  the  Spartan  practice,  see  note  7  to  chapter  10  (and  text)  ;  see  also the cross references given there.

The  problem  of  blending  opposite  ' natures  '  (or  even  Forms  ;  cp.  notes  18-20,  chapter  5,  and  text  and  note  39  to chapter  8)  is  one  of  Plato's  favourite  topics.

Plat o  himself  treats  Crete  with  som e  irony because  of  its  b arbarous  ignor ance  of  literature.  This  ignorance  extends even  to  Homer ,  whom  the  Cretan  interlocutor  does  not  know ,  and  of  whom he  s ays  :  '  foreign  poets  are  very   little  read  by  Cretans  '.

(682e/683a).  So   far  we  have  heard  nothing  about  the  man ner  of  this settlement,  and  there  follows  a t  once  a  further  digression  (Pl ato  himself speaks  about  the  *  roundabout  track  of  the  ar gument')  until  we  get ultimately (in 683c/d) the * hint' mentioned in the text ; see (b). (b)  The  statement  in  the  text  that  we  get  a  hint  that  the  Dorian  * settlement  '  in  th e  Peloponnese  was  in  fact  a  violent  subjugation,  refers  to the  Laws  (683c/d),  where  Pla to  introduces  what  are  actually  his  first historical  remar ks  on  Sparta.  He  says  that  he  begins  at  the  time  when  the whole  o f  the  Peloponnese  was  *  practically  subjugated  '  by  the  Dorians.  In the  M enexenus  (whose  genuineness  can  hardly  be  doubted  ;  cp.  note  35  to chapter  10)  there  is  in  245C  an  allusion  to  the  fact  that  the  Pelo ponnesians were ' immigrants from abroad ' (as Grote puts it : cp. his Plato, III, p. 5). (c)  In  the  Republic  (369^  the  cit y  is  founded  by  workers  with  a  view  to the  a dvantages  of  a  division  of   labour  and  of  co-operation,  in   accordance with the contract theory . (d)  But  later  (in  Rep.,  4i5d/e  ;  see  the  quotation  in  the  text ,  to  this paragraph)  we  get  a  descriptio n  of  the  triumphant  invasion  of  a  warrior class  of  somewh at  mysterious  origin—the  '  earthborn'.  The  decisive  passage of  th is  description  states  that  the  earthborn  must  look  round  to  find  for  their camp  the  most  suitable  spot  (literally)  '  for  keeping  down  those  within',  i.e., for  k eeping  down  those  already  living  in  the  city ,  i.e.,  for  keepin g  down  the inhabitants. (e)  I n  th e  States man  (2713,  f.)  t hese  '  earthborn'  are  identified  with  the very early nomad hill shepherds of the pre-settlement period. (/)  T o  sum  up  it  seems  that  Pla to  had  a  fairly  clear  idea  of  the   Dorian conquest,  which  he  preferred,  for  obvious  reasons,  to  veil  in  mystery .  It  also seems  th at  there   was  a  traditio n  that  the  conquering  war  hord es  were  of nomad descent. (2)  W ith  the  remark  later  in  the  text  in  this  paragraph  regarding   Plato's  ' continuous  emp hasis  '  on  the  fact  that  ruling  is  shepherdin g,  cp.,  for instance,  the  following  passages  :  Republic,  3430,  where  the  idea  is introduced  ;  345C  f.,  where,  in  form  of  the  simile  of  the  good  shepherd,  it becomes  one  of  the  central  topics  of  the  investigation  ;  375a~376b,  4043, 44od,  45 10-6,  45ga~46oc,  and  466c-d  (quoted  in  note  30  to  chapter  5), where  the  auxiliaries  are  likened  to  sheep-dogs  and  where  their  breeding and  educ ation  is   discussed  accordingly  ;  4i6a,  f f.,  where  the  problem  of  the wolves  without  and  within  the  state  is  introduced  ;  cp.  furthermore,  the Statesman,  where  the  idea  is  continued  over  many  pages,  esp.  26id-276d. W ith  regard  to  the  Laws,  I  ma y  refer  to  the  passage  (6946),  where  Plato says  of  Cyrus  that  he  had  acquired  for  his  sons  '  cattle  and  shee p  and  many herds of men and other animals '. (Cp. also Laws, 735, and Theaet., i74d.) (3) W ith all this, cp. also A. J. T oynbee, A Study of History , esp. vol. Ill, pp.  3 2  (n.  i),  where  A.  H.  L ybye r ,  The  Government  of  the  Ottoman  Empire, etc.,  is  quoted,  33  (n.  2),  50-10 0  ;  see  more  especially  his  remark  on  the conquering  nomads  (p.  22)  who  *  deal  with  .  .  .  men  ',  and  on  Plato's  human watchdogs'  (p.  94,  n.  2).  I  have  been  much  stimulated  by  T oynbee's  brilliant ideas  and  much  encouraged  by  many  of  his  remarks  which  I  take  as corroborating  m y  interpretations ,  and  which  I  can  value  the  more  highly  the more  T oynbee's  and  my  fundam ental  assumptions  seem  to  disagree.  I  also owe  to  T oynbee  a  number  of  t erms  used  in  my  text,  especially  '  human cattle ', * human herd ' and ' human watch-dog '. T oynbee's  Study   of  History  is,  from  my  point  of  view ,  a  model  of  what  I call  hist oricism  ;  I  need  not  say  much  more  to  express  my  f undamental disagreement  with  it;  and  a  number  of  special  points  of  disagreement  will be  discussed  at  various  places  (cp.  notes  43  and  45  (2)  to  this  chapter ,  notes 7  and  8  to  chapter  10,  and  c hapter  24).  But  it  contains  a  wealth  of interesting  and  stimulating  ideas.  Regarding  Plato,  T oynbee  emphasizes  a number of points in which I can follow him, especially that Plato's best state is  inspired  by  his  experience  of   social  revolution  and  by  his  wish  to  arrest all  c hange,  and  that  it  is  a  kind   of  arrested  Sparta  (which  itse lf  was  also arrested).  T oynb ee  also  stresses  the  ideas  of  the  shepherd  of  men,  of  the human  sheep-d

of  Book  VIII can  still  be  surpassed,  namely ,  a s  Adam  says,  by  the  city  of  Books  V -VII— the ideal city in heaven.) In  h is  book,  Pl ato's  Cosmology ,  pp.  6  f f.,  Cornford  reconstructs  the outlines  and  contents  of  Plato's   unfinished  trilogy ,  T imaeus  —  Critias  — Hermocrates,  an d  shows  how  th ey  are  related  to  the  historical  parts  of  the Laws  (B ook  III) .  This  reconstruction  is,  I  think,  a  valuable  corroboration  of my  theo ry  that  Plato's  view  of  t he  world  was  fundamentally  historical,  and that  his  interest  in  *  how  it  generated  '  (and  how  it  decays)  is  linked  with  his theory  of  Ideas,  and  indeed  based  on  it.  But  if  that  is  so,  then  there  is  no reason  why  we  should  assume  t hat  the  later  books  of  the  Republic  '  started from  the  question  how  it'  (i.e.  th e  city)  *  might  be  realized  in  the  future  and sketched  its  possible  decline  th rough  lower  forms  of  polities'  (Cornford, op.cit.,  6  ;  italic s  mine)  ;  but  we  should,  especially  in  view  o f  the  close parallelism  betw een  the  third  bo ok  of  the  Laws  and  the  eighth  book  of  the Republic,  consid er  it  as  a  simplified  historical  sketch  of  the  actual  decline of  the  ideal  city  of  the  past,  a nd  as  an  explanation  of  the  origin  of  the existing  states,  analogous  to  the  greater  task  set  by  Plato  for  himself  in  the T imaeus, in the unfinished trilogy , and in the Laws. (sj) In connection with my remark, later in the paragraph, that Plato *  certain ly  knew   that  he  did  not  possess  the  necessary  data',   see  for instance Laws, 683d, and England's note to 683d2. (3)  T p  m y  rema rk  further  on  in  the  paragraph,  that  Plato  recognized  the Cretan  a nd  Spar tan  societies  as  petrified  or  arrested  (and  to  the  remark  in the  next   paragraph  that  Plato's  b est  state  is  not  only  a  class  state  but  a  caste state)  the  following  may  be  added.  (Cp.  also  note  20  to  this  chapter ,  and  24 to chapter 10.) In Laws, 79 yd (in the introduction to the ' important pronouncement', as England  calls  it,  quoted  in  the  text  to  note  3  to  this  chapter)  Pla to  makes  it perfectly clear that his Cretan and Spartan interlocutors are aware of the *  arreste d'  character  of  their  s ocial  institutions  ;  Clenias,  the  Cretan interlocutor ,  emphasizes  that  he  is  anxious  to  listen  to  any  defence  of  the archaic  character  of  a  state.  A  little  later  (799a),  and  in  the  sam e  context,  a direct  reference  is  made  to  the  Egyptian  method  of  arresting  the development  of  institutions  ;  surely  a  clear  indication  that  Plato  recognized a  t endency  in  Cr ete  and  Sparta  p arallel  to  that  of  Egypt,  namely ,  to  arrest  all social change. In  this  context,  a  passage  in  the   T imaeus  (see  especially  24a-b)  seems important.  In  this  passage,  Plato   tries  to  show  (a)  that  a  class  division  very similar  to  that  of  the  Republic  was  established  in  Athens  at  a  v ery  ancient period  o f  its  pre-historical  development,  and  (b)  that  these  institutions  were closely  akin  to  t he  caste  system  of  Egypt  (whose  arrested  caste  institutions he  assum es  to  have  derived  from  his  ancient  Athenian  state).   Thus  Plato himself  acknowl edges  by  implication  that  the  ideal  ancient  and  perfect  state of  t he  Republic  is  a  caste  s tate.  It  is  interesting  that   G  rantor ,  first commentator  on   the  T imaeus,  reports,  only  two  generations  after  Plato,  that Plato  h ad  been  accused  of  d eserting  the  Athenian  tradition,  and  of becoming  a  disciple  of  the  E gyptians.  (Cp.  Gomperz,  Greek  Thinkers, Germ,  ed.,  II,  476.)  See  also  Isocrates*  Busiris,  quoted  in  note  3  to  chapter 13. For  the  problem  of  the  castes  in  the  Republic,  see  furthermore  notes  31 and  32  (i,  d)  to  this  chapter ,  note  40  to  chapter  6,  and  notes  1 1-14  to  chapter 8.  A .  E.  T aylor ,  Plato  :  The  M an  and  His  W ork,  pp.  269  f.,  forcefully denounces the view that Plato favoured a caste state. 28   C  p.  Republic,  4i6a.  The  pro blem  is  considered  more  fully  in  this chapter ,  text  to  note  35.  (For  the  problem  of  caste,  mentioned  in  the  next paragraph, see notes 27 (3) and 31 to this chapter .) 29  Cp.  Republic,  37id/e.  Adam  comments  (op.  cit.,  vol.  I,  97,  note  to 371032)  :  '  Plato   does  not  admit  slave  labour  in  his  city ,  unless   perhaps  in the  pers ons  of  barbarians.'  I  a gree  that  Plato  in  the  Republic  ^Ggb-c) opposed  the  enslavement  of  Gre ek  prisoners  of  war  ;  but  he  enco uraged  that of  barbarians.

the  law  (III,  80,  6)  ;  see  also  note  14  to  this  chapter .  The passage  from  Herodotus,  which   influenced  Plato  in  other  wa ys  also  (cp. note  24  to  chapt er  4),  is  one  which  Plato  ridicules  in  the  Republ ic  just  as  he ridicules Pericles' oration ; rp. note 14 to chapter 4 and 34 to chapter 10. 18  E ven  the  naturalist  Aristotle  does  not  always  refer  to  this  nat uralistic version  of  equalitarianism  ;  for  instance,  his  formulation  of  the  principles  of democracy  in  Politics,  i^ijb  (cp.  note  9  to  this  chapter ,  and  te xt)  is  quite independent  of  it.  But  it  is  perha ps  even  more  interesting  that  in  the  Gor gias in  which  the  opposition  of  nature  and  convention  plays  such  an  important role,  Plato  presents  equalitarian ism  without  burdening  it  with  the  dubious theory  of  the  na tural  equality  of  all  men  (see  4886  /48ga,  quoted  in  note  14 to this chapter , and 483d, 4843, and 5083). 19 Cp. Menexenus, 238e/23ga. The passage immediately follows a clear allusion  to  Pericles'  oration  (viz.,  to  the  second  sentence  quoted  in  the  text to  note  17,  in  this  chapter).—It  seems  not  improbable  that  the  reiteration  of the  term  '  equal  birth  '  in  that  passage  is  meant  as  a  scornful  allu sion  to  the  ' low  *  birth  of  Pericles'  and  Aspasia's  sons,  who  were  rec ognized  as Athenian citizens only  by   special  legislation  in  429  B.C.  (Cp.  E.  Meyer ,  Gesch.  d. Altertums, vol. IV , p. 14, note to No. 392, and p. 323, No. 558.) (It  has  been  held  (even  by  Grote  ;  cp.  his  Plato,  III,  p.  1 1)  that  Plato  in the  M enexenus,  '  in  his  own  rhetorical  discourse,  .  .  drops  the  iro nical  vein  ', i.e.  that  the  middle  part  of  the  Menexenus,  from  which  the  quotation  in  the text  is  taken,  is  not  meant  ironic ally .  But  in  view  of  the  quoted  passage  on equality ,  and  in  view  of  Plato's  open  scorn  in  the  Republic  when  he  deals with  this  point  (cp.  note  14  to  this  chapter),  this  opinion  se ems  to  me untenable.  And  it  appears  to  me  equally  impossible  to  doubt  the  ironical character  of  the  passage  immediately  preceding  the  one  quoted  in  the  text where  Plato  says  of  Athens  (cp.  238c/d)  :  '  In  this  time  as  well  as   at  present  . .  ou r  government  was  always  an  aristocracy  .  .  ;  though  it  is  sometimes called  a  democracy ,  it  is  really  an  aristocracy ,  that  is  to  say ,  a  rule  of  the best,  with  the  approval  of  the   many  .  .'  In  view  of  Plato' s  hatred  of democracy ,  this  description  needs  no  further  comment .—For  the genuineness of the Menexenus, cp. also note 35 to chapter 10. 20 Laws, 757a ; cp. the whole passage 7573-0. (1)  F or  what  I  call  the  standard  objection  against  cqualitarianism,  cp. also  Laws,  744b,  f f.  'It  would  b e  excellent  if  everybody  could  .  .  have  all things  eq ual  ;  but  since  this  is  im possible  .  .',  etc.  The  passage  is  especially interesting  in  view  of  the  fact  th at  Plato  is  often  described  as  an  enemy  of plutocracy by many writers who judge him only by the Republic. But in this important  passag e  of  the  Laws  (i.e.  744b,  f f.)  Plato  demands  that  *  political of fices,  and  contributions,  as  well  as  distributions  of  bounties,  should  be proportional  to  the  value  of  a  ci tizen's  wealth.  And  they  should  depend  not only  on  his  virtue  or  that  of  his  ancestors  or  on  the  size  and  attractiveness  of his  body ,  but  a4so  upon  his  wealth  or  his  poverty .  In  this  way ,   a  man  will receive  honours  and  of fices  as  equitably  as  possible,  i.e.  in  proportion  to  his wealth,  although  according  to  a  principle  of  unequal  distribution.'  The  basic idea  of  this  attitude,  viz.,  that  it  is  unjust  to  treat  unequals  equ ally ,  can  be found,  in   a  passing  remark,  as  e arly  as  the  Protagoras  (337a)  ;  but  Plato  did not make much use of the idea before writing the Laws. (2)  F or  A ristotle's  elaboration  of   these  ideas,  cp.  esp.  his  Politics,  III,  9, i,  i28 oa  (see  also  III,  12-13,  12820-1284^,  where  he  writes  :  *  A ll  men  cling to  justice  of  some  kind,  but  their  conceptions  are  imperfect,  and  do  not embrace  the  whole  Idea.  For  ex ample,  justice  is  thought  (by  de mocrats)  to be  equality  ;  and  so  it  is,  although  it  is  not  equality  for  all,  but  only  for equals.  And  justice  is  thought  ( by  oligarchs)  to  be  inequality  ;  and  so  it  is, although it is not inequality for all, but only for unequals.' (3)  A gainst  all  this  anti-equalit arianism,  I  maintain,  with  Kant,  that  it must  be  the  principle  of  all  morality  that  no  man  should  consider  himself more  valuable  than  any  other

Republic,  485a/b  quoted  in  note  26  (i)  to  chapter  3  and  in  text  to  note  33  to chapter 8. 38  T his  is  the   main  point  in   which  I  must  deviate  from  Adam's interpretation.  I  believe  Plato  to  indicate  that  the  philosopher  kin g  of  Books VI—VII,  whose  main  interest  is  in  the  things  that  are  not  generated  and

and  customs.  .  .  When  the rich  rul e  and  imitate  the  true  Form,  then  the  governmen t  is  called aristocracy  ;  and  when  they  do  not  heed  the  (ancient)  laws,  oligarchy ,'  etc.  It is  impor tant  to  note  that  not  law fulness  or  lawlessness  in  the  a bstract,  but the  p reservation   of  the  ancient  institutions  of  the  original  or  perfect  state  is the  crite rion  of  the  classification .  (This  is  in  contrast  to  Aristotle's  Politics, I2g2a,  where  the  main  distinctio n  is  whether  or  not  '  the  law  is  supreme',  or , for instance, the mob.) 24  The  passage,  Laws,  7096-7 143,  contains  several  allusions  to  the Statesman  ;  for  instance,  710  d -e,  which  introduces,  following  Herodotus III,  80-82,  the  number  of  rulers  as  the  principle  of  classification  ;  the enumerations  of   the  forms  of  government  in  7126  and  d  ;  and  7i3b,  flf.,  i.e. the  myth  of  the  perfect  state  in  the  day  of  Cronos,  '  of  which  the   best  of  our present  states  are  imitations  '.  In   view  of  these  allusions,  I  little  doubt  that Plato  intended  his  theory  of  the  fitness  of  tyranny  for  Utopian  experiments to  be  understoo d  as  a  kind  of  continuation  of  the  story  of  the   Statesman (and  thu s  also  of  the  Republic).  —The  quotations  in  this  paragraph  are  from the  Laws,  7096,  and  7ioc/d  ;  th e  '  remark  from  the  Laws  quoted  above  '  is 797d,  quoted  in  the  text  to  no te  3,  in  this  chapter .  (I  agree  with  E.  B. England's  note  to  this  passage,  in  his  edition  of  The  Laws  of  Plato,  1921, vol.  II,  258,  that  it  is  Plato's  p rinciple  that  '  change  is  detrim ental  to  the power  .. .  of  anything  ',  and  there fore  also  to  the  power  of  evil  ;  but  I  do  not agree  with  him  *   that  change  fro m  bad  ',  viz.,  to  good,  is  too  self-evident  to be  mentioned  as  an  exception  ;  it  is  not  self-evident  from  the  point  of  view of Plato's doctrine of the evil nature of change. See also next note). 26  Cp.  Laws,  676b/c  (cp.  6763,  quoted  in  the  text  to  note  6).  In   spite  of Plato's  doctrine  that'  change  is  detrimental'  (cp.  the  end  of  the  last  note),  E. B.  England  interprets  these  passages  on  change  and  revolution  by  giving them  an   optimistic  or  progressive  meaning.  He  suggests  that  t he  object  of Plato's  search  is  what  '  we  migh t  call  "  the  secret  of  political  vita lity  ".'  (Gp. op.  c it.,  vol.  I,  344.)  And  he  interprets  this  passage  on  the  search  for  the  true cause  of   (detrimental)  change  as  dealing  with  a  search  for  '  th e  cause  and nature  of  the  true  development  of  a  state,  i.e.  of  its  progress  towards perfection  '.  (Italics  his  ;  cp.  vol.  I,  345.)  This  shows  how   much  the tendency  to  idealize  Plato  and  to  represent  him  as  a  progressivist  blinds even  such  an  excellent  critic  a gainst  his  own  finding,  namely ,  that  Plato believed change to be detrimental. quotation  is  from  the  Laws,  6836.  (Adam  in  his  edition  of  the  Republic, vol.  II,  203,  note   to  545dai,  refe rs  to  this  passage  in  the  Laws.)  England,  in his  e dition  of  th e  Laws,  vol.  I,  360  f.,  note  to  68365,  mention s  Republic, 6oga,  but  neither  545d  nor  4650,  and  supposes  that  the  reference  is  '  to  a previous  discuss ion,  or  one  recorded  in  a  lost  dialogue'.  I  do  not  see  why Plato  should  not  be  alluding  to  t he  Republic,  by  using  the  fictio n  that  some of  its  topics  have  been  discussed  by  the  present  interlocutors.  As  Gornford says,  in  Plato's  last  group  of  dialogues  there  is  '  no  motive  to  keep  up  the illusion  that  the  conversations  had  really  taken  place'  ;  and  he  is  also  right when  he   says  that  Plato  *  was  not  the  slave  of  his  own  fict ions  '.  (Cp. Cornford,  Plato' s  Cosmology ,  pp.  5  and  4.)  Plato's  law  of  revolutions  was rediscovered,  without  reference  to  Plato,  by  V .  Pareto  ;  cp.  his  T reatise  on General Sociology , §§ 2054, 2057, 2058. (At the end of § 2055, there is also a  the ory  of  arres ting  history .)  Rousseau  also  rediscovered  the  laws.  (Social Contract, Book III, ch. X.) 27  ( i)  It  may  be  worth  noting  that  the  intentionally  non-h istorical features  of  the  best  state,  especially  the  rule  of  the  philosophers,  are  not mentioned  by  Plato  in  the  summary  at  the  beginning  of  the  T imaeus,  and that  in  Book  VII I  of  the  Republi c  he  assumes  that  the  rulers  of  the  best  state are  not  versed  in  Pythagorean  number -mysticism  ;  cp.  Republic,  546c/d, where  th e  ruler s  arc  said  to  be  ignorant  of  these  matters.  (Cp.  also  the remark,  Rep.,  543d  /544a,  acco rding  to  which  the  best  state

states  '  in  the  sense  of  or ganized  and even centralized political power . I  ma y  mention  that  T oynbee  h as  a  very  dif ferent  theory .  But  before discussing  it,  I  w ish  first  to  make  it  clear  that  from  the  anti-hist oricist  point of  v iew ,  the  question  is  of  no  great  importance.  It  is  perhaps  interesting  in itself  to  conside r  how  *  states  '  originated,  but  it  has  no  bearin g  whatever upon  the  sociology  of  states ,  as  I  understand  it,  i.e.  upon  political technology (see chapters 3, 9, and 25). T oynbee's  theor y  does  not  confine  itself  to  '  states  '  in  the  sense  of or ganized  and  centralized  politi cal  power .  He  discusses,  rather ,  the  '  origin of  civili zations  '.  But  here  begins  the  dif ficulty  ;  for  what  he  calls  * civilizations  '  are,  in  part,  '  states  '  (as  here  described),  in  part  societies  like that  of  the  Eskim os,  which  are  n ot  states  ;  and  if  it  is  questionable  whether  ' states'  o riginate  according  to  one  single  scheme,  then  it  must  be  even  more doubtful when we consider  a  class  of  such  diverse  social  phenomena  as  the  early  Egyptian and  Mesopotam ian  states  and  their  institutions  and  technique   on  the  one side, and the Eskimo way of living on the other . But  we  may  con centrate  on  T oynbee's  description  (A  Study  of  History , vol.  I,  305  f f.)  of  the  origin   of  the  Egyptian  and  Meso potamian  ' civilizations  '.  His  theory  is  that  the  challenge  of  a  dif fi cult  jungle environment  rouses  a  response   from  ingenious  and  enterprising  leaders  ; they  lead  their  followers  into  the  valleys  which  they  begin  to  cultivate,  and found  states.  This  (Hegelian  and   Ber gsonian)  theory  of  the  cre ative  genius as  a  cultural  and  political  leade r  appears  to  me  most  romantic.  If  we  take Egypt,  then  we  must  look,  first  of  all,  for  the  origin  of  the  caste  system. This,  I  believe,  is  most  likely  th e  result  of  conquests,  just  as  in  India  where every  new  wave  of  conquerors  i mposed  a  new  caste  upon  the  old  ones.  But there  are  other  ar guments.  T o ynbee  himself  favours  a  theory  which  is probably  correct,  namely ,  that  animal  breeding  and  especially  animal training  is  a  l ater ,  a  more  a dvanced  and  a  more  dif ficult  stage  of development  tha n  mere  agriculture,  and  that  this  advanced  step   is  taken  by the  n omads  of  the  steppe.  But  in  Egypt  we  find  both  agriculture   and  animal breeding,  and  the  same  holds  for  most  of  the  early  *  states  '  (tho ugh  not  for all  the  American   ones,  I  gather).  This  seems  to  be  a  sign  that  these  states contain  a  nomadic  element;  and  it  seems  only  natural  to  venture  the hypothesis  that  this  element  is  due  to  nomad  invaders  imposing  their  rule,  a caste  rul e,  upon  the  original  agricultural  population.  This  theory  disagrees with  T o ynbee's  contention  (op.  cit.  9  Ill,  ^3  f.)  that  nomad-built  states usually  wither  away  very  quickl y .  But  the  fact  that  many  of  the  early  caste states go in for the breeding of animals has to be explained somehow . The  idea  that  nomads  or  even  hunters  constituted  the  original  upper class  is  corroborated  by  the  age- old  and  still  surviving  upper -class  traditions according  to  which  war ,  hunting ,  and  horses,  are  the  symbols  of  the  leisured classes  ;   a  tradition  which  formed  the  basis  of  Aristotle's  ethics  and  politics, and  is  still  alive,  as  V eblen  (The  Theory  of  the  Leisure  Class)  and  T oynbee himself  have  shown  ;  and  to  these  traditions  we  can  perhaps  add   the  animal breeder's  belief  in  racialism,  an d  especially  in  the  racial  superiority  of  the upper  class.  The  latter  belief  which  is  so  pronounced  in  caste  states  and  in Plato  an d  in  Aristotle  is  held  by  T oynbee  to  be  *  one  of  the  .  .  si ns  of  our  .  . modern  age  '  and  '  something  alien  from  the  Hellenic  genius  '  (op.  cit.,  Ill, 93).  But  although  many  Greeks   may  have  developed  beyond  racialism,  it seems  likely  that  Plato's  and  Aristotle's  theories  are  based  on  old  traditions  ; especially in view of the fact that racial ideas played such a role in Sparta. 44 Cp. Laws, 6943-6983. 45  ( i)  Spengler's  Decline  of  the   W est  is  not  in  my  opinion  to  be  taken seriously .  But  it  is  a  symptom  ;  it  is  the  theory  of  one  who  believes  in  an upper  class  which  is  facing  defe at.  Like  Plato,  Spengler  tries  to   show  that  ' the  world  *  is  to  be  blamed,  wit h  its  general  law  of  decline  and  death.  And like  Plat o,  he  demands  (in  his  sequel,  Prussianism  and  Social ism)  a  new order ,  a  desperat e

philosopher and strongly influenced by Pythagoreanism. The other steps occur  tw ice  in  a  form  almost  completely  parellel  to  Aristotle's  account; first  briefly  in  28a-2gd,  and  l ater ,  with  more  elaboration,  in  486-550. Immediately  aft er  (a),  i.e.  a  Heraclitean  description  (4ga  If.  ;  cp.  Cornford, Plato's   C  osmology ,  178)  of  the  world  in  flux,  the  ar gument  (b)  is  raised (5ic-c)  that  if  we  arc  right  in  distinguishing  between  reason  (or  true knowledge)  and  mere  opinion ,  we  must  admit  the  existence  of  the unchangeable  Forms  ;  these  are  (in  516  f.)  introduced  next  in  accordance with  step  (d).  T he  Heraclitean  flux  then  comes  again  (as  labouring  space), but  this  time  it  is  explained,  as  a   consequence  of  the  act  of  generation.  And as a next step (/) appears, in 53C. (4)  I t  seems  tha t  this  parallelism  between  the  T imaeus  and  A ristotle's report  ha s  not  been  suf ficiently  e mphasized  so  far  ;  at  least,  it  is  not  used  by G.  C.  IJield  in  his  excellent  an d  convincing  analysis  of  Aristotle's  report (Plato  a nd  His  Contemporaries ,  202  f f.).  But  it  would  have  strengthened Field's  a r guments  (ar guments,  however ,  which  hardly  need  str engthening, since  they  are  practically  conclusive)  against  Burnet's  and  T aylor's  views that  the  Theory  of  Ideas  is  Socr atic  (cp.  note  56  to  chapter  10).  For  in  the T imaeus,  Plato  does  not  put  thi s  theory  into  the  mouth  of  Socrates,  a  fact which  ac cording  to  Burnet's  and  T aylor's  principles  should  prove  that  it  was not  S ocrates'  theory .  (They  avoid   this  inference  by  claiming  that   *  T imaeus  ' is  a  Pyth agorean,  and  that  he  de velops  not  Plato's  philosophy  but  his  own. But  Aristotle  knew  Plato  personally  for  twenty  years  and  should  have  been able  to  judge  these  matters  ;  and  he  wrote  his  Metaphysics  at  a  time  when members  of  the  Academy  could  have  contradicted  his  presentation  of Platonism.) (5)  Burnet  writes,  in  Greek  Phi losophy ,  I,  155  (cp.  also  p.  xliv  of  his edition  of  the  Phaedo,  191 1)  :  '  the  theory  of  forms  in  the  sense  in  which  it is  maintained  in  the  Phaedo  and  Republic  is  wholly  absent  from  what  we may  fairly  regard  the  most  dis tinctively  Platonic  of  the  dialogues,  those, namely ,  in  which  Socrates  is  no  longer  the  chief  speaker .  In  that  sense  it  is never  ev en  mentioned  in  any  dialogue  later  than  the  Parmenides   .  .  with  the single  ex ception  of  the  T imaeus  (sic),  where  the  speaker  is  a  Pythagorean.' But  if  it  is  main tained  in  the  T im aeus  in  the  sense  in  which  it  is  maintained in  th e  Republic,  then  it  is  certa inly  so  maintained  in  the  Sophist  253d/e  ; and  in  the  Politicus,  26gc/d  ;  286a  ;  2g7b/c,  and  c/d  ;  301  a  an d  e  ;  3026  ; and  3O3b  ;  and   in  the  Laws,  yi3b,  73gd/e,  g62c,  and,  most  important, g65b/c  ;  see  als o  the  next  note.  (Burnet  believes  in  the  genuineness  of  the Letters,  especial ly  the  Seventh  ;   but  the  theory  of  Ideas  is  main tained  there in 342a ft.; see also note 56 (5, d) to chapter 10.) 27  Cp.  Laws,  8g5d-e.  I  do  not  agree  with  England's  note  (in  his  edition of  the  Laws,  vol .  II,  472)  that'  the  word  "  essence  "  will  not  hel p  us  '.  T rue, if  we  meant  by  '   essence  '  some  important  sensible  part  of  the  sensible  thing (which  might  perhaps  be  purifie d  and  produced  by  some  distilla tion),  then  ' essence  '  would  be  misleading.  B ut  the  word  *  essential'  is  widely  used  in  a way  which  corresponds  very  well  indeed  with  what  we  wish  to  express  here :  something  opposed  to  the  accid ental  or  unimportant  or  changing  empirical aspect  of  the  thi ng,  whether  it  is  conceived  as  dwelling  in  that  t hing,  or  in  a metaphysical world of Ideas. I  am  using  the  t erm  '  essentialism  '  in  opposition  to  *  nominal ism  ',  in order  to  avoid,  and  to  replace,  the  misleading  traditional  term  *  realism  ', wherever  it  is  opposed  (not  to  *  idealism  '  but)  to  '  nominalism   '.  (See  also note 26 f f. to chapter n, and text, and especially note 38.) On  Plato's  application  of  his  essentialist  method,  for  instance,  as mentioned  in  the  text,  to  the  the ory  of  the  soul,  see  Laws,  8gse  f.,  quoted  in note  15  (8)  to  th is  chapter ,  and  chapter  5,  especially  note  23.

doubtful where he should now look out for justice. (Cp. 368b, f f., 432b, f f.) 13  Adam  (under  the  influenc e  of  Plato)  obviously  overlooks  the equalitarian  theory  in  his  note  to  Republic,  33le,  f f.,  where  he,  probably correctly ,  says  that  '  the  view  th at  Justice  consists  in  doing  good  to  friends and  harm   to  enemies,  is  a  faithf ul  reflection  of  prevalent  Greek  morality  '. But  he  is  wrong  when  he  adds  that  this  was  '  an  all  but  universal   view  '  ;  for he  f or gets  his  o wn  evidence  (note  to  561628),  which  shows  t hat  equality before the laws (' isdnomy ') " was the proud claim of democracy '. 14  A   pas sing  ref erence  to  equality  (similar  to  that  in  the  Gor gias ,  483c/d ;  see   also  this  note,  below ,  and  note  47  to  this  chapter)  is  made  i n  Glaucon's speech  in  Republic,  359C  ;  but  the  issue  is  not  taken  up.  (For  this  passage cp. note 50 to this chapter .) In  Plato 's  abusive  attack  upon  democracy  (see  text  to  notes  14-18, chapter  4),  three  scornful  jocular  references  to  equalitarianism  occur .  The first  is  a  remark  to  the  ef fect  tha t  democracy  *  distributes  equality  to  equals and  to  unequajs  alike  '  (558c  ;  cp.  Adam's  note  to  558ci6  ;  see  also  note  21 to  th is  c hapter)  ;  this  is  intended  as  an  ironical  criticism.  (Equal ity  has  been connected  with  democracy  befo re,  viz.  in  the  description  of  the  democratic revolution  ;  cp.  Rep.,  557a,  quoted  in  the  text  to  note  13,  chapter  4.)  The O.S.I.&.—VOL. I H second  c haracterizes  the'  democ ratic  man  '  as  gratifying  all  his  desires' equally ,'  whether  they  may  be  good  or  bad  ;  he  is  therefore  called  an  ' equalitarianist  *   ('  isonomist'),  a   punning  allusion  to  the  idea  of  equal  laws for  all  }  or'  equality  before  the  law  '  ('  Isonomy  '  ;  cp.  note   17  to  this chapter).  This  pun  occurs  in  Republic,  5616.  The  way  for  it  is  well  paved, since  the   word  *  equal'  has  alrea dy  been  used  three  times  (Rep.,   56ib  and  c) to  chara cterize  a n  attitude  of  the  man  to  whom  all  desires  and  whims  are  * equal'.  The  third  of  these  cheap  cracks  is  an  appeal  to  t he  reader's imagination,  typical  even  nowadays  of  this  kind  of  propaganda  :  '  I  nearly for got  to   mentio n  the  great  r6le  played  by  these  famous  "  equal   laws  ",  and by  this  famous  "   liberty  ",  in  the  interrelations  between  men  and   women  .  .' Rep., 563^) Besides  the  evidence  of  the  importance  of  equalitarianism  mentioned here  (and  in  the  text  to  notes  9  to  10  to  this  chapter),  we  must  consider especially  Plato 's  own  testimony  in  (i)  the  Gor gias,  where  he  writes (4886/4893  ;  see  also  notes  47,  48,  and  50  to  the  present  chapter)  :  '  Does not  the  multitud e  (i.e.  here  :  the  majority  of  the  people)  beli eve  .  .  that justice  is  equality  ?  *  (2)  The  Menexenus  (238e-239a  ;  see  not e  19  to  this chapter ,  and  text).  The  passages   in  the  Laws  on  equality  are  la ter  than  the Republic,  and  cannot  be  used  as  testimony  for  Plato's  awareness   of  the  issue when writing the Republic ; but see text to notes 20 and 21 to this chapter . 16  Plato  himself  says,  in  connection  with  the  third  remark  (^6^b  ;  cp. the  last  note)  :  '  Shall  we  utter  whatever  rises  to  our  lips  ?  ;  b y  which  he apparently  wishes  to  indicate  that  he  does  not  see  any  reason  to  suppress  the joke. 18  I  believe  that  Thucydides'  (II,  37  f f.)  version  of  Pericles'  oration  can be  taken   as  practically  authentic.  In  all  likelihood,  he  was  present  when Pericles  spoke  ;  and  in  any  case  he  would  have  reconstructed  it  as  faithfully as  possible.  There  is  much  reason  to  believe  that  in  those  times  it  was  not extraordinary  for  a  man  to  learn  another's  oration  even  by  heart  (cp.  Plato's Phaedrus),  and  a  faithful  recons truction  of  a  speech  of  this  kind  is  indeed not  as  dif ficult  as  one  might  th ink.  Plato  knew  the  oration,  t aking  either Thucydides'  version  or  another   source,  which  must  have  been  extremely similar  t o  it,  as  authentic.  Cp.  also  note  31  and  34/35  to  chapter  10.  (It  may be  m entioned  here  that  early  in  h is  career ,  Pericles  had  made  rat her  dubious concessions  to  the  popular  triba l  instincts  and  to  the  equally  popular  group egoism  o f  the  people  ;  I  have  in  mind  the  legislation  concerning  citizenship in  45 1  B .C.  But  later  he  revised  his  attitude  towards  these  matte rs,  probably under the influence of such men as Protagoras.) 17  Cp.

recognition  thro ughout  Greece,  and  especially  in  Pcriclean  Athens,  is  most improbable. (Gp. (2) of this note.) (2)  In  the  text  I  have  called  Plato's  attitude  towards  music  (cp.  esp. Rep•>  398e,  f f.)  superstitious  a nd  backward  if  compared  with  *  a  more enlightened  contemporary  criticism'.  The  criticism  I  have  in  mind  is  that  of the  a nonymous  writer ,  probably  a  musician  of  the  fifth  (or  the  early  fourth) century ,  the  author  of  what  is  now  known  as  the  thirteenth  piece  of Grenfell-Hunt,  T he  Hibeh  Papyri,  1906,  p.  45  f f.  It  seems  poss ible  that  the writer  is  one  of   *  the  various  musicians  who  criticize  Socrates   '  (i.e.  the  ' Socrates  '  of  Plato's  Republic),  mentioned  by  Aristotle  (in  his  equally reactionary  Politics,  1342  b)  ;  but  the  criticism  of  the  anonymous  writer goes  mu ch  further  than  Aristotle  indicates.  Plato  (and  Aristotle)  believed that  certain  musical  modes,  for  instance,  the  '  slack'  Ionian  and  L ydian modes,  made  people  soft  and   ef feminate,  while  others,  especially  the Dorian  m ode,  made  them  brave.  This  view  is  attacked  by  the  anonymous writer .  '  They  sa y  ',  he  writes,  *  that  some  modes  produce  temperate  and others just men ; others, again, heroes. and  othe rs  cowa rds.'  He  proceeds  to  show  that  this  view  is  sil ly ,  since some  of  the  most  war -like  of  the  Greek  tribes  use  modes  reputed   to  produce cowards,  while  certain  professio nal  (opera)  singers  habitually  sing  in  the  * heroic'  m ode  without  ever  becoming  heroes.  This  criticism  might  have  been directed  against   the  Athenian  musician  Damos,  quoted  by  Plato  as  an authority ,  a  friend  of  Pericles  (who  was  liberal  enough  to  tolerate  a  pro- Spartan  attitude   in  the  field  of  artistic  criticism).  But  it  might  easily  have been directed against Plato himself. (3)  In  view  of  the  fact  that  I  am  attacking  a  '  reactionary'  attitude towards  music,  I  may  perhaps  remark  that  my  attack  is  in  no  way  inspired by  a  personal  sympathy  for  '  progress  '  in  music.  In  fact,  I  happen  to  like  old music  (the  older  the  better)  and  to  dislike  modern  music  intensely (especially  nearl y  everything  written  since  the  day  when  W agner  began  to write  music).  I  am  altogether  against  *  futurism  ',  whether  in  the  field  of  art or  of   mo rals  (cp.  chapter  22).  But  I  am  also  against  imposing  on e's  likes  and dislikes  upon  others,  and  again st  censorship  in  such  matters.  W e  can  love and  hate,  especially  in  art,  witho ut  favouring  legal  measures  for  suppressing what we hate, or for canonizing what we love. 42 Gp. Republic, 5373 ; and 4666-4676. The  characteriz ation  of  modern  totalitarian  education  is  due  to  A. Kolnai, The W ar against the W est (1938), p. 318. 43  P lato's  remarkable  theory  tha t  the  state,  i.e.  centralized  and  or ganized political  power ,   originates  through  a  conquest  (the  subjugation  of  a sedentary  agricultural  population  by  nomads  or  hunters)  was,  as  far  as  I know ,  fi rst  re-discovered  (if  we  discount  some  remarks  by  Machiavelli)  by Hume  in   his  criticism  of  the  hist orical  version  of  the  contract  theory  (cp.  his Political  Discou rses,  1752,  the  chapter  Of  the  Original  Contract)  :  —' Almost  all  the  g overnments  ',  Hume  writes,  *  which  exist  at  present,  or  of which  there  remains  any  record  in  history ,  have  been  founded  o riginally  on usurpation  or  conquest,  or  both  .  .  .'  The  theory  was  next  revived  by  Renan, in  What   is  a  Na tion?  (1882),  and  by  Nietzsche  in  his  Genealog y  of  Morals (1887)  ;  sec  the  third  German  edition  of  1894,  P-  9&  The  latter  writes  of  the origin  o f  the  *  state  '  :  '  Some  horde  of  blonde  beasts,  a  conquering  master race  with  a  war - like  or ganization   .  .  lay  their  terrifying  paws  heavily  upon  a population  whic h  is  perhaps  immensely  superior  in—numbers.  .  .  This  is the  way  in  whi ch  the  "  state  "  originates  upon  earth  ;  I  think  that  the sentimentality  w hich  lets  it  ori ginate  with  a  "  contract  ",  is  dead.'  This theory  appeals  to  Nietzsche  because  he  likes  these  blonde  beasts.  But  it  has been  also  more  recently  prof fered  by  F .  Oppenheimer  (The  State,  transl. Gitterman,  1914,  p.  68)  ;  by  a  Marxist,  K.  Kautsky  (in  his  b ook  on  The Materialist  Interpretation  of  History]  ;  and  by  W .  G.  Macleod  (The  Origin and  Hist ory  of  Politics,  1931).  I  think  it  very  likely  that  some thing  of  the kind  described  by  Plato,  Hume,  and  Nietzsche  has  happened  in  many ,  if  not in  all,  cases.  I  am  speaking  only  about  '

and  customs.  .  .  When  the rich  rul e  and  imitate  the  true  Form,  then  the  governmen t  is  called aristocracy  ;  and  when  they  do  not  heed  the  (ancient)  laws,  oligarchy ,'  etc.  It is  impor tant  to  note  that  not  law fulness  or  lawlessness  in  the  a bstract,  but the  p reservation   of  the  ancient  institutions  of  the  original  or  perfect  state  is the  crite rion  of  the  classification .  (This  is  in  contrast  to  Aristotle's  Politics, I2g2a,  where  the  main  distinctio n  is  whether  or  not  '  the  law  is  supreme',  or , for instance, the mob.) 24  The  passage,  Laws,  7096-7 143,  contains  several  allusions  to  the Statesman  ;  for  instance,  710  d -e,  which  introduces,  following  Herodotus III,  80-82,  the  number  of  rulers  as  the  principle  of  classification  ;  the enumerations  of   the  forms  of  government  in  7126  and  d  ;  and  7i3b,  flf.,  i.e. the  myth  of  the  perfect  state  in  the  day  of  Cronos,  '  of  which  the   best  of  our present  states  are  imitations  '.  In   view  of  these  allusions,  I  little  doubt  that Plato  intended  his  theory  of  the  fitness  of  tyranny  for  Utopian  experiments to  be  understoo d  as  a  kind  of  continuation  of  the  story  of  the   Statesman (and  thu s  also  of  the  Republic).  —The  quotations  in  this  paragraph  are  from the  Laws,  7096,  and  7ioc/d  ;  th e  '  remark  from  the  Laws  quoted  above  '  is 797d,  quoted  in  the  text  to  no te  3,  in  this  chapter .  (I  agree  with  E.  B. England's  note  to  this  passage,  in  his  edition  of  The  Laws  of  Plato,  1921, vol.  II,  258,  that  it  is  Plato's  p rinciple  that  '  change  is  detrim ental  to  the power  .. .  of  anything  ',  and  there fore  also  to  the  power  of  evil  ;  but  I  do  not agree  with  him  *   that  change  fro m  bad  ',  viz.,  to  good,  is  too  self-evident  to be  mentioned  as  an  exception  ;  it  is  not  self-evident  from  the  point  of  view of Plato's doctrine of the evil nature of change. See also next note). 26  Cp.  Laws,  676b/c  (cp.  6763,  quoted  in  the  text  to  note  6).  In   spite  of Plato's  doctrine  that'  change  is  detrimental'  (cp.  the  end  of  the  last  note),  E. B.  England  interprets  these  passages  on  change  and  revolution  by  giving them  an   optimistic  or  progressive  meaning.  He  suggests  that  t he  object  of Plato's  search  is  what  '  we  migh t  call  "  the  secret  of  political  vita lity  ".'  (Gp. op.  c it.,  vol.  I,  344.)  And  he  interprets  this  passage  on  the  search  for  the  true cause  of   (detrimental)  change  as  dealing  with  a  search  for  '  th e  cause  and nature  of  the  true  development  of  a  state,  i.e.  of  its  progress  towards perfection  '.  (Italics  his  ;  cp.  vol.  I,  345.)  This  shows  how   much  the tendency  to  idealize  Plato  and  to  represent  him  as  a  progressivist  blinds even  such  an  excellent  critic  a gainst  his  own  finding,  namely ,  that  Plato believed change to be detrimental. quotation  is  from  the  Laws,  6836.  (Adam  in  his  edition  of  the  Republic, vol.  II,  203,  note   to  545dai,  refe rs  to  this  passage  in  the  Laws.)  England,  in his  e dition  of  th e  Laws,  vol.  I,  360  f.,  note  to  68365,  mention s  Republic, 6oga,  but  neither  545d  nor  4650,  and  supposes  that  the  reference  is  '  to  a previous  discuss ion,  or  one  recorded  in  a  lost  dialogue'.  I  do  not  see  why Plato  should  not  be  alluding  to  t he  Republic,  by  using  the  fictio n  that  some of  its  topics  have  been  discussed  by  the  present  interlocutors.  As  Gornford says,  in  Plato's  last  group  of  dialogues  there  is  '  no  motive  to  keep  up  the illusion  that  the  conversations  had  really  taken  place'  ;  and  he  is  also  right when  he   says  that  Plato  *  was  not  the  slave  of  his  own  fict ions  '.  (Cp. Cornford,  Plato' s  Cosmology ,  pp.  5  and  4.)  Plato's  law  of  revolutions  was rediscovered,  without  reference  to  Plato,  by  V .  Pareto  ;  cp.  his  T reatise  on General Sociology , §§ 2054, 2057, 2058. (At the end of § 2055, there is also a  the ory  of  arres ting  history .)  Rousseau  also  rediscovered  the  laws.  (Social Contract, Book III, ch. X.) 27  ( i)  It  may  be  worth  noting  that  the  intentionally  non-h istorical features  of  the  best  state,  especially  the  rule  of  the  philosophers,  are  not mentioned  by  Plato  in  the  summary  at  the  beginning  of  the  T imaeus,  and that  in  Book  VII I  of  the  Republi c  he  assumes  that  the  rulers  of  the  best  state are  not  versed  in  Pythagorean  number -mysticism  ;  cp.  Republic,  546c/d, where  th e  ruler s  arc  said  to  be  ignorant  of  these  matters.  (Cp.  also  the remark,  Rep.,  543d  /544a,  acco rding  to  which  the  best  state
