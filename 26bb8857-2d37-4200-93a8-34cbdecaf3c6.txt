======================================================== something  significant in the cosmic scheme of things. Thus the study of the  behaviour of champagne corks and other proxies for what people do  is logically equivalent to the study of  everything  significant. It follows  that humans, people and knowledge are not only objectively significant:  they are by far the most significant phenomena in nature – the only  ones whose behaviour cannot be understood without understanding  everything of fundamental importance.  Finally, consider the enormous difference between how an environ- ment will behave spontaneously (that is to say, in the absence of  knowledge) and how it behaves once a tiny sliver of knowledge, of  just the right kind, has reached it. We would normally regard a lunar  colony, even after it has become self-sufficient, as having originated on  Earth. But what, exactly, will have originated on Earth? In the long  run, all its atoms have originated on the moon (or the asteroids). All  the energy that it uses has originated in the sun. Only some proportion  of its  knowledge  came from Earth, and, in the hypothetical case of a  perfectly isolated colony, that would be a rapidly dwindling proportion.  What has happened, physically, is that the  moon  has been changed –  initially only minimally – by matter that came from the Earth. And  what made the difference was not the matter, but the knowledge that  it encoded. In response to that knowledge, the substance of the moon  reorganized itself in a new, increasingly extensive and complex way,  and started to create an indefinitely long stream of ever-improving  explanations. A beginning of infinity. Similarly, in the intergalactic thought experiment, we imagined  ‘priming’ a typical cube, and as a result intergalactic space itself began  to produce a stream of ever-improving explanations. Notice how  different, physically, the transformed cube is from a typical one. A  typical cube has about the same mass as any of the millions of nearby  cubes, and that mass barely changes over many millions of years. The  transformed cube is more massive than its neighbours, and its mass is  increasing continuously as the inhabitants systematically capture  matter and use it to embody knowledge. The mass of a typical cube is  75 The Spark spread thinly throughout its whole volume; most of the mass of the  transformed cube is concentrated at its centre. A typical cube contains  mostly hydrogen; the transformed cube contains every element. A  typical cube is not producing any energy; the transformed cube is  converting mass to energy at a substantial rate. A typical cube is full  of evidence, but most of it is just passing through, and none of it ever  causes any changes. The transformed cube contains even more evidence,  most of it having been created locally, and is detecting it with ever- improving instruments and changing rapidly as a result. A typical cube  is not emitting any energy; the transformed cube may well be broad- casting explanations into space. But perhaps the biggest physical  difference is that, like all knowledge-creating systems, the transformed  cube corrects errors. You would notice this if you tried to modify or  harvest the matter in it: it would resist! It appears, nevertheless, that most environments are not yet creating  any knowledge. We know of none that is, except on or near the Earth,  and what we see happening elsewhere is radically different from what  would happen if knowledge-creation were to become widespread. But  the universe is still young. An environment that is not currently creating  anything may do so in the future. What will be typical in the distant  future could be very different from what is typical now. Like an explosive awaiting a spark, unimaginably numerous environ- ments in the universe are waiting out there, for aeons on end, doing  nothing at all or blindly generating evidence and storing it up or  pouring it out into space. Almost any of them would, if the right  knowledge ever reached it, instantly and irrevocably burst into a  radically different type of physical activity: intense knowledge-creation,  displaying all the various kinds of complexity, universality and reach  that are inherent in the laws of nature, and transforming that environ- ment from what is typical today into what could become typical in the  future. If we want to, we could be that spark. terminology Person  An entity that can create explanatory knowledge. Anthropocentric  Centred on humans, or on persons.

Spaceship Earth   ‘The biosphere is a life-support system for humans.’ Constructor   A device======================================================== the idea of creativity is still rather confused by various mis  - conceptions. Empiricism miscasts science as an automatic, non-creative  process. And art, though acknowledged as ‘creative’, has often been  seen as the antithesis of science, and hence irrational, random, in    - explicable – and hence unjudgeable, and non-objective. But if beauty  is  objective, then a new work of art, like a newly discovered law of  nature or mathematical theorem, adds something irreducibly new to  the world.  We stare at the red traffic light because doing so will allow us to  continue our journey with the least possible delay. An animal can be  359 Why are Flowers Beautiful?  attracted towards another animal in order to mate with it, or to eat it.  Once the predator has taken a bite, it is attracted to take another –  unless the bite tastes bad, in which case it will be repelled. So there we  have a literal matter of taste. And that matter of taste is indeed caused  by the laws of physics in the form of the laws of chemistry and  biochemistry. We can guess that there is no higher-level explanation  of the resulting behaviour than the zoological level, because the be    - haviour is predictable. It is repetitive, and where it is not repetitive it  is random.  Art does not consist of repetition. But in human tastes there can be  genuine novelty. Because we are universal explainers, we are not simply  obeying our genes. For instance, humans often act in ways that are  contrary to any preferences that might plausibly have been built into  our genes. People fast – sometimes for aesthetic reasons. Some abstain  from sex. People act in very diverse ways for religious reasons or for  any number of other reasons, philosophical or scientific, practical or  whimsical. We have an inborn aversion to heights and to falling, yet  people go skydiving – not in spite of this feeling, but because of it. It  is that very feeling of inborn aversion that humans can reinterpret into  a larger picture which to them is attractive – they want more of it; they  want to appreciate it more deeply. To a skydiver, the vista from which  we were born to recoil is beautiful. The whole activity of skydiving is  beautiful, and part of that beauty is in the very sensations that evolved  to deter us from trying it. The conclusion is inescapable: that attraction  is not inborn, just as the contents of a newly discovered law of physics  or mathematical theorem are not inborn.  Could it be purely cultural? We pursue beauty as well as truth, and  in both cases we can be fooled. Perhaps we see a face as beautiful  because it really is, or perhaps it is only because of a combination of  our genes and our culture. A beetle is attracted to another beetle that  you and I may see as hideous. But not if you are an entomologist.  People can  learn  to see many things as beautiful or ugly. But, there  again, people can also learn to see false scientific theories as true, and  true ones as false, yet there is such a thing as objective scientific truth.  So that still does not tell us whether there is such a thing as objective  beauty. 360 the beginning of infinity Now, why is a flower the shape that it is? Because the relevant genes  evolved to make it attractive to insects. Why would they do this?  Because when insects visit a flower they are dusted with pollen, which  they then deposit in other flowers of the same species, and so the    genes in the DNA in that pollen are spread far and wide. This is the  reproductive mechanism that flowering plants evolved and which most  still use today: before there were insects, there were no flowers on  Earth. But the mechanism could work only because insects, at the    same time, evolved genes that attracted them to flowers. Why did    they? Because flowers provide nectar, which is food. Just as there is  co-evolution between the genes to coordinate mating behaviours in  males and females of the same species, so genes for making flowers  and giving them their shapes and colours co-evolved with genes in  insects for recognizing flowers with the best nectar.  During that biological co-evolution, just as in the history of art,  criteria  evolved, and  means of meeting those criteria  co-evolved with  them. That is what gave flowers the knowledge of how to attract insects,  and insects the knowledge of how to recognize those flowers and the  propensity to fly towards them. But what is surprising is that these    same flowers  also attract humans . This is so familiar a fact that it is hard to see how amazing it is. But  think of all the countless hideous animals in nature, and think also that  all of them who find their mates by sight have evolved to find that  appearance attractive. And therefore it is not surprising that we do not.  With predators and prey there is a similar co-evolution, but in a  361 Why are Flowers Beautiful?  competitive sense rather than a cooperative one: each has genes that  evolved to enable it to recognize======================================================== Congress. This  became a hot political issue in regard to slave-owners. Why should  slave-owning states be allocated more political clout in proportion  to how many slaves they had? To reduce this effect, a compromise  was reached whereby a slave counted as three-fifths of a person for  the purpose of apportioning seats in the House. But, even so, three- fifths of an injustice was still considered an injustice by many.* The  same controversy exists today in regard to illegal immigrants, who  also count as part of the population for apportion  ment purposes. So  *This rule is often misinterpreted as illustrating how slaves were regarded as less than  fully human. But that has nothing to do with the issue. Black people were indeed widely  regarded as being inferior to white ones, but this particular measure was designed to  reduce  the power of slave-owning states compared to what it would have been if slaves  had been counted like everyone else. 330 the beginning of infinity states with large numbers of illegal immi  grants receive extra seats in  Congress, while other states cor    respond  ingly lose out. Following the first US census, in 1790, notwithstanding the new  Constitution’s requirement of proportionality, seats in the House of  Representatives were apportioned under a rule that violated quota.  Proposed by the future president Thomas Jefferson, this rule also  favoured states with higher populations, giving them more rep  resen- tatives per capita. So Congress voted to scrap it and substitute a    rule proposed by Jefferson’s arch-rival Alexander Hamilton, which is  guaranteed to give a result that stays within quota as well as having  no obvious bias between states.  That was the change that President Washington vetoed. The reason  he gave was simply that it involved reallocation: he considered all  reallocation schemes unconstitutional, because he interpreted the term  ‘apportioned’ as meaning  divided  by a suitable numerical divisor – and  then rounded, but nothing else. Inevitably, some suspected that his real  reason was that he, like Jefferson, came from the most populous state,  Virginia, which would have lost out under Hamilton’s rule.  Ever since, Congress has continually debated and tinkered with the  rules of apportionment. Jefferson’s rule was eventually dropped in  1841 in favour of one proposed by Senator Daniel Webster, which does  use reallocation. It also violates quota, but very rarely; and it was, like  Hamilton’s rule, deemed to be impartial between states.  A decade later, Webster’s rule was in turn dropped in favour of  Hamilton’s. The latter’s supporters now believed that the principle of  representative government was fully implemented, and perhaps hoped  that this would be the end of the apportionment problem. But they  were to be disappointed. It was soon causing more controversy than  ever, because Hamilton’s rule, despite its impartiality and proportion- ality, began to make allocations that seemed outrageously perverse.  For instance, it was susceptible to what came to be called the  population  paradox : a state whose population has increased since the last census  can  lose  a seat to one whose population has decreased. So, ‘why didn’t they just’ create new seats and assign them to states  that lose out under a population paradox? They did so. But unfortunately  that can bring the allocation outside quota. It can also introduce  another historically important apportionment paradox: the  Alabama  331 Choices paradox . That happens when increasing the total number of  seats  in  the House results in some state losing a seat.  And there were other paradoxes. These were not necessarily  unfair  in the sense of being biased or disproportionate. They are called  ‘paradoxes’ because an apparently reasonable rule makes apparently  unreasonable changes between one apportionment and the next. Such  changes are effectively random, being due to the vagaries of round  ing  errors, not to any bias, and in the long run they cancel out. But  impartiality  in the long run  does not achieve the intended purpose of  representative government. Perfect ‘fairness in the long run’ could be  achieved even without elections, by selecting the legislature randomly  from the electorate as a whole. But, just as a coin tossed randomly  one hundred times is unlikely to produce exactly fifty heads and fifty  tails, so a randomly chosen legislature of 435 would in practice never  be representative on any one occasion: statistically, the typical  deviation from representativeness would be about eight seats. There  would also be large fluctuations in how those seats were distributed  among states. The apportionment paradoxes that I have described  have similar effects.  The number of seats involved is usually small, but that does not  make it unimportant. Politicians worry about this because votes in the  House of Representatives are often very close. Bills quite often pass or  fail by one vote, and======================================================== science strives for  is nicely described by the quotation from Wheeler with which I began  this chapter: ‘Behind it all is surely an idea so simple, so beautiful, that  when we grasp it – in a decade, a century, or a millennium – we will  all say to each other,  how could it have been otherwise?  [ my italics ].’  Now we shall see how this explanation-based conception of science  answers the question that I asked above: how do we know so much  about  unfamiliar  aspects of reality? Put yourself in the place of an ancient astronomer thinking about  the axis-tilt explanation of seasons. For the sake of simplicity, let us  assume that you have also adopted the heliocentric theory. So you  27 The Reach of Explanations might be, say, Aristarchus of Samos, who gave the earliest known  arguments for the heliocentric theory in the third century  bce. Although you know that the Earth is a sphere, you possess no  evidence about any location on Earth south of Ethiopia or north of  the Shetland Islands. You do not know that there is an Atlantic or a  Pacific ocean; to you, the known world consists of Europe, North Africa  and parts of Asia, and the coastal waters nearby. Nevertheless, from  the axis-tilt theory of seasons, you can make predictions about the  weather in the literally unheard-of places beyond your known world.  Some of these predictions are mundane and could be mistaken for  induction: you predict that due east or west, however far you travel,  you will experience seasons at about the same time of year (though the  timings of sunrise and sunset will gradually shift with longitude). But  you will also make some counter-intuitive predictions: if you travel  only a little further north than the Shetlands, you will reach a frozen  region where each day and each night last six months; if you travel  further south than Ethiopia, you will first reach a place where there  are no seasons, and then, still further south, you will reach a place  where there are seasons, but they are perfectly out of phase with those  everywhere in your known world. You have never travelled more than  a few hundred kilometres from your home island in the Mediterranean.  You have never experienced any seasons other than Mediterranean  ones. You have never read, nor heard tell, of seasons that were out of  phase with the ones you have experienced. But you know about them.  What if you’d rather not know? You may not like these predictions.  Your friends and colleagues may ridicule them.  You may try to modify  the explanation  so that it will not make them, without spoiling its  agreement with observations and with other ideas for which you have  no good alternatives. You will fail. That is what a good explanation  will do for you: it makes it harder for you to fool yourself. For instance, it may occur to you to modify your theory as follows:  ‘In the known world, the seasons happen at the times of year predicted  by the axis-tilt theory; everywhere else on Earth, they  also  happen at  those times of year.’ This theory correctly predicts all evidence known  to you. And it is just as testable as your real theory. But now, in order  to deny what the axis-tilt theory predicts in the faraway places, you  have had to deny what it says about reality, everywhere. The modified  28 the beginning of infinity theory is no longer an explanation of seasons, just a (purported) rule  of thumb. So denying that the original explanation describes the true  cause of seasons in the places about which you have no evidence    has forced you to deny that it describes the true cause even on your  home island. Suppose for the sake of argument that you thought of the axis-tilt  theory yourself. It is your conjecture, your own original creation. Yet  because it is a good explanation – hard to vary – it is not yours to  modify. It has an autonomous meaning and an autonomous domain  of applicability. You cannot confine its predictions to a region of your  choosing. Whether you like it or not, it makes predictions about places  both known to you and unknown to you, predictions that you have  thought of and ones that you have not thought of. Tilted planets in  similar orbits in other solar systems must have seasonal heating and  cooling – planets in the most distant galaxies, and planets that we shall  never see because they were destroyed aeons ago, and also planets that  have yet to form. The theory reaches out, as it were, from its finite  origins inside one brain that has been affected only by scraps of patchy  evidence from a small part of one hemisphere of one planet – to infinity.  This  reach  of explanations is another meaning of ‘the beginning  of infinity’. It is the ability of some of them to solve problems beyond  those that they were created to solve. The axis-tilt theory is an example: it was originally proposed to  explain the changes in the sun’s angle of elevation during each year.

Suppose it  is a rational meme. Then criticism, over generations, will cast doubt  on the story’s truth. Since in reality there are no hobgoblins, the meme  might evolve away to extinction. Note that it does not ‘care’ if it goes  extinct. Memes do what they have to do: they have no intentions, even  about themselves. But there are also other paths that it might evolve  down. It might become overtly fictional. Because rational memes must  be seen as beneficial by the holders, those that evoke unpleasant  emotions are at a disadvantage, so it may also evolve away from  evoking terror and towards, for instance, being pleasantly thrilling – or  else (if it settled on a genuine danger) exploring practicalities for the  present and optimism for the future. Now suppose it is an anti-rational meme. Evoking unpleasant  emotions will then be useful in doing the harm that it needs to do –  namely disabling the listener’s ability to be rid of the hobgoblin and  entrenching the compulsion to think and therefore speak of it. The  more accurately the hobgoblin’s attributes exploit genuine, widespread  vulnerabilities of the human mind, the more faithfully the anti-rational  meme will propagate. If the meme is to survive for many generations,  it is essential that its implicit knowledge of these vulnerabilities be  true and deep. But its overt content – the idea of the hobgoblin’s  existence – need contain no truth. On the contrary, the non-existence  of the hobgoblin helps to make the meme a better replicator, be            -  cause the story is then unconstrained by the mundane attributes of    any genuine menace, which are always finite and to some degree  combatable. And that will be all the more so if the story can also  manage to undermine the principle of optimism. Thus, just as rational  memes evolve towards deep truths, anti-rational memes evolve away  from them. As usual, mixing the above two replication strategies does no good.  If a meme contains true and beneficial knowledge for the recipient, but  disables the recipient’s critical faculties in regard to itself, then the  recipient will be less able to correct errors in that knowledge, and so  will reduce the faithfulness of transmission. And if a meme relies on  the recipients’ belief that it is beneficial, but it is not in fact beneficial,  390 the beginning of infinity then that increases the chance that the recipient will reject it or refuse  to enact it. Similarly, a rational meme’s natural home is a dynamic society – more  or less any dynamic society – because there the tradition of criticism  (optimistically directed at problem-solving) will suppress variants of  the meme with even slightly less truth. Moreover, the rapid progress  will subject these variants to continually varying criteria of criticism,  which again only deeply true memes have a chance of surviving. An  anti-rational meme’s natural home is a static society – not any static  society, but preferably the one in which it evolved – for all the converse  reasons. And therefore each type of meme, when present in a society  that is broadly of the  opposite  kind, is less able to cause itself to be  replicated. The Enlightenment Our society in the West became dynamic not through the sudden failure  of a static society, but through generations of static-society-type evo  - lution. Where and when the transition began is not very well defined,  but I suspect that it began with the philosophy of Galileo and perhaps  became irreversible with the discoveries of Newton. In meme terms,  Newton’s laws replicated themselves as rational memes, and their  fidelity was very high – because they were so useful for so many  purposes. This success made it increasingly difficult to ignore the  philosophical implications of the fact that nature had been understood  in unprecedented depth, and of the methods of science and reason by  which this had been achieved. In any case, following Newton, there was no way of missing the fact  that rapid progress was under way. (Some philosophers, notably Jean- Jacques Rousseau, did try – but only by arguing that reason was  harmful, civilization bad and primitive life happy.) There was such an  avalanche of further improvements – scientific, philosophical and  political – that the possibility of resuming stasis was swept away.  Western society would become the beginning of infinity or be destroyed.  Nations beyond the West today are also changing rapidly, sometimes  through the exigencies of warfare with their neighbours, but more  often and even more powerfully by the peaceful transmission of Western  391 The Evolution of Culture memes. Their cultures, too, cannot become static again. They must  either become ‘Western’ in their mode of operation or lose all their  knowledge and thus cease to exist – a dilemma which is======================================================== and Plato increasingly gets the wrong end of the stick. In reality, the  communication of new ideas – even mundane ones like directions –  depends on guesswork on the part of both the recipient and the  communicator, and is inherently fallible. Hence there is no reason to  expect that the young Plato, just because he was intelligent and highly  educated, and by all accounts a near-worshipper of Socrates, made the  fewest mistakes in conveying Socrates’ theories. On the contrary, the  255 A Dream of Socrates default assumption should be that misunderstandings are ubiquitous  and that neither intelligence nor the intention to be accurate is any  guarantee against them. It could easily be that the young Plato mis  - understood everything that Socrates said to him, and that the older  Plato gradually succeeded in understanding it, and is therefore the more  reliable guide. Or it could be that Plato slipped ever further into  misinterpretation, and into positive errors of his own. Evidence, argu- ment and explanation are needed to distinguish between these and  many other possibilities. It is a difficult task for historians. Objective  knowledge, though attainable, is hard to attain. All this holds as much for knowledge written down as for knowledge  spoken in person. So there would still be a ‘Socratic problem’ even if  Socrates had written books. Indeed, there is such a problem in regard  to the prolific Plato, and sometimes even in regard to living philosophers.  What does the philosopher mean by such and such a term or assertion?  What problem is the assertion intended to solve, and how? These are  not themselves philosophical problems. They are problems in the  history of philosophy. Yet nearly all philosophers, especially academic  ones, have devoted a great deal of their attention to them. Courses in  philosophy place great weight on reading original texts, and com  - mentaries on them, in order to understand the theories that were in  the minds of various great philosophers.  This focus on history is odd, and is in marked contrast to all other  academic disciplines (except perhaps history itself). For example, in all  the physics courses that I took at university, both as an undergraduate  and as a graduate student, I cannot recall a single instance where any  original papers or books by the great physicists of old were studied or  were even on the reading list. Only when a course touched upon very  recent discoveries did we ever read the work of their discoverers. So  we learned Einstein’s theory of relativity without ever hearing from  Einstein; we knew Maxwell, Boltzmann, Schrödinger, Heisenberg and  so on only as names. We read their  theories  in textbooks whose authors  were physicists (not historians of physics) who themselves may well  never have read the works of those pioneers. Why? The immediate reason is that the original sources of scientific  theories are almost never good sources. How could they be? All  subsequent expositions are intended to be improvements on them, and  256 the beginning of infinity some succeed, and improvements are cumulative. And there is a deeper  reason. The originators of a fundamental new theory initially share  many of the misconceptions of previous theories. They need to develop  an understanding of how and why those theories are flawed, and how  the new theory explains everything that they explained. But most  people who subsequently learn the new theory have quite different  concerns. Often they just want to take the theory for granted and use  it to make predictions, or to understand some complex phenomenon  in combination with other theories. Or they may want to understand  nuances of it that have nothing to do with why it is superior to the old  theories. Or they may want to improve it. But what they no longer  care about is tracking down and definitively meeting every last objec- tion that would naturally be made by someone thinking in terms of  older, superseded theories. There is rarely any reason for scientists to  address the obsolete problem-situations that motivated the great  scientists of the past.  Historians  of science, in contrast, must do precisely that – and they  encounter much the same difficulties as the historians of philosophy  who address the Socratic problem. Why, then, do scientists not en    - counter these difficulties when learning scientific theories? What is it  that allows such theories to be communicated through chains of  intermediaries with such apparent ease? What has happened to the  ‘difficulty of communication’ that I stressed above?  The first, seemingly paradoxical, half of the answer is that, when  they learn a theory, scientists are not interested in what the theory’s  originator, or anyone else along the chain of communication, believed.  When physicists read a textbook on the theory of relativity, their  immediate objective is to learn the  theory , and not the opinions of  Einstein or of the textbook’s author. If======================================================== socrates: I do? hermes: Of  course. Have you yourself not often been misunderstood,  even by people trying hard to understand you? socrates: Yes. hermes:  Have you, in turn, not often misunderstood what someone  means, even when he is trying to tell you as clearly as he can? socrates:  Indeed I have. Not least during this conversation!  hermes: W ell, this is not an attribute of philosophical ideas only, but  of all ideas. Remember when you all got lost on your way here from  the ship? And why? socrates: It  was because – as we realized with hindsight – we  completely misunderstood the directions given to us by the captain. hermes: So,  when you got the wrong idea of what he meant, despite  having listened attentively to every word he said,  where did that  wrong idea come from ? Not from him, presumably . . . socrates: I  see. It must come from within ourselves. It must be a  guess. Though, until this moment, it had never even remotely occurred  to me that I had been guessing. hermes: So  why would you expect that anything different happens  when you do understand someone correctly? socrates: I  see. When we hear something being said, we  guess  what  it means, without realizing what we are doing. That is beginning to  make sense to me.      Except – guesswork isn’t knowledge!  hermes:  Indeed, most guesses are not new knowledge. Although  guesswork is the  origin  of all knowledge, it is also a source of error,  and therefore what happens to an idea  after  it has been guessed is  crucial. socrates: So –  let me combine that insight with what I know of  240 the beginning of infinity criticism. A guess might come from a dream, or it might just be a  wild speculation or random combination of ideas, or anything. But  then we do not just accept it blindly or because we imagine it is  ‘authorized’, or because we  want  it to be true. Instead we criticize  it and try to discover its flaws. hermes: Yes.  That is what you  should  do, at any rate. socrates:  Then we try to remedy those flaws by altering the idea,  or dropping it in favour of others – and the alterations and other  ideas are themselves guesses. And are themselves criticized. Only  when we fail in these attempts either to reject or to improve an idea  do we provisionally accept it. hermes:  That can work. Unfortunately, people do not always do  what can work. socrates: Thank you, Hermes. It is exciting to learn of this single  process through which all knowledge originates, whether it is our  knowledge of a sea captain’s directions to Delphi, or knowledge of  right and wrong that we have carefully refined for years, or theorems  of arithmetic or geometry – or epistemology revealed to us by a    god – hermes: It  all comes from within, from conjecture and criticism. socrates: W ait! It comes from within,  even if revealed by a god ? hermes:  And is just as fallible as ever. Yes. Your argument covers that  case just like any other. socrates:  Marvellous! But now – what about objects that we just  experience  in the natural world. We reach out and touch an object,  and hence experience it  out there.  Surely that is a different kind of  knowledge, a kind which – fallible or not – really does come from  without, at least in the sense that our own experience is out there,  at the location of the object.* hermes: You  loved the idea that all those other different kinds of  knowledge originate in the same way, and are improved in the same  way. Why is ‘direct’ sensory experience an exception? What if it just  seems  radically different?  *The ancient Greeks were not very clear about where sensory experiences are located.  Even in the case of vision, many in Socrates’ time believed that the eye  emits  some- thing like light, and that the sensation of seeing an object consists of some sort of  interaction between the object and that light. 241 A Dream of Socrates socrates:  But surely you are now asking me to believe in a sort of  all-encompassing conjuring trick, resembling the fanciful notion that  the whole of life is really a dream. For it would mean that the  sensation of touching an object does not happen where we experience  it happening, namely in the hand that touches, but in the mind –  which I believe is located somewhere in the brain. So all my sen  - sations of touch are located inside my skull, where in reality nothing  can touch while I still live. And whenever I think I am seeing a vast,  brilliantly illuminated landscape, all that I am really experiencing    is likewise located entirely inside my skull, where in reality it is  constantly dark! hermes: Is  that so absurd? Where do you think all the sights and  sounds of  this   dream  are located? socrates: I  accept that  they  are indeed in my mind. But that is my  point: most dreams portray things that are simply not there in the  external reality. To portray things that  are  there is surely impossible  without some input that does not come from the mind but from  those things======================================================== that much harder than imitating  only the first instance; the student’s much easier, because to a human  observer each different way of putting the idea would convey additional  knowledge. Alternatively, suppose that the lecturer had consistently  misspoken in a way that altered the meaning, and had then made one  correction at the end. The parrot would copy the wrong version. The  student would not. Even if the lecturer never corrected the error at all,  a human listener might still have a good chance of understanding the  410 the beginning of infinity idea that was in the lecturer’s mind – and, again, without imitating any  behaviour. If someone else reported the lecture but in a way that  contained severe misconceptions, a human listener might  still  be able  to detect what the lecturer meant, by explaining the reporter’s miscon- ceptions as well as the lecturer’s intention – just as a conjuring expert  might be able to detect what really happened during a trick given only  a false account from the audience of what they saw. Rather than imitating behaviour, a human being tries to explain it  – to understand the ideas that caused it – which is a special case of the  general human objective of explaining the world. When we succeed in  explaining someone’s behaviour, and we approve of the underlying  intention, we may subsequently behave ‘like’ that person in the relevant  sense. But if we disapprove, we might behave unlike that person. Since  creating explanations is second nature (or, rather, first nature) to us,  we can easily misconstrue the process of acquiring a meme as ‘imitating  what we see’. Using our explanations, we ‘see’ right through the be    - haviour to the meaning. Parrots copy distinctive sounds; apes copy  purposeful movements of a certain limited class. But humans do not  especially copy any behaviour. They use conjecture, criticism and  experiment to create good explanations of the meaning of things – other  people’s behaviour, their own, and that of the world in general. That  is what creativity does. And if we end up behaving like other people,  it is because we have rediscovered the same idea. That is why the audience at a lecture, when striving to assimilate the  lecturer’s memes, are not tempted to face the rear wall of the lecture  room, or to imitate the lecturer in any one of infinitely many other  ways. They reject such interpretations of what is worth copying about  the lecturer not because they are genetically incapable of conceiving    of them, as other animals are, but because they are bad explanations  of what the lecturer is doing, and bad ideas by the audience’s own  values. Both puzzles have the same solution In this chapter I have presented two puzzles. The first is why human  creativity was evolutionarily advantageous at a time when there was  almost no innovation. The second is how human memes can possibly  411 The Evolution of Creativity be replicated, given that they have content that the recipient never  observes. I think that both those puzzles have the same solution: what replicates  human memes is creativity; and creativity was used, while it was  evolving,  to replicate memes . In other words, it was used to acquire  existing knowledge, not to create new knowledge. But  the mechanism  to do both things is identical , and so in acquiring the ability to do  the former, we automatically became able to do the latter. It was a  momentous example of reach, which made possible everything that is  uniquely human. A person acquiring a meme faces the same logical challenge as a  scientist. Both must discover a hidden explanation. For the former, it  is an idea in the minds of other people; for the latter, a regularity or  law of nature. Neither person has direct access to this explanation. But  both have access to evidence with which explanations can be tested:  the observed behaviour of people who hold the meme, and physical  phenomena conforming to the law.  The puzzle of how one can possibly translate behaviour back into a  theory that contains its meaning is therefore the same puzzle as where  scientific knowledge comes from. And the idea that memes are copied  by imitating their holders’ behaviour is the same mistake as empiricism  or inductivism or Lamarckism. They all depend on there being a way  of automatically translating  problems  (like the problem of planetary  motions, or of how to reach leaves on tall trees or to be invisible to    one’s prey) into their solutions. In other words, they assume that the  environment (in the form of an observed phenomenon, or a tall tree,  say) can ‘instruct’ minds or genomes in how to meet its challenges.  Popper wrote: The inductivist or Lamarckian approach operates with the idea of  instruction from without, or from the environment. But the critical or  Darwinian approach only allows instruction from within – from within  the structure itself . . . I contend that there is no such thing as instruction from without the======================================================== later survival will depend on being able to  cope when prevention and delaying tactics have failed. Obviously we  need to work towards cures. But we can do that only for diseases that  we already know about. So we need the capacity to deal with unfore- seen, unforeseeable failures. For this we need a large and vibrant  research community, interested in explanation and problem-solving.  We need the wealth to fund it, and the technological capacity to  implement what it discovers. This is also true of the problem of climate change, about which there  is currently great controversy. We face the prospect that carbon-dioxide  emissions from technology will cause an increase in the average temp- erature of the atmosphere, with harmful effects such as droughts,  sea-level rises, disruption to agriculture, and the extinctions of some  species. These are forecast to outweigh the beneficial effects, such as  an increase in crop yields, a general boost to plant life, and a reduction  in the number of people dying of hypothermia in winter. Trillions of  dollars, and a great deal of legislation and institutional change, in    - tended to reduce those emissions, currently hang on the outcomes of  simulations of the planet’s climate by the most powerful supercomputers,  and on projections by economists about what those computations  imply about the economy in the next century. In the light of the above  discussion, we should notice several things about the controversy and  about the underlying problem. First, we have been lucky so far. Regardless of how accurate the  prevailing climate models are, it is uncontroversial from the laws of  physics, without any need for supercomputers or sophisticated model- ling, that such emissions  must ,  eventually ,   increase the temperature,  which must, eventually, be harmful. Consider, therefore: what if the  relevant parameters had been just slightly different and the moment  of disaster had been in, say, 1902 – Veblen’s time – when carbon-  dioxide emissions were already orders of magnitude above their  pre-Enlightenment values. Then the disaster would have happened  438 the beginning of infinity before anyone could have predicted it or known what was happening.  Sea levels would have risen, agriculture would have been disrupted,  millions would have begun to die, with worse to come. And the great  issue of the day would have been not how to prevent it but what could  be done about it .  They had no supercomputers then. Because of Babbage’s failures  and the scientific community’s misjudgements – and, perhaps most  importantly, their lack of wealth –  they lacked the vital technology of  automated computing altogether. Mechanical calculators and roomfuls  of clerks would have been insufficient. But, much worse: they had  almost no atmospheric physicists. In fact the total number of physicists  of all kinds was a small fraction of the number who today work on  climate change alone. From society’s point of view, physicists were a  luxury in 1902, like colour televisions were in the 1970s. Yet, to recover  from the disaster, society would have needed more scientific knowledge,  and better technology, and more of it – that is to say, more wealth. For  instance, in 1900, building a sea wall to protect the coast of a low-lying  island would have required resources so enormous that the only islands  that could have afforded it would have been those with either large  concentrations of cheap labour or exceptional wealth, as in the Nether- lands, much of whose population already lived below sea level thanks  to the technology of dyke-building.  This is a challenge that is highly susceptible to automation. But people  were in no position to address it in that way. All relevant machines were  underpowered, unreliable, expensive, and impossible to produce in large  numbers. An enormous effort to construct a Panama canal had just failed  with the loss of thousands of lives and vast amounts of money, due to  inadequate technology and scientific know  ledge. And, to compound  those problems, the world as a whole had very little wealth by today’s  standards. Today, a coastal defence project would be well within the  capabilities of almost any coastal nation – and would add decades to  the time available to find other solutions to rising sea levels. If none are found, what would we do  then ? That is a question of a  wholly different kind, which brings me to my second observation on  the climate-change controversy. It is that, while the supercomputer  simulations make (conditional)  predictions , the economic forecasts  make almost pure  prophecies . For we can expect the future of human  439 Unsustainable responses to climate to depend heavily on how successful people are  at creating new knowledge to address the problems that arise. So  comparing predictions with prophecies is going to lead to that same  old mistake.  Again, suppose that disaster had already been under way in 1902.  Consider======================================================== first is an attribute  of deep ideas, the second an attribute of deep silliness. By confusing  them, one ascribes to the best art and philosophy the qualities of the  worst. Since, in that view, readers, viewers and critics can attribute any  meaning they choose to the second kind of ambiguity, bad philosophy  declares the same to be true of all knowledge: all meanings are equal,  and none of them is objectively true. One then has a choice between  complete nihilism or regarding  all  ‘ambiguity’ as a good thing in those  fields. Horgan chooses the latter option: he classifies art and philosophy  as ‘ironic’ fields, irony being the presence of multiple conflicting mean- ings in a statement.  However, unlike the postmodernists, Horgan thinks that science and  mathematics are the shining exceptions to all that. They alone are  capable of non-ironic knowledge. But there is also, he concludes, such  a thing as  ironic science  – the kind of science that cannot ‘resolve  questions’ because, essentially, it is just philosophy or art. Ironic science  can  continue indefinitely, but that is precisely because it never resolves  anything; it never discovers objective truth. Its only value is in the    eye of the beholder. So the future, according to Horgan, belongs    to ironic knowledge. Objective knowledge has already reached its  ultimate bounds. 449 The Beginning Horgan surveys some of the open questions of fundamental science,  and judges them all either ‘ironic’ or non-fundamental, in support of  his thesis. But that conclusion was made inevitable by his premises  alone. For consider the prospect of  any  future discovery that would  constitute fundamental progress. We cannot know what it is, but bad  philosophy can already split it, on principle, into a new rule of thumb  and a new ‘interpretation’ (or explanation). The new rule of thumb  cannot possibly be fundamental: it will just be another equation.    Only a trained expert could tell the difference between it and the old  equation. The new ‘interpretation’ will by definition be pure philosophy,  and hence must be ‘ironic’. By this method, any potential progress can  be pre-emptively reinterpreted as non-progress.  Horgan rightly points out that his prophecy cannot be proved false  by placing it in the context of previous failed prophecies. The fact that  Michelson was wrong about the achievements of the nineteenth century,  and Lagrange about those of the seventeenth, does not imply that  Horgan was wrong about those of the twentieth. However, it so  happens that our current scientific  knowledge  includes a historically  unusual number of deep, fundamental problems. Never before in the  history of human thought has it been so obvious that our knowledge  is tiny and our ignorance vast. And so, unusually, Horgan’s pessimism  contradicts existing knowledge as well as being a prophetic fallacy.  For example, the problem-situation of fundamental physics today has  a radically different structure from that of 1894. Although physicists  then were aware of some phenomena and theoretical issues which we  now recognize as harbingers of the revolutionary explanations to come,  their importance was unclear at the time. It was hard to distinguish  those harbingers from anomalies that would eventually be cleared up  with existing explanations plus the tweaking of the ‘sixth place of  decimals’ or minor terms in a formula. But today there is no such  excuse for denying that some of our problems are fundamental. Our  best theories are telling us of profound mismatches between themselves  and the reality that they are supposed to explain. One of the most blatant examples of that is that physics currently  has  two  fundamental ‘systems of the world’ – quantum theory and the  general theory of relativity – and they are radically inconsistent. There  are many ways of characterizing this inconsistency – known as the  450 the beginning of infinity problem of quantum gravity – corresponding to the many proposals  for solving it that have been tried without success. One aspect is the  ancient tension between the discrete and the continuous. The resolution  that I described in Chapter 11, in terms of continuous clouds of fungible  instances of a particle with diverse discrete attributes, works only if  the spacetime in which this happens is itself continuous. But if spacetime  is affected by the gravitation of the cloud, then it would acquire discrete  attributes. In cosmology, there has been revolutionary progress even in the few  years since  The End of Science  was written – and also since I wrote  The Fabric of Reality  soon afterwards. At the time, all viable cosmo- logical theories had the expansion of the universe gradually slowing  down, due to gravity, ever since the initial explosion at the Big Bang  and for ever in the future. Cosmologists were trying to determine  whether, despite slowing down, its expansion rate was sufficient to  make the universe expand for ever======================================================== success. A pessimistic civil- ization considers it immoral to behave in ways that have not been tried  many times before, because it is blind to the possibility that the benefits  of doing so might offset the risks. So it is intolerant and conformist.  But Athens took the opposite view. Pericles also contrasted his city’s  openness to foreign visitors with the closed, defensive attitude of rival  cities: again, he expected that Athens would benefit from contact with  new, unforeseeable ideas, even though, as he acknowledged, this policy  gave enemy spies access to the city too. He even seems to have regarded  the lenient treatment of children as a source of military strength: In education, where our rivals from their very cradles by a painful  discipline seek after manliness, in Athens we live exactly as we please,  and yet are just as ready to encounter every legitimate danger. 218 the beginning of infinity A pessimistic civilization prides itself on its children’s conformity to  the proper patterns of behaviour, and bemoans every real or imagined  novelty. Sparta was, in all the above respects, the opposite of Athens. The  epitome of a pessimistic civilization, it was notorious for its citizens’  austere ‘spartan’ lifestyle, for the harshness of its educational system,  and for the total militarization of its society. Every male citizen was a  full-time soldier, owing absolute obedience to his superiors, who were  themselves obliged to follow religious tradition. All other work was  done by slaves: Sparta had reduced an entire neighbouring society,    the Messenians, to the status of helots (a kind of serf or slave). It    had no philosophers, historians, artists, architects, writers – or other  knowledge-creating people of any kind apart from the occasional  talented general. Thus almost the entire effort of the society was  devoted to preserving itself in its existing state – in other words, to  preventing improvement. In 404 bce, twenty-seven years after Pericles’  funeral oration, Sparta decisively defeated Athens in war and imposed  an authoritarian form of government on it. Although, through the  vagaries of international politics, Athens became independent and  democratic again soon afterwards, and continued for several gener- ations to produce art, literature and philosophy, it was never again  host to rapid, open-ended progress. It became unexceptional. Why? I  guess that its optimism was gone. Another short-lived enlightenment happened in the Italian city-state  of Florence in the fourteenth century. This was the time of the early  Renaissance, a cultural movement that revived the literature, art and  science of ancient Greece and Rome after more than a millennium of  intellectual stagnation in Europe. It became an  enlightenment  when  the Florentines began to believe that they could improve upon that  ancient knowledge. This era of dazzling innovation, known as the  Golden Age of Florence, was deliberately fostered by the Medici family,  who were in effect the city’s rulers – especially Lorenzo de’ Medici,  known as ‘the Magnificent’, who was in charge from 1469 to 1492.  Unlike Pericles, the Medici were not devotees of democracy: Florence’s  enlightenment began not in politics but in art, and then philosophy,  science and technology, and in those fields it involved the same openness  to criticism and desire for innovation both in ideas and in action.  219 Optimism Artists, instead of being restricted to traditional themes and styles,  became free to depict what they considered beautiful, and to invent  new styles. Encouraged by the Medici, the wealthy of Florence competed  with each other in the innovativeness of the artists and scholars    whom they sponsored – such as Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo and  Botticelli. Another denizen of Florence at this time was Niccolò  Machiavelli, the first secular political philosopher since antiquity.  The Medici were soon promoting the new philosophy of ‘humanism’,  which valued knowledge above dogma, and virtues such as intellectual  independence, curiosity, good taste and friendship over piety and  humility. They sent agents all over the known world to obtain copies  of ancient books, many of which had not been seen in the West since  the fall of the Western Roman Empire. The Medici library made copies  which it supplied to scholars in Florence and elsewhere. Florence  became a powerhouse of newly revived ideas, new interpretations of  ideas, and brand-new ideas. But that rapid progress lasted for only a generation or so. A  charismatic monk, Girolamo Savonarola, began to preach apocalyptic  sermons against humanism and every other aspect of the Florentine  enlightenment. Urging a return to medieval conformism and self-denial,  he proclaimed prophecies of doom if Florence continued on its path.  Many citizens were persuaded, and in 1494 Savonarola managed    to seize power. He reimposed all the traditional restrictions on art,  literature, thought and======================================================== understand why it is perhaps not quite  311 A Physicist’s History of Bad Philosophy as bizarre and isolated an event as it may appear, one has to consider  the broader context of bad philosophy. Error is the normal state of our knowledge, and is no disgrace. There  is nothing bad about  false  philosophy. Problems are inevitable, but  they can be solved by imaginative, critical thought that seeks good  explanations. That is good philosophy, and good science, both of which  have always existed in some measure. For instance, children have  always learned language by making, criticizing and testing conjectures  about the connection between words and reality. They could not  possibly learn it in any other way, as I shall explain in Chapter 16.  Bad philosophy has always existed too. For instance, children have  always been told, ‘Because I say so.’ Although that is not always  intended as a philosophical position, it is worth analysing it as one,  for in four simple words it contains remarkably many themes of false  and  bad philosophy. First, it is a perfect example of bad explanation:  it could be used to ‘explain’ anything .  Second, one way it achieves that  status is by addressing only the form of the question and not the  substance: it is about who said something, not what they said. That is  the opposite of truth-seeking. Third, it reinterprets a request for  true  explanation  (why should something-or-other be as it is?) as a request  for  justification  (what entitles you to assert that it is so?), which is  the justified-true-belief chimera. Fourth, it confuses the nonexistent  authority for ideas  with  human  authority (power) – a much-travelled  path in bad political philosophy. And, fifth, it claims by this means to  stand outside the jurisdiction of normal criticism.  Bad philosophy before the Enlightenment was typically of the  because-I-say-so variety. When the Enlightenment liberated philosophy  and science, they both began to make progress, and increasingly there  was good philosophy. But, paradoxically,  bad  philosophy became  worse . I have said that empiricism initially played a positive role in the  history of ideas by providing a defence against traditional authorities  and dogma, and by attributing a central role – albeit the wrong one  – to experiment in science. At first, the fact that empiricism is an  impossible account of how science works did almost no harm, because  no one took it literally. Whatever scientists may have  said  about  where their discoveries came from, they eagerly addressed interesting  312 the beginning of infinity problems, conjectured good explanations, tested them, and only lastly  claimed to have induced the explanations from experiment. The bottom  line was that they succeeded: they made progress. Nothing prevented  that harmless (self-)deception, and nothing was inferred from it. Gradually, though, empiricism did begin to be taken literally, and so  began to have increasingly harmful effects. For instance, the doctrine  of  positivism , developed during the nineteenth century, tried to eliminate  from scientific theories everything that had not been ‘derived from  observation’. Now, since nothing is ever derived from obser  vation, what  the positivists tried to eliminate depended entirely on their own whims  and intuitions. Occasionally these were even good. For instance, the  physicist Ernst Mach (father of Ludwig Mach of the Mach–Zehnder  interferometer), who was also a positivist philosopher, influenced  Einstein, spurring him to eliminate untested assumptions from physics  – including Newton’s assumption that time flows at the same rate for  all observers. That happened to be an excellent idea. But Mach’s  positivism also caused him to oppose the resulting theory of relativity,  essentially because it claimed that spacetime really exists even though  it cannot be ‘directly’ observed. Mach also resolutely denied the existence  of atoms, because they were too small to observe. We laugh at this  silliness now – when we have microscopes that can see atoms – but the  role of philosophy should have been to laugh at it  then . Instead, when the physicist Ludwig Boltzmann used atomic theory to  unify thermodynamics and mechanics, he was so vilified by Mach and  other positivists that he was driven to despair, which may have contributed  to his suicide just before the tide turned and most branches of physics  shook off Mach’s influence. From then on there was nothing to dis  - courage atomic physics from thriving. Fortunately also, Einstein soon  rejected positivism and became a forthright defender of realism. That  was why he never accepted the Copenhagen interpretation. I wonder:  if Einstein had continued to take positivism seriously, could he ever have  thought of the general theory of relativity, in which spacetime not only  exists but is a dynamic, unseen entity bucking and twisting under the  influence of massive objects? Or would spacetime theory have======================================================== know doesn’t count as a ‘revelation’.  hermes:  Most Athenians would indeed call those virtues.

I do not mock from on high, as you do. I want only to  goad my fellow mortal into helping me look beyond that which is  easy to see.  hermes:  But what in the world  is  easy to see? What things are the  easiest  to see, Socrates? 226 the beginning of infinity socrates: [ Shrugs. ] Those that are before our eyes. hermes:  And what is before your eyes at this moment? socrates: You  are. hermes:  Are you sure? socrates:  Are you going to start asking me  how I can be sure  of  whatever I say? And then, whatever reason I give, are you going to  ask how I can be sure of  that ?  hermes: No. Do  you think I have come here to play hackneyed  debating tricks? socrates: V ery well: obviously I can’t be  sure  of anything. But I don’t  want to be. I can think of nothing more boring – no offence meant,  wise Apollo – than to attain the state of being perfectly secure in  one’s beliefs, which some people seem to yearn for. I see no use for  it – other than to provide a semblance of an argument when one  doesn’t have a real one. Fortunately that mental state has nothing  to do with what I do yearn for, which is to discover the truth of how  the world is, and why – and, even more, of how it should be. hermes:  Congratulations, Socrates, on your epistemological wisdom.  The knowledge that you seek –  objective knowledge  – is hard to  come by, but attainable. That mental state that you do not seek –  justified belief  – is sought by many people, especially priests and  philosophers. But, in truth, beliefs cannot be justified, except in  relation to other beliefs, and even then only fallibly. So the quest for  their justification can lead only to an infinite regress – each step of  which would itself be subject to error. socrates:  Again, I know this. hermes:  Indeed. And, as you have rightly remarked, it doesn’t count  as a ‘revelation’ if I tell you what you already know. Yet – notice  that that remark is precisely what people who seek justified belief  do not agree with.  socrates:  What?  I’m sorry, but that was too convoluted a comment  for my allegedly wise mind to comprehend. Please explain what I  am to notice about those people who seek ‘justified belief’. hermes:  Merely this. Suppose they just happen to be aware of the  explanation of something. You and I would say that they  know  it.  But to them, no matter how good an explanation it is, and no matter  how true and important and useful it may be, they still do not  227 A Dream of Socrates consider it to be knowledge .  It is only if a god then comes along and  reassures them that it is true (or if they imagine such a god or other  authority) that they count it as knowledge. So, to them it  does  count  as a revelation if the authority tells them what they are already fully  aware of. socrates: I  see that. And I see that they are foolish, because, for all  they know, the ‘authority’ [ gestures at  hermes]  may be toying with  them. Or trying to teach them some important lesson. Or they may  be misunderstanding the authority. Or they may be mistaken in their  belief that it is an authority – hermes: Yes. So  the thing  they  call ‘knowledge’, namely justified belief,  is a chimera. It is  unattainable  to humans except in the form of self- deception; it is  unnecessary  for any good purpose; and it is  undesired   by the wisest among mortals.  socrates: I  know. hermes:  Xenophanes knew it too; but he is no longer among the  mortals – socrates: Is  that what you meant when you told the Oracle that no  one is wiser than I? hermes: [ Ignores the question. ] Hence, also, I wasn’t referring to  justified======================================================== understand why it is perhaps not quite  311 A Physicist’s History of Bad Philosophy as bizarre and isolated an event as it may appear, one has to consider  the broader context of bad philosophy. Error is the normal state of our knowledge, and is no disgrace. There  is nothing bad about  false  philosophy. Problems are inevitable, but  they can be solved by imaginative, critical thought that seeks good  explanations. That is good philosophy, and good science, both of which  have always existed in some measure. For instance, children have  always learned language by making, criticizing and testing conjectures  about the connection between words and reality. They could not  possibly learn it in any other way, as I shall explain in Chapter 16.  Bad philosophy has always existed too. For instance, children have  always been told, ‘Because I say so.’ Although that is not always  intended as a philosophical position, it is worth analysing it as one,  for in four simple words it contains remarkably many themes of false  and  bad philosophy. First, it is a perfect example of bad explanation:  it could be used to ‘explain’ anything .  Second, one way it achieves that  status is by addressing only the form of the question and not the  substance: it is about who said something, not what they said. That is  the opposite of truth-seeking. Third, it reinterprets a request for  true  explanation  (why should something-or-other be as it is?) as a request  for  justification  (what entitles you to assert that it is so?), which is  the justified-true-belief chimera. Fourth, it confuses the nonexistent  authority for ideas  with  human  authority (power) – a much-travelled  path in bad political philosophy. And, fifth, it claims by this means to  stand outside the jurisdiction of normal criticism.  Bad philosophy before the Enlightenment was typically of the  because-I-say-so variety. When the Enlightenment liberated philosophy  and science, they both began to make progress, and increasingly there  was good philosophy. But, paradoxically,  bad  philosophy became  worse . I have said that empiricism initially played a positive role in the  history of ideas by providing a defence against traditional authorities  and dogma, and by attributing a central role – albeit the wrong one  – to experiment in science. At first, the fact that empiricism is an  impossible account of how science works did almost no harm, because  no one took it literally. Whatever scientists may have  said  about  where their discoveries came from, they eagerly addressed interesting  312 the beginning of infinity problems, conjectured good explanations, tested them, and only lastly  claimed to have induced the explanations from experiment. The bottom  line was that they succeeded: they made progress. Nothing prevented  that harmless (self-)deception, and nothing was inferred from it. Gradually, though, empiricism did begin to be taken literally, and so  began to have increasingly harmful effects. For instance, the doctrine  of  positivism , developed during the nineteenth century, tried to eliminate  from scientific theories everything that had not been ‘derived from  observation’. Now, since nothing is ever derived from obser  vation, what  the positivists tried to eliminate depended entirely on their own whims  and intuitions. Occasionally these were even good. For instance, the  physicist Ernst Mach (father of Ludwig Mach of the Mach–Zehnder  interferometer), who was also a positivist philosopher, influenced  Einstein, spurring him to eliminate untested assumptions from physics  – including Newton’s assumption that time flows at the same rate for  all observers. That happened to be an excellent idea. But Mach’s  positivism also caused him to oppose the resulting theory of relativity,  essentially because it claimed that spacetime really exists even though  it cannot be ‘directly’ observed. Mach also resolutely denied the existence  of atoms, because they were too small to observe. We laugh at this  silliness now – when we have microscopes that can see atoms – but the  role of philosophy should have been to laugh at it  then . Instead, when the physicist Ludwig Boltzmann used atomic theory to  unify thermodynamics and mechanics, he was so vilified by Mach and  other positivists that he was driven to despair, which may have contributed  to his suicide just before the tide turned and most branches of physics  shook off Mach’s influence. From then on there was nothing to dis  - courage atomic physics from thriving. Fortunately also, Einstein soon  rejected positivism and became a forthright defender of realism. That  was why he never accepted the Copenhagen interpretation. I wonder:  if Einstein had continued to take positivism seriously, could he ever have  thought of the general theory of relativity, in which spacetime not only  exists but is a dynamic, unseen entity bucking and twisting under the  influence of massive objects? Or would spacetime theory have======================================================== of unseen people, considers our own  thoughts and intentions to be aggregates of unseen (though not un    - seeable) microscopic physical processes in our brains.  So fruitful has this abandonment of anthropocentric theories been,  and so important in the broader history of ideas, that  anti -anthro- pocentrism has increasingly been elevated to the status of a universal  principle, sometimes called the ‘Principle of Mediocrity’:  there is  44 the beginning of infinity nothing significant about humans (in the cosmic scheme of things) . As  the physicist Stephen Hawking put it, humans are ‘just a chemical scum  on the surface of a typical planet that’s in orbit round a typical star  on the outskirts of a typical galaxy’. The proviso ‘in the cosmic scheme  of things’ is necessary because the chemical scum evidently does have  a special significance according to values that it applies to itself, such  as moral values. But the Principle says that all such values are them- selves anthropocentric: they explain only the behaviour of the scum,  which is itself insignificant. It is easy to mistake quirks of one’s own, familiar environment or  perspective (such as the rotation of the night sky) for objective features  of what one is observing, or to mistake rules of thumb (such as the  prediction of daily sunrises) for universal laws. I shall refer to that sort  of error as  parochialism .  Anthropocentric errors are examples of parochialism, but not all  parochialism is anthropocentric. For instance, the prediction that the  seasons are in phase all over the world is a parochial error but not an  anthropocentric one: it does not involve explaining seasons in terms  of people.  Another influential idea about the human condition is sometimes  given the dramatic name  Spaceship Earth . Imagine a ‘generation ship’  – a spaceship on a journey so long that many generations of passengers  live out their lives in transit. This has been proposed as a means    of colonizing other star systems. In the Spaceship Earth idea, that  generation ship is a metaphor for the  biosphere  – the system of all  living things on Earth and the regions they inhabit. Its passengers  represent all humans on Earth. Outside the spaceship, the universe is  implacably hostile, but the interior is a vastly complex life-support  system, capable of providing everything that the passengers need    to thrive. Like the spaceship, the biosphere recycles all waste and,    using its capacious nuclear power plant (the sun), it is completely    self-sufficient. Just as the spaceship’s life-support system is designed to sustain its  passengers, so the biosphere has the ‘appearance of design’: it seems  highly adapted to sustaining us (claims the metaphor) because  we  were  adapted to  it  by evolution. But its capacity is finite: if we overload it,  either by our sheer numbers or by adopting lifestyles too different from  45 The Spark those that we evolved to live (the ones that it is ‘designed’ to support),  it will break down. And, like the passengers on that spaceship, we get  no second chances: if our lifestyle becomes too careless or profligate  and we ruin our life-support system, we have nowhere else to go. The Spaceship Earth metaphor and the Principle of Mediocrity have  both gained wide acceptance among scientifically minded people – to  the extent of becoming truisms. This is despite the fact that, on the  face of it, they argue in somewhat opposite directions: the Principle  of Mediocrity stresses how  typical  the Earth and its chemical scum  are (in the sense of being unremarkable), while Spaceship Earth stresses  how  untypical  they are (in the sense of being uniquely suited to each  other). But when the two ideas are interpreted in broad, philosophical  ways, as they usually are, they can easily converge. Both see themselves  as correcting much the same parochial misconceptions, namely that  our experience of life on Earth is representative of the universe, and  that the Earth is vast, fixed and permanent. They both stress instead  that it is tiny and ephemeral. Both oppose arrogance: the Principle of  Mediocrity opposes the pre-Enlightenment arrogance of believing  ourselves significant in the world; the Spaceship Earth metaphor  opposes the Enlightenment arrogance of aspiring to control the world.  Both have a moral element: we  should not  consider ourselves signifi- cant, they assert; we  should not  expect the world to submit indefinitely  to our depredations.  Thus the two ideas generate a rich conceptual framework that can  inform an entire world view. Yet, as I shall explain, they are both false,  even in the straightforward factual sense. And in the broader sense  they are so misleading that, if you were seeking maxims worth being  carved in stone and recited each morning before breakfast, you could  do a lot worse than to use their  negations . That is to say, the truth is  that People  are  significant in the cosmic scheme of======================================================== the other and to make it run towards  or away from it respectively, while other genes evolve to make their  organism hard to recognize against the relevant background. That is  why tigers are striped.  Occasionally it happens by chance that the parochial criteria of  attractiveness that evolved within a species produce something that  looks beautiful to us: the peacock’s tail is an example. But that is a    rare anomaly: in the overwhelming majority of species, we do not share  any of their criteria for finding something attractive. Yet with flowers  – most flowers – we do. Sometimes a leaf can be beautiful; even a  puddle of water can. But, again, only by rare chance. With flowers it  is reliable.  It is another regularity in nature. What is the explanation? Why are  flowers beautiful? Given the prevailing assumptions in the scientific community – which  are still rather empiricist and reductionist – it may seem plausible that  flowers are not objectively beautiful, and that their attractiveness is  merely a cultural phenomenon. But I think that that fails closer inspec- tion. We find flowers beautiful that we have never seen before, and  which have not been known to our culture before – and quite reliably,  for most humans in most cultures. The same is not true of the  roots   of plants, or the leaves. Why only the flowers? One unusual aspect of the flower–insect co-evolution is that it  involved the creation of a complex code, or language, for signalling  information between  species . It had to be complex because the genes  were facing a difficult communication problem. The code had to be,  on the one hand, easily recognizable by the right insects, and, on the  other, difficult to forge by other species of flower – for if other species  could cause their pollen to be spread by the same insects without having  to manufacture nectar for them, which requires energy, they would  have a selective advantage. So the criterion that was evolving in the  insects had to be discriminating enough to pick the right flowers and  not crude imitations; and the flowers’ design had to be such that no  design that other flower species could easily evolve could be mistaken  for it. Thus both the criterion and the means of meeting it had to be  hard to vary. 362 the beginning of infinity When genes are facing a similar problem  within  a species, notably  in the co-evolution of criteria and characteristics for choosing mates,  they already have a large amount of shared genetic knowledge to draw  on. For instance, even before any such co-evolution begins, the genome  may already contain adaptations for recognizing fellow members of  the species, and for detecting various attributes of them. Moreover, the  attributes that a mate is searching for may initially be objectively useful  ones – such as neck length in a giraffe. One theory of the evolution of  giraffe necks is that it began as an adaptation for feeding, but then  continued through sexual selection. However, there is no such shared  knowledge to build on across the gap between distant species. They  are starting from scratch. And therefore my guess is that the easiest way to signal across such  a gap with hard-to-forge patterns designed to be recognized by hard- to-emulate pattern-matching algorithms is to use  objective  standards  of beauty. So flowers have to create objective beauty, and insects have  to recognize objective beauty. Consequently the only species that are  attracted by flowers are the insect species that co-evolved to do so –  and humans.  If true, this means that Dawkins’ daughter was partly right about  the flowers after all. They  are  there to make the world pretty; or, at  least, prettiness is no accidental side effect but is what they specifically  evolved to have. Not because anything intended the world to be pretty,  but because the best-replicating genes depend on embodying  objective  prettiness  to get themselves replicated. The case of honey, for instance,  is very different. The reason that honey – which is sugar water – is easy  for flowers and bees to make, and why its taste is attractive to humans  and insects alike, is that we  do  all have a shared genetic heritage going  back to our common ancestor and before, which includes biochemical  knowledge about many uses of sugar, and the means to recognize it. Could it be that what humans find attractive in flowers – or in art  – is indeed objective, but it is not objective  beauty ? Perhaps it is  something more mundane – something like a liking for bright colours,  strong contrasts, symmetrical shapes. Humans seem to have an inborn  liking for symmetry. It is thought to be a factor in sexual attractiveness,  and it may also be useful in helping us to classify things and to organize  our environment physically and conceptually. So a side effect of these  363 Why are Flowers Beautiful?  inborn preferences might be a liking for flowers, which happen to be  colourful and symmetrical.======================================================== 354 Horgan’s misconceptions based on   448 and inductivism  5–7 and instrumentalism  15 mistaken idea of theory-free  observation  39 salutary role  13, 311 see also  knowledge end-of-the-world prophet  14, 21–2;

This myth accounts for the same observations as the original,  and it is testable (and in fact refuted) by the same observations. Yet  what it asserts about reality is markedly different from – in many ways  it is the opposite of – the original myth. Every other detail of the story, apart from its bare prediction that  winter happens once a year, is just as easily variable. So, although the  myth was created to explain the seasons, it is only superficially adapted  to that purpose. When its author was wondering what could possibly  make a goddess do something once a year, he did not shout, ‘Eureka!  It must have been a marriage contract enforced by a magic seed.’ He  made that choice – and all his substantive choices as author – for  cultural and artistic reasons, and not because of the attributes of winter  at all. He may also have been trying to explain aspects of human nature  metaphorically – but here I am concerned with the myth only in its  capacity as an explanation  of seasons , and in that respect even its  21 The Reach of Explanations author could not have denied that the role of all the details could be  played equally well by countless other things. The Persephone and Freyr myths assert radically incompatible things  about what is happening in reality to cause seasons. Yet no one, I guess,  has ever adopted either myth as a result of comparing it on its merits  with the other, because there is no way of distinguishing between them.  If we ignore all the parts of both myths whose role could be easily  replaced, we are left with the same core explanation in both cases:  the  gods did it . Although Freyr is a very different god of spring from  Persephone, and his battles very different events from her conjugal  visits, none of those differing attributes has any function in the myths’  respective accounts of why seasons happen. Hence none of them  provides any reason for choosing one explanation over the other. The reason those myths are so easily variable is that their details are  barely connected to the details of the phenomena. Nothing in the  problem of why winter happens is addressed by postulating specifically  a marriage contract or a magic seed, or the gods Persephone, Hades  and Demeter – or Freyr. Whenever a wide range of variant theories can  account equally well for the phenomenon they are trying to explain,  there is no reason to prefer one of them over the others, so advocating  a particular one in preference to the others is irrational.  That freedom to make drastic changes in those mythical explanations  of seasons is the fundamental flaw in them. It is the reason that myth- making in general is not an effective way to understand the world. And  that is so whether the myths are testable or not, for whenever it is easy  to vary an explanation without changing its predictions, one could just  as easily vary it to make different predictions if they were needed. For  example, if the ancient Greeks  had  discovered that the seasons in the  northern and southern hemispheres are out of phase, they would have  had a choice of countless slight variants of the myth that would be  consistent with that observation. One would be that when Demeter is  sad she banishes warmth  from her vicinity , and it has to go elsewhere  – into the southern hemisphere. Similarly, slight variants of the Perse- phone explanation could account just as well for seasons that were  marked by green rainbows, or seasons that happened once a week, or  sporadically, or not at all. Likewise for the superstitious gambler or  the end-of-the-world prophet: when their theory is refuted by experience,  22 the beginning of infinity they do indeed switch to a new one; but, because their underlying  explanations are bad, they can easily accommodate the new experience  without changing the substance of the explanation. Without a good  explanatory theory, they can simply reinterpret the omens, pick a new  date, and make essentially the same prediction. In such cases, testing  one’s theory and abandoning it when it is refuted constitutes no  progress towards understanding the world. If an explanation could  easily explain anything in the given field, then it actually explains  nothing. In general, when theories are easily variable in the sense I have  described, experimental testing is almost useless for correcting their  errors. I call such theories  bad explanations.  Being proved wrong by  experiment, and changing the theories to other bad explanations, does  not get their holders one jot closer to the truth.  Because explanation plays this central role in science, and because  testability is of little use in the case of bad explanations, I myself prefer  to call myths, superstitions and similar theories  un scientific even when  they make testable predictions.

He finds that, although most  people do sometimes make witty remarks that are original, they never  invent what he considers to be a fully fledged joke: a story with a plot  and a punchline that causes listeners to laugh. Whenever they tell such  a joke, they are merely repeating one that they have heard from someone  else. So, where do jokes come from originally? Who creates them? The  fictional answer given in ‘Jokester’ is far-fetched and need not concern  us here. But the premise of the story is not so absurd: it really is plausible  that some jokes were not created by anyone – that they evolved.  People tell each other amusing stories – some fictional, some factual.  They are not jokes, but some become memes: they are interesting  enough for the listeners to retell them to other people, and some of  those people retell them in turn. But they rarely recite them word for  word; nor do they preserve every detail of the content. Hence an often- retold story will come to exist in different versions. Some of those  versions will be retold more often than others – in some cases because  people find them amusing. When that is the main reason for retelling  them, successive versions that remain in circulation will tend to be    ever more amusing. So the conditions are there for evolution: repeated  cycles of imperfect copying of information, alternating with selection.  Eventually the story becomes amusing enough to make people laugh,  and a fully fledged joke has evolved.  373 The Evolution of Culture It is conceivable that a joke could evolve through variations that  were not intended to improve upon the funniness. For example, people  who hear a story can mishear or misunderstand aspects of it, or change  it for pragmatic reasons, and in a small proportion of cases, by sheer  luck, that will produce a funnier version of the story, which will then  propagate better. If a joke has evolved in that way from a non-joke, it  truly has no author. Another possibility is that most of the people who  altered the amusing story on its way to becoming a joke  designed  their  contributions, using creativity to make it funnier intentionally. In such  cases, although the joke was indeed created by variation and selection,  its funniness was the result of human creativity. In that case it would  be misleading to say that ‘no one created it.’ It had many co-authors,  each of whom contributed creative thought to the outcome. But it may  still be that literally no one understands why the joke is as funny as it  is, and hence that no one could create another joke of similar quality  at will. Although we do not know exactly how creativity works, we do  know that it is itself an evolutionary process within individual brains.  For it depends on conjecture (which is variation) and criticism (for the  purpose of selecting ideas). So, somewhere inside brains, blind vari    - ations and selections are adding up to creative thought at a higher level  of emergence. The idea of memes has come in for a great deal of radical, and in  my view mistaken, criticism to the effect that it is vague and pointless,  or else tendentious. For example, when the ancient Greek religion was  suppressed, but the stories of its gods continued to be told, though  now only as fiction, were those stories still the same memes despite  now causing new behaviours? When Newton’s laws were translated  into English from the original Latin, they caused different words to be  spoken and written. Were they the same memes? But in fact such  questions cast no doubt on the existence of memes, nor on the useful- ness of the concept. It is like the controversy about which objects in  the solar system should be called ‘planets’. Is Pluto a ‘real’ planet even  though it is smaller than some of the moons in our solar system? Is  Jupiter really not a planet but an un-ignited star? It is not important.  What is important is what is really there. And memes are really there,  regardless of what we call them or how we classify them. Just as the  374 the beginning of infinity basic theory of genes was developed long before the discovery of DNA,  so today, without knowing  how  ideas are stored in brains, we do know  that some ideas can be passed from one person to another and affect  people’s behaviour. Memes are those ideas.  Another line of criticism is that memes, unlike======================================================== past and would have in  the future.  But what use are explanations if they cannot make predictions and  so cannot be tested through experience, as they can be in science? This  is really the question: how is progress possible in philosophy? As I  discussed in Chapter 5, it is obtained by seeking good explanations.  The misconception that evidence can play no legitimate role in philo- sophy is a relic of empiricism. Objective progress is indeed possible in  politics just as it is in morality generally and in science. Political philosophy traditionally centred on a collection of issues  that Popper called the ‘who should rule?’ question. Who should wield  power? Should it be a monarch or aristocrats, or priests, or a dictator,  or a small group, or ‘the people’, or their delegates? And that leads to  210 the beginning of infinity derivative questions such as ‘How should a king be educated?’ ‘Who  should be enfranchised in a democracy?’ ‘How does one ensure an  informed and responsible electorate?’ Popper pointed out that this class of questions is rooted in the same  misconception as the question ‘How are scientific theories derived from  sensory data?’ which defines empiricism. It is seeking a system that  derives  or justifies the right choice of leader or government, from  existing data – such as inherited entitlements, the opinion of the  majority, the manner in which a person has been educated, and so on.  The same misconception also underlies blind optimism and pessimism:  they both expect progress to be made by applying a simple rule to  existing knowledge, to establish which future possibilities to ignore  and which to rely on. Induction, instrumentalism and even Lamarckism  all make the same mistake: they expect  explanationless progress.  They  expect knowledge to be created by fiat with few errors, and not by a  process of variation and selection that is making a continual stream  of errors and correcting them. The defenders of hereditary monarchy doubted that any method of  selection of a leader by means of rational thought and debate could  improve upon a fixed, mechanical criterion. That was the precautionary  principle in action, and it gave rise to the usual ironies. For instance,  whenever pretenders to a throne claimed to have a better hereditary  entitlement than the incumbent, they were in effect citing the precaution- ary principle as a justification for sudden, violent, unpredictable change  – in other words, for blind optimism. The same was true whenever  monarchs happened to favour radical change themselves. Consider also  the revolutionary utopians, who typically achieve only destruction and  stagnation. Though they are blind optimists, what defines them as  utopians is their pessimism that their supposed utopia, or their violent  proposals for achieving and entrenching it, could ever be improved upon.  Additionally, they are revolutionaries in the first place because they are  pessimistic that many other people can be persuaded of the final truth  that they think they know. Ideas have consequences, and the ‘who should rule?’ approach to  political philosophy is not just a mistake of academic analysis: it has  been part of practically every bad political doctrine in history. If the  political process is seen as an engine for putting the right rulers in  211 Optimism power, then it justifies violence, for until that right system is in place,  no ruler is legitimate; and once it is in place, and its designated rulers  are ruling, opposition to them is opposition to rightness. The problem  then becomes how to thwart anyone who is working against the rulers  or their policies. By the same logic, everyone who thinks that existing  rulers or policies are bad must infer that the ‘who should rule?’ question  has been answered wrongly, and therefore that the power of the rulers  is not legitimate, and that opposing it is legitimate, by force if necessary.  Thus the very question ‘Who should rule?’ begs for violent, authoritarian  answers, and has often received them. It leads those in power into  tyranny, and to the entrenchment of bad rulers and bad policies; it  leads their opponents to violent destructiveness and revolution. Advocates of violence usually have in mind that none of those  things need happen if only everyone agreed on who should rule. But  that means agreeing about what is right, and, given agreement on  that, rulers would then have nothing to do. And, in any case, such  agreement is neither possible nor desirable: people are different, and  have unique ideas; problems are inevitable, and progress consists of  solving them. Popper therefore applies his basic ‘how can we detect and eliminate  errors?’ to political philosophy in the form  how can we rid ourselves  of bad governments without violence?  Just as science seeks explanations  that are experimentally testable, so a rational political system makes  it as easy as possible to detect, and persuade others, that a leader or======================================================== that seems strange, imagine, for  the sake of argument, that a historian were to discover that Einstein  wrote his papers only as a joke, or at gunpoint, and was actually a  lifelong believer in Kepler’s laws. This would be a bizarre and important  discovery about the  history  of physics, and all the textbooks about  that would have to be rewritten. But our knowledge of physics itself  would be unaffected, and physics textbooks would not need any change  at all. The second half of the answer is that the reason why the scientists  257 A Dream of Socrates are trying to learn the theory, and also why they have such disregard  for faithfulness to the original, is that they want to know how the  world is. Crucially, this is the same objective that the originator of the  theory had. If it is a good theory – if it is a superb theory, as the  fundamental theories of physics nowadays are – then it is exceedingly  hard to vary while still remaining a viable explanation. So the learners,  through criticism of their initial guesses and with the help of their  books, teachers and colleagues, seeking a viable explanation, will arrive  at the same theory as the originator.  That  is how the theory manages  to be passed faithfully from generation to generation, despite no one  caring about its faithfulness one way or the other.  Slowly, and with many setbacks, the same is becoming true in  non-scientific fields. The way to converge with each other is to converge  upon the truth. 258 11 The Multiverse The idea of a ‘doppelgänger’ (a ‘double’ of a person) is a frequent theme  of science fiction. For instance, the classic television series  Star Trek   featured several types of doppelgänger story involving malfunctions  of the ‘transporter’, the starship’s teleportation device, normally used  for short-range space travel. Since teleporting something is conceptually  similar to making a copy of it at a different location, one can imagine  various ways in which the process could go wrong and somehow end  up with two instances of each passenger – the original and the copy. Stories vary in how similar the  doppelgänger s are to their originals.  To share literally all their attributes, they would have to be at exactly  the same location as well as looking alike. But what would that mean?  Trying to make atoms coincide leads to some problematic physics – for  instance, two coinciding nuclei are liable to combine to form atoms of  heavier chemical elements. And if two identical human bodies were to  coincide even approximately, they would explode simply because water  at double its normal density exerts a pressure of hundreds of thousands  of atmospheres. In fiction one could imagine different laws of physics  to avoid those problems; but, even then, if the  doppelgänger s continued  to coincide with their originals throughout the story, it would not really  be about  doppelgänger s. Sooner or later they have to be different.  Sometimes they are the good and evil ‘sides’ of the same person;  sometimes they start with identical minds but become increasingly  different through having different experiences.  Sometimes a  doppelgänger  is not  copied  from an original, but exists  from the outset in a ‘parallel universe’. In some stories there is a ‘rift’  between universes through which one can communicate or even travel  to meet one’s  doppelgänger . In others, the universes remain mutually  259 The Multiverse imperceptible, in which case the interest of the story (or, rather, two  stories) is in how events are affected by the differences between them.  For instance, the movie  Sliding Doors  interleaves two variants of a  love story, following the fortunes of two instances of the same couple  in two universes which initially differ only in one small detail. In a  related genre, known as ‘alternative history’, one of the two stories  need not be told explicitly because it is a part of our own history and  is assumed to be known to the audience. For example, the novel  Fatherland,  by Robert Harris, is about a universe in which Germany  won the Second World War; Robert Silverberg’s  Roma Eterna  is about  one in which the Roman Empire did not fall. In another class of stories, the transporter’s malfunction accidentally  exiles the passengers to a ‘phantom zone’ where they are imperceptible  to everyone in the ordinary world, but can see and hear them (and each  other). So they have the distressing experience of yelling and gesticulating  in vain to their shipmates, who are oblivious and walk right through  them.  In some stories it is only  copies  of the travellers that are sent to a  phantom zone, unbeknown to the originals. Such a story may end with  the exiles discovering that they can, after all, have some effect on the  ordinary world. They use that effect to signal their existence, and are  rescued through a reversal of the process that exiled them. Depending  on the fictional science that has been supposed, they then may======================================================== indeed anything at all, other than their meme-mandated behaviours.  It can perpetuate itself only by suppressing its members’ self-expression  387 The Evolution of Culture and breaking their spirits, and its memes are exquisitely adapted to  doing this. Dynamic societies But our society (the West) is not a static society. It is the only known  instance of a long-lived dynamic (rapidly changing) society. It is unique  in history for its ability to mediate long-term, rapid, peaceful change  and improvement, including improvements in the broad consensus  about values and aims, as I described in Chapter 13. This has been  made possible by the emergence of a radically different class of memes  which, though still ‘selfish’, are not necessarily harmful to individuals.  To explain the nature of these new memes, let me pose the question:  what sort of meme can cause itself to be replicated for long periods  in  a rapidly changing environment ? In such an environment, people are  continually being faced with unpredictable problems and opportunities.  Hence their needs and wishes are changing unpredictably too. How  can a meme remain unchanged under such a regime? The memes of a  static society remain unchanged by effectively eliminating all the  individuals’ choices: people choose neither which ideas to acquire nor  which to enact. Those memes also combine to make the society static,  so that people’s circumstances vary as little as possible. But once the  stasis has broken down, and people are choosing, they will choose, in  part, according to their individual circumstances and ideas, in which  case memes will face selection criteria that vary unpredictably from  recipient to recipient as well as over time.  To be transferred to a single person, a meme need seem useful only  to that person. To be transferred to a group of similar people under  unchanging circumstances, it need be only a parochial truth. But what  sort of idea is best suited to getting itself adopted many times in  succession by many people who have diverse, unpredictable objectives?  A  true  idea is a good candidate. But not just any truth will do. It must  seem useful to  all  those people, for it is they who will be choosing  whether to enact it or not. ‘Useful’ in this context does not necessarily  mean functionally useful: it refers to any property that can make people  want to adopt an idea and enact it, such as being interesting, funny,  elegant, easily remembered, morally right and so on. And the best way  388 the beginning of infinity to  seem  useful to diverse people under diverse, unpredictable cir  - cumstances is to  be  useful. Such an idea is, or embodies, a truth in the  broadest sense: factually true if it is an assertion of fact, beautiful if it  is an artistic value or behaviour, objectively right if it is a moral value,  funny if it is a joke, and so on. The ideas with the best chance of surviving through many genera  tions  of change are truths with reach – deep truths. People are fallible; they  often have preferences for false, shallow, useless or morally wrong ideas.  But  which  false ideas they prefer differs from one person to another,  and changes with time. Under changed circumstances, a specious  falsehood or parochial truth can survive only by luck. But a true, deep  idea has an objective reason to be considered useful by people with  diverse purposes over long periods. For instance, Newton’s laws are  useful for building better cathedrals, but also for building better bridges  and designing better artillery. Because of this reach, they get themselves  remembered and enacted by all sorts of people, many of them vehemently  opposed to each other’s objectives, over many generations. This is the  kind of idea that has a chance of becoming a long-lived meme in a  rapidly changing society.  In fact such memes are not merely  capable  of surviving under rapidly  changing criteria of criticism, they positively rely on such criticism for  their faithful replication. Unprotected by any enforcement of the status  quo or suppression of people’s critical faculties, they are criticized,  but  so are their rivals , and the rivals fare worse, and are not enacted. In  the absence of such criticism, true ideas no longer have that advantage  and can deteriorate or be superseded. Rational and anti-rational memes Thus, memes of this new kind, which are created by rational and critical  thought, subsequently also depend on such thought to get themselves  replicated faithfully. So I shall call them  rational memes . Memes of the  older, static-society kind, which survive by disabling their holders’  critical faculties, I shall call  anti-rational memes . Rational and anti- rational memes have sharply differing properties, originating in their  fundamentally different replication strategies. They are about as  different from each other as they both are from genes. 389 The Evolution of Culture If a certain type of hobgoblin has the property======================================================== the reason was, it cannot have been that  the hot region constituted a physical barrier, for it did not.  Those are the parochial considerations. The bigger picture is that the  spread of llamas  can only  have been prevented by people’s ideas and  outlook. Had the Andeans had a Polynesian outlook instead, llamas  might have spread all over the Americas. Had the ancient Polynesians  not had that outlook, they might never have settled Polynesia in the  first place, and biogeographical explanations would now be referring  to the great ocean barrier as the ‘ultimate explanation’ for that. If the  Polynesians had been even better at long-range trading, they might have  managed to transport horses from Asia to their islands and thence to  South America – a feat perhaps no more impressive than Hannibal’s  transporting elephants across the Alps. If the ancient Greek enlighten- ment had continued, Athenians might have been the first to settle the  Pacific islands and  they  would now be the ‘Polynesians’. Or, if the early  Andeans had worked out how to breed giant war llamas and had ridden  out to explore and conquer before anyone else had even thought of  domesticating the horse, South American biogeographers might now  be explaining that their ancestors colonized the world because no other  continent had llamas. Moreover, the Americas had not always lacked large quadrupeds.  When the first humans arrived there, many species of ‘mega-fauna’  were common, including wild horses, mammoths, mastodons and other  members of the elephant family. According to some theories, the  humans hunted them to extinction. What would have happened if one  428 the beginning of infinity of those hunters had had a different idea: to ride the beast before killing  it? Generations later, the knock-on effects of that bold conjecture might  have been tribes of warriors on horses and mammoths pouring back  through Alaska and re-conquering the Old World. Their descendants  would now be attributing this to the geographical distribution of mega- fauna. But the real cause would have been that one idea in the mind  of that one hunter. In early prehistory, populations were tiny, knowledge was parochial,  and history-making ideas were millennia apart. In those days, a meme  spread only when one person observed another enacting it nearby, and  (because of the staticity of cultures) rarely even then. So at that time  human behaviour resembled that of other animals, and much of what  happened was indeed explained by biogeography. But developments  such as abstract language, explanation, wealth above the level of subsist- ence, and long-range trade all had the potential to erode parochialism  and hence to give causal power to ideas. By the time history began to  be recorded, it had long since become the history of ideas far more than  anything else – though unfortunately the ideas were still mainly of the  self-disabling, anti-rational variety. As for subsequent history, it would  take considerable dedication to insist that biogeographical explanations  account for the broad sweep of events. Why, for instance, did the  societies in North America and Western Europe, rather than Asia and  Eastern Europe, win the Cold War? Analysing climate, minerals, flora,  fauna and diseases can teach us nothing about that. The explanation is  that the Soviet system lost because its ideology wasn’t true, and all the  biogeography in the world cannot explain what was false about it. Coincidentally, one of the things that was most false about the Soviet  ideology was the very idea that there is an ultimate explanation of  history in mechanical, non-human terms, as proposed by Marx, Engels  and Diamond. Quite generally, mechanical reinterpretations of human  affairs not only lack explanatory power, they are morally wrong as  well, for in effect they deny the humanity of the participants, casting  them and their ideas merely as side effects of the landscape. Diamond  says that his main reason for writing  Guns, Germs and Steel  was that,  unless people are convinced that the relative success of Europeans    was caused by biogeography, they will for ever be tempted by  racist   explanations. Well, not readers of this book, I trust! Presumably  429 Unsustainable Diamond can look at ancient Athens, the Renaissance, the Enlighten-  ment – all of them the quintessence of causation through the power    of abstract ideas – and see no way of attributing those events to ideas  and to people; he just takes it for granted that the only alternative to  one reductionist, dehumanizing reinterpretation of events is another.  In reality, the difference between Sparta and Athens, or between  Savonarola and Lorenzo de’ Medici, had nothing to do with their  genes; nor did the difference between the Easter Islanders and the  imperial British. They were all people – universal explainers and  constructors. But their  ideas  were different. Nor did landscape cause  the Enlightenment. It would======================================================== infinity. Specifically, any civilization that is colonizing the universe  in an unbounded way will eventually reach our location.  Hence a single infinite space could play the role of the infinitely many  universes postulated by anthropic explanations of the fine-tuning  coincidences. In some ways it could play that role better: if the prob- ability that such a civilization could form is not zero, there must be  infinitely many such civilizations in space, and they will eventually  encounter each other. If they could estimate that probability from  theory, they could test the anthropic explanation.  Furthermore, anthropic arguments could not only dispense with all  those parallel universes,* they could dispense with the variant laws of  physics too. Recall from Chapter 6 that all the mathematical functions  that occur in physics belong to a relatively narrow class, the  analytic  functions . They have a remarkable property: if an analytic function is  non-zero at even one point, then over its entire range it can pass through  zero only at isolated points. So this must be true of ‘the probability that  an astrophysicist exists’ expressed as a function of the constants of  physics. We know little about this function, but we do know that it is  non-zero for at least one set of values of the constants, namely ours.  Hence we also know that it is non-zero for almost any values. It is  *Let me remind the reader that these highly speculative parallel universes have nothing  to do with the universes or histories in the quantum multiverse, for whose existence  there is overwhelming evidence. Strictly speaking, the standard anthropic ex        planations  postulate infinitely many quantum  multiverses . 453 The Beginning presumably unimaginably tiny for almost all sets of values – but, never- theless, non-zero. And hence, almost whatever the constants were, there  would be infinitely many astrophysicists in our single universe. Unfortunately, at this point the anthropic explanation of fine-tuning  has cancelled itself out: astrophysicists exist whether there is fine-tuning  or not. So, in the new cosmology even more than in the old one, the  anthropic argument does not explain the fine-tuning. Nor, therefore,  can it solve the Fermi problem, ‘Where are they?’ It may turn out to be  a necessary part of the explanation, but it can never explain anything  by itself. Also, as I explained in Chapter 8, any theory involving an  anthropic argument must provide a measure for defining probabilities  in an infinite set of things. It is unknown how to do that in the spatially  infinite universe that cosmologists currently believe we live in. That issue has a wider scope. For example, there is the so-called  ‘quantum suicide argument’ in regard to the multiverse. Suppose you  want to win the lottery. You buy a ticket and set up a machine that  will automatically kill you in your sleep if you lose. Then, in all the  histories in which you do wake up, you are a winner. If you do not  have loved ones to mourn you, or other reasons to prefer that most  histories not be affected by your premature death, you have arranged  to get something for nothing with what proponents of this argument  call ‘subjective certainty’. However, that way of applying probabilities  does not follow directly from quantum theory, as the usual one does.  It requires an additional assumption, namely that when making de    - cisions one should ignore the histories in which the decision-maker is  absent. This is closely related to anthropic arguments. Again, the theory  of probability for such cases is not well understood, but my guess is  that the assumption is false. A related assumption occurs in the so-called  simulation argument ,  whose most cogent proponent is the philosopher Nick Bostrom. Its  premise is that in the distant future the whole universe as we know it  is going to be simulated in computers (perhaps for scientific or historical  research) many times – perhaps infinitely many times. Therefore virtu- ally all instances of us are in those simulations and not the original  world. And therefore we are almost certainly living in a simulation.  So the argument goes. But is it really valid to equate ‘most instances’  with ‘near certainty’ like that? 454 the beginning of infinity For an inkling of why it might not be, consider a thought experiment.  Imagine that physicists discover that space is actually many-layered  like puff pastry; the number of layers varies from place to place; the  layers split in some places, and their contents split with them. Every  layer has identical contents, though. Hence, although we do not feel  it, instances of us split and merge as we move around. Suppose that in  London space has a million layers, while in Oxford it has only one. I  travel frequently between the two cities, and one day I wake up having  forgotten which one I am in. It is dark. Should I bet that I am much  more likely to be in London, just because a======================================================== rats, not tree-felling) until it was destroyed  by epidemics, caused by contact with Europeans. However, I do not  want to discuss whether the prevailing theory is accurate, but only to  use it as an example of a common fallacy – an argument by analogy  about issues far less parochial. Easter Island is 2,000 kilometres from the nearest habitation, namely  Pitcairn Island (where the  Bounty’ s crew took refuge after their famous  419 Unsustainable mutiny). Both islands are far from anywhere, even by today’s standards.  Nevertheless, in 1972 Jacob Bronowski made his way to Easter Island  to film part of his magnificent television series  The Ascent of Man . He  and his film crew travelled by ship all the way from California, a round  trip of some 14,000 kilometres. He was in poor health, and the crew  had literally to carry him to the location for filming. But he persevered  because those distinctive statues were the perfect setting for him to  deliver the central message of his series – which is also a theme of this  book – that our civilization is unique in history for its capacity to make  progress. He wanted to celebrate its values and achievements, and to  attribute the latter to the former, and to contrast our civilization with  the alternative as epitomized by ancient Easter Island. The Ascent of Man  had been commissioned by the naturalist David  Attenborough, then controller of the British television channel BBC2.  A quarter of a century later Attenborough – who had by then become  the doyen of natural-history film-making – led another film crew to  Easter Island, to film another television series,  The State of the Planet .  He too chose those grim-faced statues as a backdrop, for his closing  scene. Alas, his message was almost exactly the opposite of Bronowski’s.  The philosophical difference between these two great broadcasters  – so alike in their infectious sense of wonder, their clarity of exposition,  and their humanity – was immediately evident in their different atti- tudes towards those statues. Attenborough called them ‘astonishing  stone sculptures . . . vivid evidence of the technological and artistic  skills of the people who once lived here’. Now, I wonder whether  Attenborough was really all that impressed by the islanders’ skills,  which had been exceeded millennia earlier in other Stone Age societies.  I expect he was being polite, for it is de rigueur in our culture to heap  praise upon any achievement of a primitive society. But Bronowski  refused to conform to that convention. He remarked, ‘People often ask  about Easter Island, How did men come here? They came here by  accident: that is not in question. The question is, Why could they not  get off?’ And why, he might have added, did others not follow to trade  with them (there was a great deal of trade among Polynesians other  than Easter Islanders), or to rob them, or to learn from them? Because  they did not know how.  As for the statues being ‘vivid evidence of . . . artistic skills’, Bronowski  420 the beginning of infinity was having none of that either. To him they were vivid evidence of  failure, not success: The critical question about these statues is,  Why were they all made  alike ? You see them  sitting there, like Diogenes in their barrels,  looking at the sky with empty eye-sockets, and  watching the sun and the stars go overhead  without ever trying to understand them. When  the Dutch discovered this island on Easter  Sunday in 1722, they said that it had the  makings of an earthly paradise. But it did not.  An earthly paradise is not made by this empty  repetition . . . These frozen faces, these frozen  frames in a film that is running down, mark a  civilization which failed to take the first step  on the ascent of rational knowledge. The Ascent of Man  (1973)  The statues were all made alike because Easter Island was a static  society. It never took that first step in the ascent of man – the beginning  of infinity.  Of the hundreds of statues on the island, built over the course of  several centuries, fewer than half are at their intended destinations.  The rest, including the largest, are in various stages of completion,  with as many as 10 per cent already in transit on specially built roads.  Again there are conflicting explanations, but, according to the prevailing  theory, it is because there was a large increase in the rate of statue- building just before it stopped for ever. In other words, as disaster  loomed, the islanders diverted ever more effort not into addressing the  problem – for they did not know how to do that – but into making  ever more and bigger (but very rarely better) monuments to their  ancestors. And what were those roads made of? Trees.  When Bronowski made his documentary, there were as yet no  detailed theories of how the Easter Island civilization fell. But, unlike  Attenborough, he was not interested in that, because his whole purpose  in going to Easter Island was to point out======================================================== namely that they are universal explainers, which makes them  universal constructors as well. The effects of that universality are,    as I have explained, explicable only by means of the full gamut of  fundamental explanations. It is also the only kind of universality  capable of transcending its parochial origins: universal computers  cannot really be universal unless there are people present to provide  energy and maintenance – indefinitely. And the same is true of all those  other technologies. Even life on Earth will eventually be extinguished,  unless people decide otherwise.

Because error-correction is essential in processes  of potentially unlimited length, the jump to universality only ever  happens in digital systems. 148 7 Artificial Creativity Alan Turing founded the theory of classical computation in 1936 and  helped to construct one of the first universal classical computers during  the Second World War. He is rightly known as the father of modern  computing. Babbage deserves to be called its grandfather, but, unlike  Babbage and Lovelace, Turing did understand that artificial intelligence  (AI) must in principle be possible because a universal computer is a  universal simulator. In 1950, in a paper entitled ‘Computing Machinery  and Intelligence’, he famously addressed the question:  can a machine  think?  Not only did he defend the proposition that it can, on the grounds  of universality, he also proposed a test for whether a program had  achieved it. Now known as the Turing test, it is simply that a suitable  (human) judge be unable to tell whether the program is human or not.  In that paper and subsequently, Turing sketched protocols for carrying  out his test. For instance, he suggested that both the program and a  genuine human should separately interact with the judge via some  purely textual medium such as a teleprinter, so that only the thinking  abilities of the candidates would be tested, not their appearance. Turing’s test, and his arguments, set many researchers thinking, not  only about whether he was right, but also about how to pass the test.  Programs began to be written with the intention of investigating what  might be involved in passing it.  In 1964 the computer scientist Joseph Weizenbaum wrote a program  called  Eliza , designed to imitate a psychotherapist. He deemed psycho- therapists to be an especially easy type of human to imitate because  the program could then give opaque answers about itself, and only  ask questions based on the user’s own questions and statements. It was  a remarkably simple program. Nowadays such programs are popular  149 Artificial Creativity projects for students of programming, because they are fun and easy  to write. A typical one has two basic strategies. First it    scans the input for certain keywords and grammatical forms. If this is  successful, it replies based on a template, filling in the blanks using  words in the input. For instance, given the input  I hate my job ,  the program might recognize the grammar of the sentence, involving  a possessive pronoun ‘my’, and might also recognize ‘hate’ as a keyword  from a built-in list such as ‘love/hate/like/dislike/want’, in which case  it could choose a suitable template and reply:  What do you hate  most about your job?  If it cannot parse the input to that extent,  it asks a question of its own, choosing randomly from a stock pattern  which may or may not depend on the input sentence. For instance, if  asked  How does a television work? , it might reply,  What is  so interesting about “How does a television work?”?   Or it might just ask,  Why does that interest you?  Another  strategy, used by recent internet-based versions of  Eliza , is to build up  a database of previous conversations, enabling the program simply to  repeat phrases that other users have typed in, again choosing them  according to keywords======================================================== the  kind of dictatorship that has secret police who come for you in the  middle of the night if you criticize them. Virtually all commentators have responded to these paradoxes and  no-go theorems in a mistaken and rather revealing way: they  regret   them. This illustrates the confusion to which I am referring.  They wish  that these theorems of pure mathematics were false.  If only mathem- atics permitted it, they complain, we human beings could set up a    just society that makes its decisions rationally. But, faced with the  impossibility of that, there is nothing left for us to do but to decide  which injustices and irrationalities we like best, and to enshrine them  in law. As Webster wrote, of the apportionment problem, ‘That which  cannot be done perfectly must be done in a manner as near perfection  as can be. If exactness cannot, from the nature of things, be attained,  344 the beginning of infinity then the nearest practicable approach to exactness ought to be made.’ But what sort of ‘perfection’ is a  logical contradiction ? A logical  contradiction is nonsense. The truth is simpler: if your conception of  justice conflicts with the demands of logic or rationality then it is unjust.  If your conception of rationality conflicts with a mathematical theorem  (or, in this case, with many theorems) then your conception of ration- ality is irrational. To stick stubbornly to logically impossible values  not only guarantees failure in the narrow sense that one can never meet  them, it also forces one to reject optimism (‘every evil is due to lack of  knowledge’), and so deprives one of the means to make progress.  Wishing for something that is logically impossible is a sign that there  is something better to wish for. Moreover, if my conjecture in Chapter  8 is true, an impossible wish is ultimately  uninteresting  as well. We need something better to wish for. Something that is not in    - compatible with logic, reason or progress. We have already encountered  it. It is the basic condition for a political system to be capable of making  sustained progress: Popper’s criterion that the system facilitate the  removal of bad policies and bad governments without violence. That  entails abandoning ‘who should rule?’ as a criterion for judging political  systems. The entire controversy about apportionment rules and all  other issues in social-choice theory has traditionally been framed by  all concerned in terms of ‘who should rule?’: what is the right number  of seats for each state, or for each political party? What does the group  – presumed entitled to rule over its subgroups and individuals – ‘want’,  and what institutions will get it what it ‘wants’? So let us reconsider collective decision-making in terms of Popper’s  criterion instead. Instead of wondering earnestly which of the self- evident yet mutually inconsistent criteria of fairness, representativeness  and so on are the most self-evident, so that they can be entrenched, we  judge such criteria, along with all other actual or proposed political  institutions, according to how well they promote the removal of bad  rulers and bad policies. To do this, they must embody traditions    of peaceful, critical discussion – of rulers, policies and the political  institutions themselves. In this view, any interpretation of the democratic process as merely  a way of consulting the people to find out who should rule or what  policies to implement misses the point of what is happening. An election  345 Choices does not play the same role in a rational society as consulting an oracle  or a priest, or obeying orders from the king, did in earlier societies. The  essence of democratic decision-making is not the choice made by the  system at elections, but the ideas created between elections. And elections  are merely one of the many institutions whose function is to allow such  ideas to be created, tested, modified and rejected. The voters are not a  fount of wisdom from which the right policies can be empirically  ‘derived’. They are attempting, fallibly, to explain the world and thereby  to improve it. They are, both individually and collectively, seeking the  truth – or should be, if they are rational. And there  is  an objective truth  of the matter. Problems are soluble. Society is not a zero-sum game: the  civilization of the Enlightenment did not get where it is today by cleverly  sharing out the wealth, votes or anything else that was in dispute when  it began. It got here by creating  ex nihilo . In particular, what voters are  doing in elections is not synthesizing a decision of a superhuman being,  ‘Society’. They are choosing which experiments are to be attempted  next, and (principally) which are to be abandoned because there is no  longer a good explanation for why they are best. The politicians, and  their policies, are those experiments.  When one uses no-go theorems such as Arrow’s to model real  decision-making, one has to assume – quite======================================================== explanations, not justifications, and one does this  creatively, using conjecture, tempered by every kind of criticism. It is in  the nature of good explanations – being hard to vary – that there is  only one of them. Having created it, one is no longer tempted by the  alternatives. They have been not outweighed, but out-argued, refuted  and abandoned. During the course of a creative process, one is not  struggling to distinguish between countless different explanations of  nearly equal merit; typically, one is struggling to create even one good  explanation, and, having succeeded, one is glad to be rid of the rest. Another misconception to which the idea of decision-making by  weighing sometimes leads is that problems can be solved by weighing  – in particular, that disputes between advocates of rival explanations  342 the beginning of infinity can be resolved by creating a weighted average of their proposals. But  the fact is that a good explanation, being hard to vary at all without  losing its explanatory power, is hard to mix with a rival explanation:  something halfway between them is usually worse than either of them  separately. Mixing two explanations to create a  better  explanation  requires an additional act of creativity. That is why good explanations  are discrete – separated from each other by bad explanations –    and why, when choosing between explanations, we are faced with  discrete options. In complex decisions, the creative phase is often followed by a  mechanical, perspiration phase in which one ties down details of the  explanation that are not yet hard to vary but can be made so by  non-creative means. For example, an architect whose client asks how  tall a skyscraper can be built, given certain constraints, does not just  calculate that number from a formula. The decision-making process  may  end  with such a calculation, but it begins creatively, with ideas  for how the client’s priorities and constraints might best be met by a  new design. And, before that, the clients had to decide – creatively –  what those priorities and constraints should be. At the beginning of  that process they would not have been aware of all the preferences that  they would end up presenting to architects. Similarly, a voter may look  through lists of the various parties’ policies, and may even assign each  issue a ‘weight’ to represent its importance; but one can do that only  after  one has thought about one’s political philosophy, and has ex    - plained to one’s own satisfaction how important that makes the various  issues, what policies the various parties are likely to adopt in regard  to those issues, and so on. The type of ‘decision’ considered in social-choice theory is choosing  from options that are known and fixed, according to preferences that  are known, fixed and consistent. The quintessential example is a voter’s  choice, in the polling booth, not of which candidate to prefer but of  which box to check. As I have explained, this is a grossly inadequate,  and inaccurate, model of human decision-making. In reality, the voter  is choosing between explanations, not checkboxes, and, while very few  voters choose to affect the checkboxes themselves, by running for office,  all rational voters create their own explanation for which checkbox  they personally should choose. 343 Choices So it is not true that decision-making necessarily suffers from those  crude irrationalities – not because there is anything wrong with Arrow’s  theorem or any of the other no-go theorems, but because social-choice  theory is itself based on false assumptions about what thinking and  deciding consist of. It is Zeno’s mistake. It is mistaking an abstract  process that it has  named  decision-making for the real-life process of  the same name.  Similarly, what is called a ‘dictator’ in Arrow’s theorem is not neces- sarily a dictator in the ordinary sense of the word. It is simply any  agent to whom the society’s decision-making rules assign the sole right  to make a particular decision regardless of the preferences of anyone  else. Thus, every law that requires an individual’s consent for some-  thing – such as the law against rape, or against involuntary surgery  – establishes a ‘dictatorship’ in the technical sense used in Arrow’s  theorem. Everyone is a dictator over their own body. The law against  theft establishes a dictatorship over one’s own possessions. A free  election is, by definition, one in which every voter is a dictator over  their own ballot paper. Arrow’s theorem itself assumes that all the  participants are in sole control of their  contributions  to the decision- making process. More generally, the most important conditions for  rational decision-making – such as freedom of thought and of speech,  tolerance of dissent, and the self-determination of individuals – all  require ‘dictatorships’ in Arrow’s mathematical sense. It is under- standable that he chose that term. But it has nothing to do with======================================================== distinction between finite and infinite that is relevant to that  physical situation. That is simply false. If he is complaining that the  mathematical notion of infinity does not make sense, then we can refer  him to Cantor, who showed that it does. If he is complaining that the  physical event of Achilles overtaking the tortoise does not make sense,  then he is claiming that the laws of physics are inconsistent – but they  are not. But if he is complaining that there is something inconsistent  about motion because one could not  experience  each point along a  continuous path, then he is simply confusing two different things that  both happen to be called ‘infinity’. There is nothing more to all his  paradoxes than that mistake. What Achilles can or cannot do is not deducible from mathematics.  It depends only on what the relevant laws of physics say. If they say  that he will overtake the tortoise in a given time, then overtake it he  will. If that happens to involve an infinite number of steps of the form  ‘move to a particular location’, then an infinite number of such steps  will happen. If it involves his passing through an uncountable infinity  of points, then that is what he does. But nothing  physically  infinite has  happened. Thus the laws of physics determine the distinction not only between  183 A Window on Infinity rare and common, probable and improbable, fine-tuned or not, but  even between finite and infinite. Just as the  same set  of universes can  be packed with astrophysicists when measured under one set of laws  of physics but have almost none when measured under another, so  exactly the same sequence of events can be finite or infinite depending  on what the laws of physics are. Zeno’s mistake has been made with various other mathematical  abstractions too. In general terms, the mistake is to confuse an abstract  attribute with a physical one of the same name. Since it is possible to  prove theorems about the mathematical attribute, which have the status  of absolutely necessary truths, one is then misled into assuming that  one possesses a priori knowledge about what the laws of physics must  say about the physical attribute. Another example was in geometry. For centuries, no clear distinction  was made between its status as a mathematical system and as a physical  theory – and at first that did little harm, because the rest of science was  very unsophisticated compared with geometry, and Euclid’s theory was  an excellent approximation for all purposes at the time. But then the  philosopher Immanuel Kant (1724–1804), who was well aware of the  distinction between the absolutely necessary truths of mathematics and  the contingent truths of science, nevertheless concluded that Euclid’s  theory of geometry was self-evidently true  of nature . Hence he believed  that it was impossible rationally to doubt that the angles of a real  triangle add up to 180 degrees. And in this way he elevated that formerly  harmless misconception into a central flaw in his philosophy, namely  the doctrine that certain truths about the physical world could be  ‘known a priori’ – that is to say, without doing science. And of course,  to make matters worse, by ‘known’ he unfortunately meant ‘justified’. Yet, even before Kant had declared it impossible to doubt that    the geometry of real space is Euclidean, mathematicians had already  doubted it. Soon afterwards the mathematician and physicist Carl  Friedrich Gauss went so far as to measure the angles of a large triangle  – but found no deviation from Euclid’s predictions. Eventually Einstein’s  theory of curved space and time, which contradicted Euclid’s, was  vindicated by experiments that were more accurate than Gauss’s. In  the space near the Earth, the angles of a large triangle can add up to  as much as 180.0000002 degrees, a variation from Euclid’s geometry  184 the beginning of infinity which, for instance, satellite navigation systems nowadays have to take  into account. In other situations – such as near black holes – the  differences between Euclidean and Einsteinian geometry are so pro  - found that they can no longer be described in terms of ‘deviations’ of  one from the other.  Another example of the same mistake was in computer science .  Turing initially set up the theory of computation not for the purpose  of building computers, but to investigate the nature of mathematical  proof. Hilbert in 1900 had challenged mathematicians to formulate a  rigorous theory of what constitutes a proof, and one of his conditions  was that proofs must be  finite : they must use only a fixed and finite  set of rules of inference; they must start with a finite number of finitely  expressed axioms, and they must contain only a finite number of  elementary steps – where the steps are themselves finite. Computations,  as understood in Turing’s theory, are essentially the same thing as  proofs: every valid proof can be converted to a computation that  computes the======================================================== found in the current user’s input. Weizenbaum was shocked that many people using  Eliza  were fooled  by it. So it had passed the Turing test – at least, in its most naive version.  Moreover, even after people had been told that it was not a genuine  AI, they would sometimes continue to have long conversations with it  about their personal problems, exactly as though they believed that it  understood them. Weizenbaum wrote a book,  Computer Power and  Human Reason  (1976), warning of the dangers of anthropomorphism  when computers seem to exhibit human-like functionality. However, anthropomorphism is not the main type of overconfidence  that has beset the field of AI. For example, in 1983 Douglas Hofstadter  was subjected to a friendly hoax by some graduate students. They  convinced him that they had obtained access to a government-run AI  program, and invited him to apply the Turing test to it. In reality, one  of the students was at the other end of the line, imitating an  Eliza  program. As Hofstadter relates in his book  Metamagical Themas   (1985), the student was from the outset displaying an implausible  degree of understanding of Hofstadter’s questions. For example, an  early exchange was: 150 the beginning of infinity hofstadter : What are ears? student : Ears are auditory organs found on animals. That is not a dictionary definition. So  something  must have processed  the meaning of the word ‘ears’ in a way that distinguished it from most  other nouns. Any one such exchange is easily explained as being due  to luck: the question must have matched one of the templates that the  programmer had provided, including customized information about  ears. But after half a dozen exchanges on different subjects, phrased  in different ways, such luck becomes a very bad explanation and the  game should have been up. But it was not. So the student became ever  bolder in his replies, until eventually he was making jokes directed  specifically at Hofstadter – which gave him away. As Hofstadter remarked, ‘In retrospect, I am quite amazed at how  much genuine intelligence I was willing to accept as somehow having  been implanted in the program . . . It is clear that I was willing to accept  a huge amount of fluidity as achievable in this day and age simply by  putting together a large bag of isolated tricks, kludges and hacks.’ The  fact was (and this alone should have alerted Hofstadter) that, nineteen  years after  Eliza , not one of the  Eliza -like programs of the day resembled  a person even slightly more than the original had. Although they were  able to parse sentences better, and had more pre-programmed templates  for questions and answers, that is almost no help in an extended  conversation on diverse subjects. The probability that the outputs of  such templates will continue to resemble the products of human  thought diminishes exponentially with the number of utterances. So  Hofstadter should have been able to pronounce quite soon that the  candidate had passed the Turing test – and that, because it nevertheless  sounded rather like  Eliza , it must be a person pretending to be a  computer program. Programs written today – a further twenty-six years later – are still  no better at the task of seeming to think than  Eliza  was. They are now  known as ‘chatbots’, and their main application is still amusement, both  directly and in computer games. They have also been used to pro            vide  friendly seeming interfaces to lists of ‘frequently asked questions’ about  subjects like how to operate computers. But I think that users find them  no more helpful than a searchable list of the questions and answers. In 1990 the inventor Hugh Loebner endowed a prize for passing the  151 Artificial Creativity Turing test, to be judged at an annual competition. Until the test is  passed, a lesser prize is awarded each year for the entry judged to be  closest to passing. The test is harder to implement than it may seem at  first. One issue is that requiring the program to  pretend  to be human  is both biased and not very relevant to whether it can think .  Yet, if it  does not pretend to be human, it will be easy to identify as a computer  regardless of its ability to think. A related difficulty is that the human  participant in the test might intentionally imitate a chatbot – as in the  Hofstadter hoax – and so spoil the test, which is based on comparing  the two. Should the rules nevertheless allow the human to do this, in  order to mitigate the previous problem?  Unfortunately, such subtleties are not relevant at the current state  of the art. This is well illustrated by the following excerpts from the  conversation with which the program  Elbot  won the (lesser) Loebner  prize in 2008: judge :   do you understand the point of a turing test? elbot :   There are some people who would not pass the Turing  test themselves. Why must they inflict it on  computers? judge :  I spose it is a little harsh elbot :   If we======================================================== past and would have in  the future.  But what use are explanations if they cannot make predictions and  so cannot be tested through experience, as they can be in science? This  is really the question: how is progress possible in philosophy? As I  discussed in Chapter 5, it is obtained by seeking good explanations.  The misconception that evidence can play no legitimate role in philo- sophy is a relic of empiricism. Objective progress is indeed possible in  politics just as it is in morality generally and in science. Political philosophy traditionally centred on a collection of issues  that Popper called the ‘who should rule?’ question. Who should wield  power? Should it be a monarch or aristocrats, or priests, or a dictator,  or a small group, or ‘the people’, or their delegates? And that leads to  210 the beginning of infinity derivative questions such as ‘How should a king be educated?’ ‘Who  should be enfranchised in a democracy?’ ‘How does one ensure an  informed and responsible electorate?’ Popper pointed out that this class of questions is rooted in the same  misconception as the question ‘How are scientific theories derived from  sensory data?’ which defines empiricism. It is seeking a system that  derives  or justifies the right choice of leader or government, from  existing data – such as inherited entitlements, the opinion of the  majority, the manner in which a person has been educated, and so on.  The same misconception also underlies blind optimism and pessimism:  they both expect progress to be made by applying a simple rule to  existing knowledge, to establish which future possibilities to ignore  and which to rely on. Induction, instrumentalism and even Lamarckism  all make the same mistake: they expect  explanationless progress.  They  expect knowledge to be created by fiat with few errors, and not by a  process of variation and selection that is making a continual stream  of errors and correcting them. The defenders of hereditary monarchy doubted that any method of  selection of a leader by means of rational thought and debate could  improve upon a fixed, mechanical criterion. That was the precautionary  principle in action, and it gave rise to the usual ironies. For instance,  whenever pretenders to a throne claimed to have a better hereditary  entitlement than the incumbent, they were in effect citing the precaution- ary principle as a justification for sudden, violent, unpredictable change  – in other words, for blind optimism. The same was true whenever  monarchs happened to favour radical change themselves. Consider also  the revolutionary utopians, who typically achieve only destruction and  stagnation. Though they are blind optimists, what defines them as  utopians is their pessimism that their supposed utopia, or their violent  proposals for achieving and entrenching it, could ever be improved upon.  Additionally, they are revolutionaries in the first place because they are  pessimistic that many other people can be persuaded of the final truth  that they think they know. Ideas have consequences, and the ‘who should rule?’ approach to  political philosophy is not just a mistake of academic analysis: it has  been part of practically every bad political doctrine in history. If the  political process is seen as an engine for putting the right rulers in  211 Optimism power, then it justifies violence, for until that right system is in place,  no ruler is legitimate; and once it is in place, and its designated rulers  are ruling, opposition to them is opposition to rightness. The problem  then becomes how to thwart anyone who is working against the rulers  or their policies. By the same logic, everyone who thinks that existing  rulers or policies are bad must infer that the ‘who should rule?’ question  has been answered wrongly, and therefore that the power of the rulers  is not legitimate, and that opposing it is legitimate, by force if necessary.  Thus the very question ‘Who should rule?’ begs for violent, authoritarian  answers, and has often received them. It leads those in power into  tyranny, and to the entrenchment of bad rulers and bad policies; it  leads their opponents to violent destructiveness and revolution. Advocates of violence usually have in mind that none of those  things need happen if only everyone agreed on who should rule. But  that means agreeing about what is right, and, given agreement on  that, rulers would then have nothing to do. And, in any case, such  agreement is neither possible nor desirable: people are different, and  have unique ideas; problems are inevitable, and progress consists of  solving them. Popper therefore applies his basic ‘how can we detect and eliminate  errors?’ to political philosophy in the form  how can we rid ourselves  of bad governments without violence?  Just as science seeks explanations  that are experimentally testable, so a rational political system makes  it as easy as possible to detect, and persuade others, that a leader or======================================================== begin  new lives as separate people, or they may merge with their originals.  The latter option violates the principle of the conservation of mass,  among other laws of physics. But, again, this is fiction. Nevertheless, there is a certain category of rather pedantic science  fiction enthusiasts, myself included, who prefer the fictional science to  make sense – to consist of reasonably good explanations. Imagining  worlds with different laws of physics is one thing; imagining worlds  that do not make sense in their own terms is quite another. For instance,  we want to know how it can be that the exiles can see and hear the  ordinary world but not touch it. This attitude of ours was nicely  parodied in an episode of the television series  The Simpsons , in which  fans of a fantasy-adventure series question its star: 260 the beginning of infinity star: Next question. fan: Yes, over here. [ Clears throat .] In episode BF12, you were battling  barbarians while riding a wingèd Appaloosa, yet in the very next scene,  my dear, you’re clearly atop a wingèd Arabian. Please to explain it. star: Ah, yeah, well, whenever you notice something like that, a wizard  did it. fan: I see, all right, yes, but in episode AG4 – star: [ firmly ] Wizard. fan: Aw, for glayvin* out loud! Because that is a parody, the fan is complaining not about the story  itself, but only that there is a  continuity error : two horses were used  at different times to play the role of a single fictional horse. Neverthe- less, there are such things as flawed stories. Consider, for instance, a  story about a quest to discover whether winged horses are real, in  which the characters pursue that quest on winged horses. Though  logically consistent, such a story would not make sense in its own  terms, as an explanation. One could embed it in a context that would  make sense of it – for instance, it could be part of an allegory about  how people often fail to see the meaning of what is right there in front  of them. But in that case any merit in the story would still depend on  how the characters’ apparently nonsensical behaviour was  explicable   in terms of that allegory. Compare that with the explanation that ‘a  wizard did it.’ Since a wizard could equally well have been said to  conjure  any  events, in  any  story, it is a bad explanation; and that is  why the fan is exasperated by it.  In some stories the plot is not important: the story is really about  something else. But a good plot always rests, implicitly or explicitly,  on good explanations of how and why events happen, given its fictional  premises. In that case, even if those premises are about wizards, the  story is not really about the supernatural: it is about imaginary laws  of physics and imaginary societies, as well as real problems and true  ideas. As I shall explain in Chapter 14, not only do all good science- fiction plots resemble scientific explanation in this way, in the broadest  sense all good art does.  In that spirit, then, consider the fictional  doppelgänger s in the  *‘Glayvin’ is a term of indeterminate meaning, coined by  The Simpsons . 261 The Multiverse phantom zone. What enables them to  see  the ordinary world? Since  they are structurally identical to their originals, their eyes work by  absorbing light and detecting the resulting chemical changes, just as  real eyes do. But if they absorb some of the light coming from the  ordinary world, then they must cast shadows at the places where that  light would otherwise have arrived. Also, if the exiles in the phantom  zone can see each other, what light are they seeing with? The phantom  zone’s own light? If so, where does it come from? On the other hand, if the exiles can see  without  absorbing light,  then they must be differently constituted from their originals, at the  microscopic level. And in that case we no longer have an explanation  of why they outwardly resemble their originals: the ‘accidental-copying’  idea will no longer do: where did the transporter get the knowledge  required to build things that look and behave like human bodies, but  function internally in a different way? It would be a case of spontaneous  generation. Similarly, is there air in the phantom zone? If the exiles breathe air,  it can’t be the ship’s air, because they would be heard speaking or even  breathing. But nor can it be a copy of the small amount of air that was  in the transporter with them, because they are free to move around the  ship. So there must be a whole shipful of phantom-zone air. But then  what is preventing it from expanding out into space?  It seems that almost everything that happens in the story not only  conflicts with the real laws of physics (which is unexceptionable in  fiction), but raises problems within the fictional explanation. If the  doppelgängers  can walk through people, why do they not fall through  the floor? In reality, a floor supports people by bending slightly. But if  it were to bend in the======================================================== socrates: I do? hermes: Of  course.

Not least during this conversation!  hermes: W ell, this is not an attribute of philosophical ideas only, but  of all ideas. Remember when you all got lost on your way here from  the ship? And why? socrates: It  was because – as we realized with hindsight – we  completely misunderstood the directions given to us by the captain. hermes: So,  when you got the wrong idea of what he meant, despite  having listened attentively to every word he said,  where did that  wrong idea come from ? Not from him, presumably . . . socrates: I  see. It must come from within ourselves. It must be a  guess. Though, until this moment, it had never even remotely occurred  to me that I had been guessing. hermes: So  why would you expect that anything different happens  when you do understand someone correctly? socrates: I  see. When we hear something being said, we  guess  what  it means, without realizing what we are doing. That is beginning to  make sense to me.      Except – guesswork isn’t knowledge!  hermes:  Indeed, most guesses are not new knowledge. Although  guesswork is the  origin  of all knowledge, it is also a source of error,  and therefore what happens to an idea  after  it has been guessed is  crucial. socrates: So –  let me combine that insight with what I know of  240 the beginning of infinity criticism. A guess might come from a dream, or it might just be a  wild speculation or random combination of ideas, or anything. But  then we do not just accept it blindly or because we imagine it is  ‘authorized’, or because we  want  it to be true. Instead we criticize  it and try to discover its flaws. hermes: Yes.  That is what you  should  do, at any rate. socrates:  Then we try to remedy those flaws by altering the idea,  or dropping it in favour of others – and the alterations and other  ideas are themselves guesses. And are themselves criticized. Only  when we fail in these attempts either to reject or to improve an idea  do we provisionally accept it. hermes:  That can work. Unfortunately, people do not always do  what can work. socrates: Thank you, Hermes. It is exciting to learn of this single  process through which all knowledge originates, whether it is our  knowledge of a sea captain’s directions to Delphi, or knowledge of  right and wrong that we have carefully refined for years, or theorems  of arithmetic or geometry – or epistemology revealed to us by a    god – hermes: It  all comes from within, from conjecture and criticism. socrates: W ait! It comes from within,  even if revealed by a god ? hermes:  And is just as fallible as ever. Yes. Your argument covers that  case just like any other. socrates:  Marvellous! But now – what about objects that we just  experience  in the natural world. We reach out and touch an object,  and hence experience it  out there.  Surely that is a different kind of  knowledge, a kind which – fallible or not – really does come from  without, at least in the sense that our own experience is out there,  at the location of the object.* hermes: You  loved the idea that all those other different kinds of  knowledge originate in the same way, and are improved in the same  way. Why is ‘direct’ sensory experience an exception? What if it just  seems  radically different?  *The ancient Greeks were not very clear about where sensory experiences are located.  Even in the case of vision, many in Socrates’ time believed that the eye  emits  some- thing like light, and that the sensation of seeing an object consists of some sort of  interaction between the object and that light. 241 A Dream of Socrates socrates:  But surely you are now asking me to believe in a sort of  all-encompassing conjuring trick, resembling the fanciful notion that  the whole of life is really a dream. For it would mean that the  sensation of touching an object does not happen where we experience  it happening, namely in the hand that touches, but in the mind –  which I believe is located somewhere in the brain. So all my sen  - sations of touch are located inside my skull, where in reality nothing  can touch while I still live. And whenever I think I am seeing a vast,  brilliantly illuminated landscape, all that I am really experiencing    is likewise located entirely inside my skull, where in reality it is  constantly dark! hermes: Is  that so absurd? Where do you think all the sights and  sounds of  this   dream  are located? socrates: I  accept that  they  are indeed in my mind. But that is my  point: most dreams portray things that are simply not there in the  external reality. To portray things that  are  there is surely impossible  without some input that does not come from the mind but from  those things======================================================== myriad  individuals who can conceive of no improvement of themselves  nevertheless add up to a  city  that relentlessly seeks nothing else for  itself, day and night.  chaerephon: Yes, I  see.  socrates: In  Sparta there are no such politicians, and no such  sophists. And no gadflies such as me, because any Spartan who did  doubt or disapprove of the way things have always been done would  keep it to himself. What few new ideas they have are intended to  sustain the city more securely in its current state. As for war, I know  that there are Spartans who glory in war, and would love to conquer  and enslave the whole world, just as they once set out to conquer  their neighbours. Yet the institutions of their city, and the deep  assumptions that are built into the minds of even the hotheads,  embody a visceral fear of any such step into the unknown. Perhaps  it is significant that the statue of Ares that stands outside Sparta  represents him  chained , so that he will always be there to protect  the city. Is that not the same as preventing the god of violence from  breaking discipline? From being loosed upon the world to cause  random mayhem, with its terrifying risk of change? chaerephon:  Perhaps it is. In any case, I understand now, Socrates,  how a city can have ‘overarching concerns’ that are not shared by  all its citizens. However, I’m afraid I still don’t see how your theory  accounts for the  enmity  between our cities. First of all, I cannot recall  the Spartans ever objecting to our propensity to improve ourselves.  Instead, they cite all sorts of specific grievances about how we are  allegedly violating treaties, undermining their allies, plotting to build  249 A Dream of Socrates an empire on the mainland and so on. Second – not that I want to  criticize the god, of course! – socrates: It is  not impious to criticize the gods, Chaerephon, but  rational. Hermes thinks so too, for what it’s worth . . . plato : [ Scribbles,   ‘It is not impious to criticize gods.’ ] chaerephon: W ell, even if the god is right about those two ‘over- arching concerns’ of stasis and improvement, each city holds its  respective concern  only for itself.  It has no ambition to impose it  on anyone else. So, although Athens chooses to race forwards  while Sparta chooses to tie itself down, and although these choices  may logically be ‘opposite’, how can they possibly be a source of  enmity ? socrates: My  guess is this. The very existence of Athens, however  peaceful, is a deadly threat to Sparta’s stasis. And therefore, in the  long run, the condition for the continued stasis of Sparta (which  means its continued  existence , as they see it) is the destruction of  progress in Athens (which from our perspective would constitute  the destruction of Athens).  chaerephon: I  still do not see specifically what the threat is. socrates: W ell, suppose that in future both cities were to continue  to succeed with their overarching concerns. The Spartans would  stay exactly as they are now. But we Athenians are already the envy  of other Greeks with our wealth and diverse achievements. What  will happen when we improve further, and begin to outshine  everyone in the world  at  everything ? Spartans seldom travel or  interact with foreigners, but they cannot keep themselves entirely  in ignorance of developments elsewhere. Even going to war gives  them some inkling of what life is like in other cities that are  wealthier, and freer, than they. One day, some Spartan youths  visiting Delphi will find that it is the Athenians who have the    better ‘moves’ and the greater skill. And what if, in a generation  or two, Athenian warriors have developed some better ‘moves’  on  the battlefield ?  plato : But, Socrates, even if this is true, the Spartans are unaware of  it! So how can they fear it? socrates:  They need no prescience. Do you think that a Spartan  messenger, on reaching Athens, does not gasp in admiration like  250 the beginning of infinity everyone else when he sees what stands on our Acropolis?* And,  however much he may mutter (perhaps justly) about our hubris and  irresponsibility, do you think that he does not reflect, on his way  home, that his city can never and will never attract that sort of  admiration from anyone? Do you think that the Spartan elders are  not at this very moment worrying about the growing reputation of  democracy  in many cities, including some of their allies?      By the way, we ourselves should be at least as wary of democracy  as I think the Spartans are of bloodlust and battle rage, for it is  intrinsically as dangerous. We could not do without our democracy  any more than the Spartans could do without their military training.  And, just as they have moderated the destructiveness of bloodlust  through their traditions of discipline and caution, we have moderated  the destructiveness of democracy through our traditions of virtue,  tolerance and liberty. We are utterly dependent on those======================================================== brain. Also, Darwin’s theory of evolution had not yet  been published, and supernatural accounts of the nature of human  beings were still prevalent. Today there is less mitigation for the minority  of scientists and philosophers who still believe that AI is unattainable.  For instance, the philosopher John Searle has placed the AI project in  the following historical perspective: for centuries, some people have  tried to explain the mind in mechanical terms, using similes and  metaphors based on the most complex machines of the day. First the  brain was supposed to be like an immensely complicated set of gears  and levers. Then it was hydraulic pipes, then steam engines, then  telephone ex      changes – and, now that computers are our most impressive  technology, brains are said to be computers. But this is still no more  than a metaphor, says Searle, and there is no more reason to expect the  brain to be a computer than a steam engine. But there is. A steam engine is not a universal simulator. But a  computer is, so expecting it to be able to do whatever neurons can is  not a metaphor: it is a known and proven property of the laws of  physics as best we know them. (And, as it happens, hydraulic pipes  could also be made into a universal classical computer, and so could  gears and levers, as Babbage showed.) Ironically, Lady Lovelace’s objection has almost the same logic as  Douglas Hofstadter’s argument for reductionism (Chapter 5) – yet  Hofstadter is one of today’s foremost  proponents  of the possibility of  AI. That is because both of them share the mistaken premise that  low-level computational steps cannot possibly add up to a higher-level  ‘I’ that affects anything. The difference between them is that they chose  opposite horns of the dilemma that that poses: Lovelace chose the false  conclusion that AI is impossible, while Hofstadter chose the false  conclusion that no such ‘I’ can exist.  Because of Babbage’s failure either to build a universal computer or  139 The Jump to Universality to persuade others to do so, an entire century would pass before the  first one was built. During that time, what happened was more like the  ancient history of universality: although calculating machines similar  to the Difference Engine were being built by others even before Babbage  had given up, the Analytical Engine was almost entirely ignored even  by mathematicians.  In 1936 Turing developed the definitive theory of universal classical  computers. His motivation was not to build such a computer, but only  to use the theory abstractly to study the nature of mathematical proof.  And when the first universal computers were built, a few years later,  it was, again, not out of any special intention to implement universality.  They were built in Britain and the United States during the Second  World War for specific wartime applications. The British computers,  named Colossus (in which Turing was involved), were used for code- breaking; the American one, ENIAC, was designed to solve the equations  needed for aiming large guns. The technology used in both was elec- tronic vacuum tubes, which acted like relays but about a hundred times  as fast. At the same time, in Germany, the engineer Konrad Zuse was  building a programmable calculator out of relays – just as Babbage  should have done. All three of these devices had the technological  features necessary to be a universal computer, but none of them was  quite configured for this. In the event, the Colossus machines never did  anything but code-breaking, and most were dismantled after the war.  Zuse’s machine was destroyed by Allied bombing. But ENIAC  was  allowed to jump to universality: after the war it was put to diverse uses  for which it had never been designed, such as weather forecasting and  the hydrogen-bomb project.  The history of electronic technology since the Second World War  has been dominated by miniaturization, with ever more microscopic  switches being implemented in each new device. These improve-  ments led to a jump to universality in about 1970, when several  companies independently produced a microprocessor, a universal  classical com  puter on a single silicon chip. From then on, designers  of  any  information-processing device could start with a microprocessor  and then customize it – program it – to perform the specific tasks  needed for that device. Today, your washing machine is almost certainly  controlled by a computer that could be programmed to do astrophysics  140 the beginning of infinity or word processing instead, if it were given suitable input–output  devices and enough memory to hold the necessary data.  It is a remarkable fact that, in that sense (that is to say, ignoring  issues of speed, memory capacity and input–output devices), the    human ‘computers’ of old, the steam-powered Analytical Engine with  its literal bells and whistles, the room-sized vacuum-tube computers  of the Second World War, and present-day======================================================== the idea of creativity is still rather confused by various mis  - conceptions. Empiricism miscasts science as an automatic, non-creative  process. And art, though acknowledged as ‘creative’, has often been  seen as the antithesis of science, and hence irrational, random, in    - explicable – and hence unjudgeable, and non-objective. But if beauty  is  objective, then a new work of art, like a newly discovered law of  nature or mathematical theorem, adds something irreducibly new to  the world.  We stare at the red traffic light because doing so will allow us to  continue our journey with the least possible delay. An animal can be  359 Why are Flowers Beautiful?  attracted towards another animal in order to mate with it, or to eat it.  Once the predator has taken a bite, it is attracted to take another –  unless the bite tastes bad, in which case it will be repelled. So there we  have a literal matter of taste. And that matter of taste is indeed caused  by the laws of physics in the form of the laws of chemistry and  biochemistry. We can guess that there is no higher-level explanation  of the resulting behaviour than the zoological level, because the be    - haviour is predictable. It is repetitive, and where it is not repetitive it  is random.  Art does not consist of repetition. But in human tastes there can be  genuine novelty. Because we are universal explainers, we are not simply  obeying our genes. For instance, humans often act in ways that are  contrary to any preferences that might plausibly have been built into  our genes. People fast – sometimes for aesthetic reasons. Some abstain  from sex. People act in very diverse ways for religious reasons or for  any number of other reasons, philosophical or scientific, practical or  whimsical. We have an inborn aversion to heights and to falling, yet  people go skydiving – not in spite of this feeling, but because of it. It  is that very feeling of inborn aversion that humans can reinterpret into  a larger picture which to them is attractive – they want more of it; they  want to appreciate it more deeply. To a skydiver, the vista from which  we were born to recoil is beautiful. The whole activity of skydiving is  beautiful, and part of that beauty is in the very sensations that evolved  to deter us from trying it. The conclusion is inescapable: that attraction  is not inborn, just as the contents of a newly discovered law of physics  or mathematical theorem are not inborn.  Could it be purely cultural? We pursue beauty as well as truth, and  in both cases we can be fooled. Perhaps we see a face as beautiful  because it really is, or perhaps it is only because of a combination of  our genes and our culture. A beetle is attracted to another beetle that  you and I may see as hideous. But not if you are an entomologist.  People can  learn  to see many things as beautiful or ugly. But, there  again, people can also learn to see false scientific theories as true, and  true ones as false, yet there is such a thing as objective scientific truth.  So that still does not tell us whether there is such a thing as objective  beauty. 360 the beginning of infinity Now, why is a flower the shape that it is? Because the relevant genes  evolved to make it attractive to insects. Why would they do this?  Because when insects visit a flower they are dusted with pollen, which  they then deposit in other flowers of the same species, and so the    genes in the DNA in that pollen are spread far and wide. This is the  reproductive mechanism that flowering plants evolved and which most  still use today: before there were insects, there were no flowers on  Earth. But the mechanism could work only because insects, at the    same time, evolved genes that attracted them to flowers. Why did    they? Because flowers provide nectar, which is food. Just as there is  co-evolution between the genes to coordinate mating behaviours in  males and females of the same species, so genes for making flowers  and giving them their shapes and colours co-evolved with genes in  insects for recognizing flowers with the best nectar.  During that biological co-evolution, just as in the history of art,  criteria  evolved, and  means of meeting those criteria  co-evolved with  them. That is what gave flowers the knowledge of how to attract insects,  and insects the knowledge of how to recognize those flowers and the  propensity to fly towards them. But what is surprising is that these    same flowers  also attract humans . This is so familiar a fact that it is hard to see how amazing it is. But  think of all the countless hideous animals in nature, and think also that  all of them who find their mates by sight have evolved to find that  appearance attractive. And therefore it is not surprising that we do not.  With predators and prey there is a similar co-evolution, but in a  361 Why are Flowers Beautiful?  competitive sense rather than a cooperative one: each has genes that  evolved to enable it to recognize======================================================== position of the  moon in the sky does not repeat itself once a year, and because the  sun’s rays heating the Earth are integral to the explanation. Nor could  one easily incorporate any stories about how the sun god feels about  all this, because if the true explanation of winter is in the geometry of  the Earth–sun motion, then how anyone feels about it is irrelevant,  and if there were some flaw in that explanation, then no story about  how anyone felt would put it right.  The axis-tilt theory also predicts that the seasons will be out of phase  in the two hemispheres. So if they had been found to be in phase, the  25 The Reach of Explanations theory would have been refuted, just as, in the event, the Persephone  and Freyr myths were refuted by the opposite observation. But the  difference is, if the axis-tilt theory had been refuted, its defenders would  have had nowhere to go. No easily implemented change could make  tilted axes cause the same seasons all over the planet. Fundamentally  new ideas would have been needed. That is what makes good ex    - planations essential to science: it is only when a theory is a good  explanation – hard to vary – that it even matters whether it is testable.  Bad explanations are equally useless whether they are testable or not.  Most accounts of the differences between myth and science make  too much of the issue of testability – as if the ancient Greeks’ great  mistake was that they did not send expeditions to the southern hemi- sphere to observe the seasons. But in fact they could never have guessed  that such an expedition might provide evidence about seasons unless  they had already guessed that seasons would be out of phase in the  two hemispheres – and if that guess was hard to vary, which it could  have been only if it had been part of a good explanation. If their guess  was  easy  to vary, they might just as well have saved themselves the  boat fare, stayed at home, and tested the easily testable theory that  winter can be staved off by yodelling.  So long as they had no better explanation than the Persephone myth,  there should have been no need for testing. Had they been seeking good  explanations, they would immediately have tried to improve upon the  myth, without testing it. That is what we do today. We do not test every  testable theory, but only the few that we find are good explanations.  Science would be impossible if it were not for the fact that the over- whelming majority of false theories can be rejected out of hand without  any experiment, simply for being bad explanations. Good explanations are often strikingly simple or elegant – as I shall  discuss in Chapter 14. Also, a common way in which an explanation  can be bad is by containing superfluous features or arbitrariness, and  sometimes removing those yields a good explanation. This has given  rise to a misconception known as ‘Occam’s razor’ (named after the  fourteenth-century philosopher William of Occam, but dating back  to antiquity), namely that one should always seek the ‘simplest ex    - planation’. One statement of it is ‘Do not multiply assumptions beyond  necessity.’ However, there are plenty of very simple explanations that  26 the beginning of infinity are nevertheless easily variable (such as ‘Demeter did it’). And, while  assumptions ‘beyond necessity’ make a theory bad by definition, there  have been many mistaken ideas of what is ‘necessary’ in a theory.  Instrumentalism, for instance, considers explanation itself unnecessary,  and so do many other bad philosophies of science, as I shall discuss  in Chapter 12. When a formerly good explanation has been falsified by new  observations, it is no longer a good explanation, because the problem  has expanded to include those observations. Thus the standard  scientific methodology of dropping theories when refuted by experi- ment is implied by the requirement for good explanations. The best  explanations are the ones that are most constrained by existing know- ledge – including other good explanations as well as other knowledge  of the phenomena to be explained. That is why testable explanations  that have passed stringent tests become extremely good explanations,  which is in turn why the maxim of testability promotes the growth  of knowledge in science. Conjectures are the products of creative imagination. But the problem  with imagination is that it can create fiction much more easily than  truth. As I have suggested, historically, virtually all human attempts to  explain experience in terms of a wider reality have indeed been fiction,  in the form of myths, dogma and mistaken common sense – and the  rule of testability is an insufficient check on such mistakes. But the  quest for good explanations does the job: inventing falsehoods is easy,  and therefore they are easy to vary once found; discovering good  explanations is hard, but the harder they are to find, the harder they  are to vary once found. The ideal that explanatory======================================================== then  explained seasons. And, without any further modification, it also  explained why seasons are out of phase in the two hemispheres, and  why tropical regions do not have them, and why the summer sun shines  at midnight in polar regions – three phenomena of which its creators  may well have been unaware.  The reach of an explanation is not a ‘principle of induction’; it is not  something that the creator of the explanation can use to obtain or justify  it. It is not part of the creative process at all. We find out about it only  after we have the explanation – sometimes long after. So it has nothing  to do with ‘extrapolation’, or ‘induction’, or with ‘deriving’ a theory in  any other alleged way. It is exactly the other way round: the reason that  the explanation of seasons reaches far outside the experience of its  29 The Reach of Explanations creators is precisely that it  does not  have to be extrapolated. By its  nature as an explanation, when its creators first thought of it, it already  applied in our planet’s other hemisphere, and throughout the solar  system, and in other solar systems, and at other times.  Thus the reach of an explanation is neither an additional assumption  nor a detachable one. It is determined by the content of the explanation  itself. The better an explanation is, the more rigidly its reach is determined  – because the harder it is to vary an explanation, the harder it is in  particular to construct a variant with a different reach, whether larger  or smaller, that is still an explanation. We expect the law of gravity to  be the same on Mars as on Earth because only one viable explanation  of gravity is known – Einstein’s general theory of relativity – and that  is a universal theory; but we do not expect the  map  of Mars to resemble  the map of Earth, because our theories about how Earth looks, despite  being excellent explanations, have no reach to the appearance of any  other astronomical object. Always, it is explanatory theories that tell  us which (usually few) aspects of one situation can be ‘extrapolated’    to others. It also makes sense to speak of the reach of non-explanatory forms  of knowledge – rules of thumb, and also knowledge that is implicit in  the genes for biological adaptations. So, as I said, my rule of thumb  about cups-and-balls tricks has reach to a certain class of tricks; but I  could not know what that class is without the explanation for why the  rule works.  Old ways of thought, which did not seek good explanations, permitted  no process such as science for correcting errors and misconceptions.  Improvements happened so rarely that most people never experienced  one. Ideas were static for long periods. Being bad explanations, even  the best of them typically had little reach and were therefore brittle and  unreliable beyond, and often within, their traditional applications. When  ideas did change, it was seldom for the better, and when it did happen  to be for the better, that seldom increased their reach. The emergence  of science, and more broadly what I am calling the Enlightenment, was  the beginning of the end of such static, parochial systems of ideas. It  initiated the present era in human history, unique for its sustained, rapid  creation of knowledge with ever-increasing reach. Many have wondered  how long this can continue. Is it inherently bounded? Or is this the  30 the beginning of infinity beginning of infinity – that is to say, do these methods have unlimited  potential to create further knowledge? It may seem paradoxical to claim  anything so grand (even if only potentially) on behalf of a project that  has swept away all the ancient myths that used to assign human beings  a special significance in the scheme of things. For if the power of the  human faculties of reason and creativity, which have driven the En    - lightenment, were indeed unlimited, would humans not have just such  a significance?  And yet, as I mentioned at the beginning of this chapter, gold can  be created only by stars and by intelligent beings. If you find a nugget  of gold anywhere in the universe, you can be sure that in its history  there was either a supernova or an intelligent being with an explanation.  And if you find an explanation anywhere in the universe, you know  that there must have been an intelligent being. A supernova alone  would not suffice.  But – so what? Gold is important  to us , but in the cosmic scheme  of things it has little significance. Explanations are important to us:  we need them to survive. But is there anything significant, in the cosmic  scheme of things, about explanation, that apparently puny physical  process that happens inside brains? I shall address that question in  Chapter 3, after some reflections about appearance and reality. terminology Explanation  Statement about what is there, what it does, and how  and why. Reach  The ability of some explanations to solve problems beyond  those that they were created to======================================================== evidence’ (evidence about unwitnessed events) is ‘a very tricky thing  . . . It may seem to point very straight to one thing, but if you shift  your own point of view a little, you may find it pointing in an equally  uncompromising manner to something entirely different . . . There is  nothing more deceptive than an obvious fact.’ The same holds for  scientific discovery. And that again raises the question: how do we  know? If all our theories originate locally, as guesswork in our own  minds, and can be tested only locally, by experience, how is it that they  contain such extensive and accurate knowledge about the reality that  we have never experienced?  *The term was coined by the philosopher Norwood Russell Hanson. 11 The Reach of Explanations I am not asking what authority scientific knowledge is derived from,  or rests on. I mean, literally, by what process do ever truer and more  detailed explanations about the world come to be represented physically  in our brains? How do we come to know about the interactions of  subatomic particles during transmutation at the centre of a distant star,  when even the tiny trickle of light that reaches our instruments from  the star was emitted by glowing gas at the star’s surface, a million  kilometres above where the transmutation is happening? Or about  conditions in the fireball during the first few seconds after the Big Bang,  which would instantly have destroyed any sentient being or scientific  instrument? Or about the future, which we have no way of measuring  at all? How is it that we can predict, with some non-negligible degree  of confidence, whether a new design of microchip will work, or whether  a new drug will cure a particular disease, even though they have never  existed before? For most of human history, we did not know how to do any of this.  People were not designing microchips or medications or even the wheel.  For thousands of generations, our ancestors looked up at the night sky  and wondered what stars are – what they are made of, what makes  them shine, what their relationship is with each other and with us –  which was exactly the right thing to wonder about. And they were  using eyes and brains anatomically indistinguishable from those of  modern astronomers. But they discovered nothing about it. Much the  same was true in every other field of knowledge. It was not for lack of  trying, nor for lack of thinking. People observed the world. They    tried to understand it – but almost entirely in vain. Occasionally they  recognized simple patterns in the appearances. But when they tried to  find out what was really there behind those appearances, they failed  almost completely.  I expect that, like today, most people wondered about such things  only occasionally – during breaks from addressing their more parochial  concerns. But their parochial concerns  also  involved yearning to  know – and not only out of pure curiosity. They wished they knew  how to safeguard their food supply; how they could rest when tired  without risking starvation; how they could be warmer, cooler, safer, in  less pain – in every aspect of their lives, they wished they knew how  to make progress. But, on the timescale of individual lifetimes, they  12 the beginning of infinity almost never made any. Discoveries such as fire, clothing, stone    tools, bronze, and so on, happened so rarely that from an individual’s  point of view the world never improved. Sometimes people even  realized (with somewhat miraculous prescience) that making progress  in practical ways would  depend  on progress in understanding puzzling  phenomena in the sky. They even conjectured links between the two,  such as myths, which they found compelling enough to dominate their  lives – yet which still bore no resemblance to the truth. In short, they  wanted to create knowledge, in order to make progress, but they did  not know how.  This was the situation from our species’ earliest prehistory, through  the dawn of civilization, and through its imperceptibly slow increase  in sophistication – with many reverses – until a few centuries ago. Then  a powerful new mode of discovery and explanation emerged, which  later became known as  science . Its emergence is known as the  scientific  revolution , because it succeeded almost immediately in creating know- ledge at a noticeable rate, which has increased ever since.  What had changed? What made science effective at understanding  the physical world when all previous ways had failed? What were  people now doing, for the first time, that made the difference? This  question began to be asked as soon as science began to be successful,  and there have been many conflicting answers, some containing truth.  But none, in my view, has reached the heart of the matter. To explain  my own answer, I have to give a little context first. The scientific revolution was part of a wider intellectual revolution,  the  Enlightenment , which also brought progress in other======================================================== later survival will depend on being able to  cope when prevention and delaying tactics have failed. Obviously we  need to work towards cures. But we can do that only for diseases that  we already know about. So we need the capacity to deal with unfore- seen, unforeseeable failures. For this we need a large and vibrant  research community, interested in explanation and problem-solving.  We need the wealth to fund it, and the technological capacity to  implement what it discovers. This is also true of the problem of climate change, about which there  is currently great controversy. We face the prospect that carbon-dioxide  emissions from technology will cause an increase in the average temp- erature of the atmosphere, with harmful effects such as droughts,  sea-level rises, disruption to agriculture, and the extinctions of some  species. These are forecast to outweigh the beneficial effects, such as  an increase in crop yields, a general boost to plant life, and a reduction  in the number of people dying of hypothermia in winter. Trillions of  dollars, and a great deal of legislation and institutional change, in    - tended to reduce those emissions, currently hang on the outcomes of  simulations of the planet’s climate by the most powerful supercomputers,  and on projections by economists about what those computations  imply about the economy in the next century. In the light of the above  discussion, we should notice several things about the controversy and  about the underlying problem. First, we have been lucky so far. Regardless of how accurate the  prevailing climate models are, it is uncontroversial from the laws of  physics, without any need for supercomputers or sophisticated model- ling, that such emissions  must ,  eventually ,   increase the temperature,  which must, eventually, be harmful. Consider, therefore: what if the  relevant parameters had been just slightly different and the moment  of disaster had been in, say, 1902 – Veblen’s time – when carbon-  dioxide emissions were already orders of magnitude above their  pre-Enlightenment values. Then the disaster would have happened  438 the beginning of infinity before anyone could have predicted it or known what was happening.  Sea levels would have risen, agriculture would have been disrupted,  millions would have begun to die, with worse to come. And the great  issue of the day would have been not how to prevent it but what could  be done about it .  They had no supercomputers then. Because of Babbage’s failures  and the scientific community’s misjudgements – and, perhaps most  importantly, their lack of wealth –  they lacked the vital technology of  automated computing altogether. Mechanical calculators and roomfuls  of clerks would have been insufficient. But, much worse: they had  almost no atmospheric physicists. In fact the total number of physicists  of all kinds was a small fraction of the number who today work on  climate change alone. From society’s point of view, physicists were a  luxury in 1902, like colour televisions were in the 1970s. Yet, to recover  from the disaster, society would have needed more scientific knowledge,  and better technology, and more of it – that is to say, more wealth. For  instance, in 1900, building a sea wall to protect the coast of a low-lying  island would have required resources so enormous that the only islands  that could have afforded it would have been those with either large  concentrations of cheap labour or exceptional wealth, as in the Nether- lands, much of whose population already lived below sea level thanks  to the technology of dyke-building.  This is a challenge that is highly susceptible to automation. But people  were in no position to address it in that way. All relevant machines were  underpowered, unreliable, expensive, and impossible to produce in large  numbers. An enormous effort to construct a Panama canal had just failed  with the loss of thousands of lives and vast amounts of money, due to  inadequate technology and scientific know  ledge. And, to compound  those problems, the world as a whole had very little wealth by today’s  standards. Today, a coastal defence project would be well within the  capabilities of almost any coastal nation – and would add decades to  the time available to find other solutions to rising sea levels. If none are found, what would we do  then ? That is a question of a  wholly different kind, which brings me to my second observation on  the climate-change controversy. It is that, while the supercomputer  simulations make (conditional)  predictions , the economic forecasts  make almost pure  prophecies . For we can expect the future of human  439 Unsustainable responses to climate to depend heavily on how successful people are  at creating new knowledge to address the problems that arise. So  comparing predictions with prophecies is going to lead to that same  old mistake.  Again, suppose that disaster had already been under way in 1902.  Consider======================================================== entrenched racial divisions, or various traditions of political violence.  Hence I do not intend the above discussion of electoral systems to  constitute a blanket endorsement of plurality voting as the One True  System of democracy, suitable for all polities under all circumstances.  Even democracy itself is unworkable under some circumstances. But  in the advanced political cultures of the Enlightenment tradition the  creation of knowledge can and should be paramount, and the idea that  representative government depends on proportionate representation  in the legislature is unequivocally a mistake. In the United States’ system of government, the Senate is required  to be representative in a different sense from the House of Represen- tatives:  states  are represented equally, in recognition of the fact that  each state is a separate political entity with its own distinctive political  and legal tradition. Each of them is entitled to two Senate seats,  regardless of population. Because the states differ greatly in their  populations (currently the most populous state, California, has    nearly seventy times the population of the least populous, Wyoming),  the Senate’s apportionment rule creates enormous deviations from  population-based proportionality – much larger than those that are  so hotly disputed in regard to the House of Representatives. And yet  350 the beginning of infinity historically, after elections, it is rare for the Senate and the House of  Representatives to be controlled by different parties. This suggests that  there is more going on in this vast process of apportionments and  elections than merely ‘representation’ – the mirroring of the population  by the legislature. Could it be that the problem-solving that is promoted  by the plurality voting system is continually changing the  options  of  the voters, and also their  preferences  among the options, through  persuasion? And so opinions  and preferences are, despite appear  ances,  converging  – not in the sense of there being less disagreement (since  solutions create new problems), but in the sense of creating ever more  shared knowledge. In science, we do not consider it surprising that a community of  scientists with different initial hopes and expectations, continually in  dispute about their rival theories, gradually come into near-unanimous  agreement over a steady stream of issues (yet still continue to disagree  all the time). It is not surprising because, in their case, there are  observable facts that they can use to test their theories. They converge  with each other on any given issue because they are all converging on  the objective truth. In politics it is customary to be cynical about that  sort of convergence being possible.  But that is a pessimistic view. Throughout the West, a great deal of  philosophical knowledge that is nowadays taken for granted by almost  everyone – say, that slavery is an abomination, or that women should  be free to go out to work, or that autopsies should be legal, or that  promotion in the armed forces should not depend on skin colour – was  highly controversial only a matter of decades ago, and originally the  opposite positions were taken for granted. A successful truth-seeking  system works its way towards broad consensus or near-unanimity – the  one state of public opinion that is not subject to decision-theoretic  paradoxes and where ‘the will of the people’ makes sense. So conver- gence in the broad consensus over time is made possible by the fact  that all concerned are gradually eliminating errors in their positions  and converging on objective truths. Facilitating that process – by  meeting Popper’s criterion as well as possible – is more important than  which of two contending factions with near-equal support gets its way  at a particular election. In regard to the apportionment issue too, since the United States’  351 Choices Constitution was instituted there have been enormous changes in    the prevailing conception of what it means for a government to be  ‘representative’. Recognizing the right of women to vote, for instance,  doubled the number of voters – and implicitly admitted that in every  previous election half the population had been disenfranchised, and  the other half over-represented compared with a just representation.  In numerical terms, such injustices dwarf all the injustices of apportion- ment that have absorbed so much political energy over the centuries.  But it is to the credit of the political system, and of the people of the  United States and of the West in general, that, while they were fiercely  debating the fairness of shifting a few percentage points’ worth of  representation between one state and another, they were also debating,  and making, these momentous improvements. And they too became  uncontroversial. Apportionment systems, electoral systems and other institutions of  human cooperation were for the most part designed, or evolved, to  cope======================================================== with day-to-day controversy, to cobble together ways of proceed- ing without violence despite intense disagreement about what would  be best. And the best of them succeed as well as they do because they  have, often unintentionally, implemented solutions with enormous  reach. Consequently, coping with controversy in the present has become  merely a means to an end. The purpose of deferring to the majority in  democratic systems should be to approach unanimity in the future,    by giving all concerned the incentive to abandon bad ideas and to  conjecture better ones. Creatively  changing the options  is what allows  people in real life to cooperate in ways that no-go theorems seem to  say are impossible; and it is what allows individual minds to choose  at all. The growth of the body of knowledge about which there is  unanimous agreement does not entail a dying-down of controversy:  on the contrary, human beings will never disagree any less than they  do now, and that is a very good thing. If those institutions do, as they  seem to, fulfil the hope that it is possible for changes to be for the  better, on balance, then human life can improve without limit as we  advance from misconception to ever better misconception. 352 the beginning of infinity terminology Representative government  A system of government in which the  composition or opinions of the legislature reflect those of the people. Social-choice theory  The study of how the ‘will of society’ can be  defined in terms of the wishes of its members, and of what social  institutions can cause society to enact its will, thus defined. Popper’s criterion   Good political institutions are those that make it  as easy as possible to detect whether a ruler or policy is a mistake,  and to remove rulers or policies without violence when they are. meanings of ‘the beginning of infinity’  encountered in this chapter – Choice that involves creating new options rather than weighing  existing ones. – Political institutions that meet Popper’s criterion. summary It is a mistake to conceive of choice and decision-making as a process  of selecting from existing options according to a fixed formula. That  omits the most important element of decision-making, namely the  creation of new options. Good policies are hard to vary, and therefore  conflicting policies are discrete and cannot be arbitrarily mixed. Just  as rational thinking does not consist of weighing the justifications of  rival theories, but of using conjecture and criticism to seek the best  explanation, so coalition governments are not a desirable objective of  electoral systems. They should be judged by Popper’s criterion of how  easy they make it to remove bad rulers and bad policies. That designates  the plurality voting system as best in the case of advanced political  cultures. 353 14 Why are Flowers Beautiful?  My daughter Juliet, then aged six . . . pointed out some flowers  by the wayside. I asked her what she thought wildflowers were  for. She gave a rather thoughtful answer. ‘Two things,’ she said.  ‘To make the world pretty, and to help the bees make honey  for us.’ I was touched by this and sorry I had to tell her that it  wasn’t true. Richard Dawkins,  Climbing Mount Improbable  (1996) ‘Displace one note and there would be diminishment. Displace one  phrase and the structure would fall.’ That is how Mozart’s music is  described in Peter Shaffer’s 1979 play  Amadeus . This is reminiscent of  the remark by John Archibald Wheeler with which this book begins,  speaking of a hoped-for unified theory of fundamental physics: ‘an  idea so simple, so beautiful, that when we grasp it . . . how could it  have been otherwise?’ Shaffer and Wheeler were describing the same attribute: being hard  to vary while still doing the job. In the first case it is an attribute of  aesthetically good music, and in the second of good scientific ex  -  planations. And Wheeler speaks of the scientific theory as being  beautiful  in the same breath as describing it as hard to vary. Scientific theories are hard to vary because they correspond closely  with an objective truth, which is independent of our culture, our  personal preferences and our biological make-up. But what made Peter  Shaffer think that Mozart’s music is hard to vary? The prevailing view  among both artists and non-artists is, I think, that there is nothing  objective about artistic standards. Beauty, says the adage, is in the    354 the beginning of infinity eye of the beholder. The very phrase ‘It’s a matter of taste’ is used  interchangeably with ‘There is no objective truth of the matter.’ Artistic  standards are, in this view, nothing more than artefacts of fashion    and other cultural accidents, or of individual whim, or of biological  predisposition. Many are willing to concede that in science and math-  e  matics one idea can be objectively truer than another (though, as we  have seen, some deny even that), but most insist that there is no such======================================================== it misses and the rest strikes everywhere on  the exposed surface. Remember, this is just a single particle, which may  consist of fungible instances. The next thing that happens is that they  cease to be fungible, splitting through their interaction with atoms at  their points of arrival into a finite but huge number of instances, each  of which is the origin of a separate history. 294 the beginning of infinity In each such history, there is an autonomous instance of the cosmic- ray particle, which will dissipate its energy in creating a ‘cosmic-ray  shower’ of electrically charged particles. Thus, in different histories,  such a shower will occur at different locations. In some, that shower  will provide a conducting path down which a lightning bolt will travel.  Every atom on the surface of the Earth will be struck by such lightning  in  some  history. In other histories, one of those cosmic-ray particles  will strike a human cell, damaging some already damaged DNA in  such a way as to make the cell cancerous. Some non-negligible pro  - portion of all cancers are caused in this way. As a result, there exist  histories in which any given person, alive in our history at any time,  is killed soon afterwards by cancer. There exist other histories in which  the course of a battle, or a war, is changed by such an event, or by a  lightning bolt at exactly the right place and time, or by any of countless  other unlikely, ‘random’ events. This makes it highly plausible that  there exist histories in which events have played out more or less as  in alternative-history stories such as  Fatherland  and  Roma Eterna  – or  in which events in your own life played out very differently, for better  or worse. A great deal of fiction is therefore close to a fact somewhere in the  multiverse. But not all fiction. For instance, there are no histories in  which my stories of the transporter malfunction are true, because they  require different laws of physics. Nor are there histories in which the  fundamental constants of nature such as the speed of light or the charge  on an electron are different. There is, however, a sense in which different  laws of physics  appear  to be true for a period in some histories, because  of a sequence of ‘unlikely accidents’. (There may also be universes in  which there are different laws of physics, as required in anthropic  explanations of fine-tuning. But as yet there is no viable theory of such  a multiverse.) Imagine a single photon from a starship’s communication laser,  heading towards Earth. Like the cosmic ray, it arrives all over the  surface, in different histories. In each history, only one atom will absorb  the photon and the rest will initially be completely unaffected. A receiver  for such communications would then detect the relatively large, discrete  change undergone by such an atom. An important consequence for the  construction of measuring devices (including eyes) is that no matter  295 The Multiverse how far away the source is, the kick given to an atom by an arriving  photon is always the same: it is just that the weaker the signal is, the  fewer kicks there are. If this were not so – for instance, if classical physics  were true – weak signals would be much more easily swamped by  random local noise. This is the same as the advantage of digital over  analogue information processing that I discussed in Chapter 6. Some of my own research in physics has been concerned with the  theory of  quantum computers . These are computers in which the  information-carrying variables have been protected by a variety of  means from becoming entangled with their surroundings. This allows  a new mode of computation in which the flow of information is not  confined to a single history. In one type of quantum computation,  enormous numbers of different computations, taking place simul- taneously, can affect each other and hence contribute to the output of  a computation. This is known as  quantum parallelism . In a typical quantum computation, individual bits of information are  represented in physical objects known as ‘qubits’ – quantum bits – of  which there is a large variety of physical implementations but always  with two essential features. First, each qubit has a variable that can take  one of two discrete values, and, second, special measures are taken to  protect the qubits from entanglement – such as cooling them to  temperatures close to absolute zero. A typical algorithm using quantum  parallelism begins by causing the information-carrying variables in some  of the qubits to acquire both their values simultaneously. Con    sequently,  regarding those qubits as a register representing (say) a number, the  number of separate instances of the register as a whole is exponentially  large: two to the power of the number of qubits. Then, for a period,  classical computations are performed, during which waves of  differentiation spread to some of the other qubits – but no further,======================================================== chaos  outside  the sphere: almost a random state, since almost-random states  are by far the most numerous. A typical such state is not only amorphous  but hot. So in most such universes the very next thing that is going to  happen is that the chaotic radiation emanating from outside the sphere  will kill you instantly. At any given instant, the theory that we are going  to be killed a picosecond hence is refuted by observation a picosecond  later. Whereupon another such theory presents itself. So it is a very  bad explanation – an extreme version of the gambler’s hunches.  The same holds for purely anthropic explanations of all other fine-  tunings involving more than a handful of constants: such explanations  predict that it is overwhelmingly likely that we are in a universe in  which astrophysicists are only just possible and will cease to exist in  an instant. So they are bad explanations. On the other hand, if the laws of physics exist in only one  form ,  with only the values of a few constants differing from one universe to  another, then the very fact that laws with different forms are not  instantiated is a piece of fine-tuning that that anthropic explanation  leaves unexplained. The theory that all logically possible laws of physics are instantiated  as universes has a further severe problem as an explanation. As I shall  explain in Chapter 8, when considering infinite sets such as these, there  is often no objective way to ‘count’ or ‘measure’ how many of them  have one attribute rather than another. On the other hand, in    the class of all logically possible entities, those that  can understand  themselves , as the physical reality that we are in does, are surely, in  any reasonable sense, a tiny minority. The idea that one of them    ‘just happened’, without explanation, is surely just a spontaneous- generation theory. In addition, almost all the ‘universes’ described by those logically  103 Creation possible laws of physics are radically different from ours – so different  that they do not properly fit into the argument. For instance, infinitely  many of them contain nothing other than one bison, in various poses,  and last for exactly 42 seconds. Infinitely many others contain a bison  and an astrophysicist. But what  is  an astrophysicist in a universe that  contains no stars, no scientific instruments and almost no evidence?  What is a scientist, or any sort of thinking person, in a universe in  which only bad explanations are true? Almost all logically possible universes that contain astrophysicists  are governed by laws of physics that are bad explanations. So should  we predict that our universe, too, is inexplicable? Or has some high  but unknowable probability to be? Thus, again, anthropic arguments  based on ‘all possible laws’ are ruled out for being bad explanations. For these reasons I conclude that, while anthropic reasoning may  well be part of the explanation for apparent fine-tuning and other  observations, it can never be the whole explanation for why we observe  something that would otherwise look too purposeful to be explicable  as coincidence. Specific explanation, in terms of specific laws of nature,  is needed. The reader may have noticed that all the bad explanations that I have  discussed in this chapter are ultimately connected with each other. Expect too much from anthropic reasoning, or wonder too carefully  how Lamarckism could work, and you get to spontaneous generation.  Take spontaneous generation too seriously, and you get to creationism  – and so on. That is because they all address the same underlying  problem, and are all easily variable. They are easily interchangeable  with each other or with variants of themselves, and they are ‘too    easy’ as explanations: they could equally well explain anything. But  neo-Darwinism was not easy to come by, and it is not easy to tweak.  Try to tweak it – even as far as Darwin’s own misconceptions – and  you will get an explanation that doesn’t work nearly as well. Try    to account for something non-Darwinian with it – such as a new,  complex adaptation of which there were no precursors in the or  gan  - ism’s parents – and you will not be able to think of a variant with that  feature. Anthropic explanations are attempting to account for purposeful  104 the beginning of infinity structure (such as the fine-tuned constants) in terms of a single act of  selection. That is unlike evolution, and it cannot work. The solution  of the fine-tuning puzzle is going to be in terms of an explanation that  will specifically explain what we observe. It will be, as Wheeler put it,  ‘an idea so simple . . . that . . . we will all say to each other, how could  it have been otherwise?’ In other words, the problem has been not that  the world is so complex that we cannot understand why it looks as it  does, but it is that it is so  simple  that we cannot yet understand it. But  this will be noticeable only with hindsight. All those bad======================================================== conclusion from the premises, and every correctly exe  - cuted computation is a proof that the output is the outcome of the  given operations on the input. Now, a computation can also be thought of as computing a  function   that takes an arbitrary natural number as its input and delivers an  output that depends in a particular way on that input. So, for instance,  doubling a number is a function. Infinity Hotel typically tells guests  to change rooms by specifying a function and telling them all to  compute it with different inputs (their room numbers). One of    Turing’s conclusions was that almost all mathematical functions    that exist logically cannot be computed by any program. They are  ‘non-computable’ for the same reason that most logically possible  reallocations of rooms in Infinity Hotel cannot be effected by any  instruction by the management: the set of all functions is uncountably  infinite, while the set of all programs is merely countably infinite.  (That is why it is meaningful to say that ‘almost all’ members of the  infinite set of all functions have a particular property.) Hence also – as  the mathematician Kurt Gödel had discovered using a different  approach to Hilbert’s challenge – almost all mathematical  truths  have  no  proofs . They are unprovable truths. It also follows that almost all mathematical statements are  undecid- 185 A Window on Infinity able : there is no proof that they are true, and no proof that they are  false .  Each of them  is  either true or false, but there is no way of using  physical objects such as brains or computers to discover which is which.  The laws of physics provide us with only a narrow window through  which we can look out on the world of abstractions. All undecidable statements are, directly or indirectly, about infinite  sets. To the opponents of infinity in mathematics, this is due to the  meaninglessness of such statements. But to me it is a powerful argument  – like Hofstadter’s 641 argument – that abstractions exist objectively.  For it means that the truth value of an undecidable statement is certainly  not just a convenient way of describing the behaviour of some physical  object like a computer or a collection of dominoes. Interestingly, very few questions are  known  to be undecidable, even  though most are – and I shall return to that point. But there are many  unsolved mathematical conjectures, and some of those may well be  undecidable. Take, for instance, the ‘prime-pairs conjecture’. A prime  pair is a pair of prime numbers that differ by 2 – such as 5 and 7. The  conjecture is that there is no largest prime pair: there are infinitely  many of them. Suppose for the sake of argument that that is undecidable  – using  our  physics. Under many other laws of physics it is decidable.  The laws of Infinity Hotel are an example. Again, the details of how  the management would settle the prime-pairs issue are not essential to  my argument, but I present them here for the benefit of mathematically  minded readers. The management would announce: First: Please check within the next minute whether your room number  and the number two above it are both primes. Next: If they are, then send a message back through lower-numbered  rooms saying that you have found a prime pair. Use the usual method  for sending rapid messages (allow one minute for the first step and  thereafter each step must be completed in half the time of the previous  one). Store a record of this message in the lowest-numbered room that  is not already storing a record of a previous such message. Next: Check with the room numbered one more than yours. If that  guest is not storing such a record and you are, then send a message to  room 1 saying that there is a largest prime pair. 186 the beginning of infinity At the end of five minutes, the management would know the truth of  the prime-pairs conjecture. So, there is nothing  mathematically  special about the undecidable  questions, the non-computable functions, the unprovable propositions.  They are distinguished by physics only. Different physical laws would  make different things infinite, different things computable, different  truths – both mathematical and scientific – knowable. It is only the  laws of physics that determine which abstract entities and relationships  are modelled by physical objects such as mathematicians’ brains,  computers and sheets of paper. Some mathematicians wondered, at the time of Hilbert’s challenge,  whether finiteness was really an essential feature of a proof. (They  meant mathematically essential.) After all, infinity makes sense math- ematically, so why not infinite proofs? Hilbert, though he was a great  defender of Cantor’s theory, ridiculed the idea. Both he and his critics  were thereby making the same mistake as Zeno: they were all assuming  that some class of abstract entities can  prove  things, and that math- ematical reasoning could determine what that class is. But if the laws of
