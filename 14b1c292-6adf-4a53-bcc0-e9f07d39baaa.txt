======================================================== “zero mass”? The masses given here are the masses of the particles  at rest.  The fact that a particle has zero mass means, in a way, that it cannot  be  at  rest.  A photon is never at rest; it is al- ways moving at 186,000 miles a second. We will understand more what mass means when we understand the theory of relativity, which will come in due time. Thus we are confronted with a large number of particles, which together seem to be the fundamental constituents of matter. For- tunately, these particles are not  all  different in their  interactions  with one another. In fact, there seem to be just  four kinds  of interaction between particles which, in the order of decreasing strength, are the nuclear force, electrical interactions, the beta-decay interaction, and gravity. The photon is coupled to all charged particles and the strength of the interaction is measured by some number, which is 1 / 137 . The detailed law of this coupling is known, that is quantum electrodynamics. Gravity is coupled to all  energy,  but its coupling is extremely weak, much weaker than that of electricity. This law is also known. Then there are the so-called weak decays—beta decay, 43 Basic Physics 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:01 PM  Page 43 which causes the neutron to disintegrate into proton, electron, and neutrino, relatively slowly. This law is only partly known. The so- called strong interaction, the meson-baryon interaction, has a strength of 1 in this scale, and the law is completely unknown, al- though there are a number of known rules, such as that the number of baryons does not change in any reaction. This, then, is the horrible condition of our physics today. To summarize it, I would say this: outside the nucleus, we seem to know all; inside it, quantum mechanics is valid—the principles of quantum mechanics have not been found to fail. The stage on which we put all of our knowledge, we would say, is relativistic space-time; perhaps gravity is involved in space-time. We do not know how the universe got started, and we have never made exper- iments which check our ideas of space and time accurately, below some tiny distance, so we only  know  that our ideas work above that distance. We should also add that the rules of the game are the quantum-mechanical principles, and those principles apply, so far as we can tell, to the new particles as well as to the old. The origin of the forces in nuclei leads us to new particles, but unfortunately 44 Six Easy Pieces * The “strength” is a dimensionless measure of the coupling constant involved in each interaction ( means “of the order”).

We seem grad- ually to be groping toward an understanding of the world of sub- atomic particles, but we really do not know how far we have yet to go in this task. 45 Basic Physics 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:01 PM  Page 45 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:01 PM  Page 46 THE RELATION OF PHYSICS  TO OTHER SCIENCES Introduction Physics is the most fundamental and all-inclusive of the sci- ences, and has had a profound effect on all scientiﬁc develop- ment. In fact, physics is the present-day equivalent of what used to be called  natural philosophy,  from which most of our modern sci- ences arose. Students of many ﬁelds ﬁnd themselves studying physics because of the basic role it plays in all phenomena. In this chapter we shall try to explain what the fundamental problems in the other sciences are, but of course it is impossible in so small a space really to deal with the complex, subtle, beautiful matters in these other ﬁelds. Lack of space also prevents our discussing the re- lation of physics to engineering, industry, society, and war, or even the most remarkable relationship between mathematics and physics. (Mathematics is not a science from our point of view, in the sense that it is not a  natural  science. The test of its validity is not experiment.) We must, incidentally, make it clear from the be- ginning that if a thing is not a science, it is not necessarily bad. For example, love is not a science. So, if something is said not to be a science, it does not mean that there is something wrong with it; it just means that it is not a science. 47 3 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:01 PM  Page 47 Chemistry The science which is perhaps the most deeply affected by physics is chemistry. Historically, the early days of chemistry dealt almost entirely with what we now call inorganic chemistry, the chemistry of substances which are not associated with living things. Consid- erable analysis was required to discover the existence of the many elements and their relationships—how they make the various rela- tively simple compounds found in rocks,======================================================== changing, but if we could see it a billion times magniﬁed, we would see that from its own point of view it is always changing: molecules are leaving the surface, molecules are coming back. Why do  we  see  no change ? Because just as many molecules are leaving as are coming back! In the long run “nothing happens.” If we then take the top of the vessel off and blow the moist air away, replacing it with dry air, then the number of molecules leaving is just the same as it was before, because this depends on the jiggling of the water, but the number coming back is greatly reduced be- cause there are so many fewer water molecules above the water. Therefore there are more going out than coming in, and the water evaporates. Hence, if you wish to evaporate water turn on the fan! Here is something else: Which molecules leave? When a mole- cule leaves it is due to an accidental, extra accumulation of a little bit more than ordinary energy, which it needs if it is to break away from the attractions of its neighbors. Therefore, since those that leave have more energy than the average, the ones that are left have less  average motion than they had before. So the liquid gradually cools  if it evaporates. Of course, when a molecule of vapor comes from the air to the water below there is a sudden great attraction as the molecule approaches the surface. This speeds up the incoming molecule and results in generation of heat. So when they leave they take away heat; when they come back they generate heat. Of course when there is no net evaporation the result is nothing—the water is not changing temperature. If we blow on the water so as to main- tain a continuous preponderance in the number evaporating, then the water is cooled. Hence, blow on soup to cool it! Of course you should realize that the processes just described are more complicated than we have indicated. Not only does the water go into the air, but also, from time to time, one of the oxygen or nitrogen molecules will come in and “get lost” in the mass of water molecules, and work its way into the water. Thus the air dissolves in the water; oxygen and nitrogen molecules will work their way 12 Six Easy Pieces 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:00 PM  Page 12 into the water and the water will contain air. If we suddenly take the air away from the vessel, then the air molecules will leave more rapidly than they come in, and in doing so will make bubbles. This is very bad for divers, as you may know. Now we go on to another process. In Fig. 1-6 we see, from an atomic point of view, a solid dissolving in water. If we put a crystal of salt in the water, what will happen? Salt is a solid, a crystal, an organized arrangement of “salt atoms.” Figure 1-7 is an illustration of the three-dimensional structure of common salt, sodium chlo- ride. Strictly speaking, the crystal is not made of atoms, but of what we call  ions.  An ion is an atom which either has a few extra electrons or has lost a few electrons. In a salt crystal we ﬁnd chlorine ions (chlorine atoms with an extra electron) and sodium ions (sodium atoms with one electron missing). The ions all stick together by electrical attraction in the solid salt, but when we put them in the water we ﬁnd, because of the attractions of the negative oxygen and positive hydrogen for the ions, that some of the ions jiggle loose. In Fig. 1-6 we see a chlorine ion getting loose, and other atoms ﬂoating in the water in the form of ions. This picture was made with some care. Notice, for example, that the hydrogen ends of the water mol- ecules are more likely to be near the chlorine ion, while near the sodium ion we are more likely to ﬁnd the oxygen end, because the 13 Atoms in Motion Figure 1-6 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:01 PM  Page 13 sodium is positive and the oxygen end of the water is negative, and they attract electrically. Can we tell from this picture whether the salt is  dissolving in  water or  crystallizing out  of water? Of course we cannot  tell, because while some of the atoms are leaving the crystal other atoms are rejoining it. The process is a  dynamic  one, just as in the case of evaporation, and it depends on whether there is more or less salt in the water than the amount needed for equilibrium. By equilibrium we mean that situation in which the rate at which atoms are leaving just matches the rate at which they are coming back. If there is almost no salt in the water, more atoms leave than return, and the salt dissolves. If, on the other hand, there are too many “salt atoms,” more return than leave, and the salt is crystallizing. In passing, we mention that the concept of a  molecule  of a sub- stance is only approximate and exists only for a certain class of sub- stances. It is clear in the case of water that the three atoms are actually stuck together. It is not so clear in the case of sodium chlo- ride in the solid. There is just an arrangement of sodium and chlo- rine ions in a cubic pattern.======================================================== one to suffer fools gladly, he broke the rules whenever he found them arbitrary or absurd. His autobiographical writings contain amusing stories of Feynman outwitting the atom-bomb security services during the war, Feynman cracking safes, Feynman disarming women with outrageously bold behavior. He treated his Nobel Prize, awarded for his work on QED, in a similar take-it-or-leave- it manner. Alongside this distaste for formality, Feynman had a fascination with the quirky and obscure. Many will remember his obsession with the long-lost country of Tuva in Central Asia, captured so de- lightfully in a documentary ﬁlm made near the time of his death. xii Introduction 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:00 PM  Page xii His other passions included playing the bongo drums, painting, frequenting strip clubs, and deciphering Mayan texts. Feynman himself did much to cultivate his distinctive persona. Although reluctant to put pen to paper, he was voluble in conver- sation, and loved to tell stories about his ideas and escapades. These anecdotes, accumulated over the years, helped add to his mystique and made him a proverbial legend in his own lifetime. His engaging manner endeared him greatly to students, especially the younger ones, many of whom idolized him. When Feynman died of cancer in 1988 the students at Caltech, where he had worked for most of his career, unfurled a banner with the simple message: “We love you Dick.” It was Feynman’s happy-go-lucky approach to life in general and physics in particular that made him such a superb communicator. He had little time for formal lecturing or even for supervising Ph.D. students. Nevertheless he could give brilliant lectures when it suited him, deploying all the sparkling wit, penetrating insight, and irreverence that he brought to bear on his research work. In the early 1960s Feynman was persuaded to teach an introduc- tory physics course to Caltech freshmen and sophomores. He did so with characteristic panache and his inimitable blend of informality, zest, and offbeat humor. Fortunately, these priceless lectures were saved for posterity in book form. Though far removed in style and presentation from more conventional teaching texts,  The Feynman Lectures on Physics  were a huge success, and they excited and inspired a generation of students across the world. Three decades on, these vol- umes have lost nothing of their sparkle and lucidity.  Six Easy Pieces is culled directly from  The Feynman Lectur es on Physics.  It is intended to give general readers a substantive taste of Feynman the Educator by drawing on the early, nontechnical chapters from that landmark work. The result is a delightful volume—it serves both as a primer on physics for nonscientists and as a primer on Feynman himself. What is most impressive about Feynman’s carefully crafted ex- position is the way that he can develop far-reaching physical no- tions from the most slender investment in concepts, and a xiii Introduction 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:00 PM  Page xiii minimum in the way of mathematics and technical jargon. He has the knack of ﬁnding just the right analogy or everyday illustration to bring out the essence of a deep principle, without obscuring it in incidental or irrelevant details. The selection of topics contained in this volume is not intended as a comprehensive survey of modern physics, but as a tantalizing taste of the Feynman approach. We soon discover how he can illuminate even mundane topics like force and motion with new insights. Key concepts are illustrated by examples drawn from daily life or antiq- uity. Physics is continually linked to other sciences while leaving the reader in no doubt about which is the fundamental discipline. Right at the beginning of  Six Easy Pieces  we learn how all physics is rooted in the notion of law—the existence of an ordered universe that can be understood by the application of rational reasoning. However, the laws of physics are not transparent to us in our direct observations of nature. They are frustratingly hidden, subtly en- coded in the phenomena we study. The arcane procedures of the physicist—a mixture of carefully designed experimentation and mathematical theorizing—are needed to unveil the underlying law- like reality. Possibly the best-known law of physics is Newton’s inverse square law of gravitation, discussed here in Chapter Five. The topic is introduced in the context of the solar system and Kepler’s laws of planetary motion. But gravitation is universal, applying across the cosmos, enabling Feynman to spice his account with examples from astronomy and cosmology. Commenting on a picture of a globular cluster somehow held together by unseen forces, he waxes lyrical: “If one cannot see gravitation acting here, he has no soul.” Other laws are known that refer to the various nongravitational forces of nature that describe how particles of matter interact with each other. There is but a handful of these forces, and======================================================== and pull it out and let go, then the pendulum will swing almost in a plane, but not quite. Slowly the plane keeps changing in Stockholm, but not in Quito. The blinds are down, 35 Basic Physics 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:01 PM  Page 35 too. The fact that this happened does not bring on the destruction of science. What  is  the fundamental hypothesis of science, the fundamental philosophy? We stated it in the ﬁrst chapter:  the sole test of the validity of any idea is experiment.  If it turns out that most experiments work out the same in Quito as they do in Stockholm, then those “most experiments” will be used to formulate some general law, and those experiments which do not come out the same we will say were a result of the environment near Stockholm. We will invent some way to summarize the results of the experi- ment, and we do not have to be told ahead of time what this way will look like. If we are told that the same experiment will always produce the same result, that is all very well, but if when we try it, it does  not,  then it does  not.  We just have to take what we see, and then formulate all the rest of our ideas in terms of our actual experience. Returning again to quantum mechanics and fundamental physics, we cannot go into details of the quantum-mechanical principles at this time, of course, because these are rather difficult to understand. We shall assume that they are there, and go on to describe what some of the consequences are. One of the conse- quences is that things which we used to consider as waves also behave like particles, and particles behave like waves; in fact everything behaves the same way. There is no distinction between a wave and a particle. So quantum mechanics  uniﬁes  the idea of the ﬁeld and its waves, and the particles, all into one. Now it is true that when the frequency is low, the ﬁeld aspect of the phe- nomenon is more evident, or more useful as an approximate de- scription in terms of everyday experiences. But as the frequency increases, the particle aspects of the phenomenon become more evident with the equipment with which we usually make the mea- surements. In fact, although we mentioned many frequencies, no phenomenon directly involving a frequency has yet been detected above approximately 10 12 cycles per second. We only  deduce  the higher frequencies from the energy of the particles, by a rule 36 Six Easy Pieces 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:01 PM  Page 36 which assumes that the particle-wave idea of quantum mechanics is valid. Thus we have a new view of electromagnetic interaction. We have a new kind of  particle  to add to the electron, the proton, and the neutron. That new particle is called a  photon.  The new view of the interaction of electrons and photons that is electromagnetic theory, but with everything quantum-mechanically correct, is called quantum electrodynamics.  This fundamental theory of the interac- tion of light and matter, or electric ﬁeld and charges, is our greatest success so far in physics. In this one theory we have the basic rules for all ordinary phenomena except for gravitation and nuclear pro- cesses. For example, out of quantum electrodynamics come all known electrical, mechanical, and chemical laws: the laws for the collision of billiard balls, the motions of wires in magnetic ﬁelds, the speciﬁc heat of carbon monoxide, the color of neon signs, the density of salt, and the reactions of hydrogen and oxygen to make water are all consequences of this one law. All these details can be worked out if the situation is simple enough for us to make an ap- proximation, which is almost never, but often we can understand more or less what is happening. At the present time no exceptions are found to the quantum-electrodynamic laws outside the nucleus, and there we do not know whether there is an exception because we simply do not know what is going on in the nucleus. In principle, then, quantum electrodynamics is the theory of all chemistry, and of life, if life is ultimately reduced to chemistry and therefore just to physics because chemistry is already reduced (the part of physics which is involved in chemistry being already known). Furthermore, the same quantum electrodynamics, this great thing, predicts a lot of new things. In the ﬁrst place, it tells the properties of very high-energy photons, gamma rays, etc. It predicted another very remarkable thing: besides the electron, there should be another particle of the same mass, but of opposite charge, called a  positron,  and these two, coming together, could annihilate each other with the emission of light or gamma rays. 37 Basic Physics 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:01 PM  Page 37 (After all, light and gamma rays are all the same; they are just dif- ferent points on a frequency scale.) The generalization of this, that for each particle there is an antiparticle, turns out to be true. In the case of electrons, the antiparticle has another name—it is======================================================== Six Easy Pieces 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:01 PM  Page 112 years we have discovered that all mass is made of tiny particles and that there are several kinds of interactions, such as nuclear forces, etc. None of these nuclear or electrical forces has yet been found to explain gravitation. The quantum-mechanical aspects of nature have not yet been carried over to gravitation. When the scale is so small that we need the quantum effects, the gravitational effects are so weak that the need for a quantum theory of gravitation has not yet developed. On the other hand, for consistency in our physical theories it would be important to see whether Newton’s law mod- iﬁed to Einstein’s law can be further modiﬁed to be consistent with the uncertainty principle. This last modiﬁcation has not yet been completed. 113 The Theory of Gravitation 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:01 PM  Page 113 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:01 PM  Page 114 QUANTUM BEHAVIOR Atomic mechanics In the last few chapters we have treated the essential ideas nec- essary for an understanding of most of the important phenom- ena of light—or electromagnetic radiation in general. (We have left a few special topics for next year. Speciﬁcally, the theory of the index of dense materials and total internal reﬂection.) What we have dealt with is called the “classical theory” of electric waves, which turns out to be a completely adequate description of nature for a large number of effects. We have not had to worry yet about the fact that light energy comes in lumps or “photons.” We would like to take up as our next subject the problem of the behavior of relatively large pieces of matter—their mechanical and thermal properties, for instance. In discussing these, we will ﬁnd that the “classical” (or older) theory fails almost immediately, be- cause matter is really made up of atomic-sized particles. Still, we will deal only with the classical part, because that is the only part that we can understand using the classical mechanics we have been learning. But we shall not be very successful. We shall ﬁnd that in the case of matter, unlike the case of light, we shall be in difficulty relatively soon. We could, of course, continuously skirt away from the atomic effects, but we shall instead interpose here a short ex- cursion in which we will describe the basic ideas of the quantum properties of matter, i.e., the quantum ideas of atomic physics, so 115 6 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:01 PM  Page 115 that you will have some feeling for what it is we are leaving out. For we will have to leave out some important subjects that we can- not avoid coming close to. So we will give now the  introduction  to the subject of quantum mechanics, but will not be able actually to get into the subject until much later. “Quantum mechanics” is the description of the behavior of mat- ter in all its details and, in particular, of the happenings on an atomic scale. Things on a very small scale behave like nothing that you have any direct experience about. They do not behave like waves, they do not behave like particles, they do not behave like clouds, or billiard balls, or weights on springs, or like anything that you have ever seen. Newton thought that light was made up of particles, but then it was discovered, as we have seen here, that it behaves like a wave. Later, however (in the beginning of the twentieth century), it was found that light did indeed sometimes behave like a particle. His- torically, the electron, for example, was thought to behave like a particle, and then it was found that in many respects it behaved like a wave. So it really behaves like neither. Now we have given up. We say: “It is like  neither .” There is one lucky break, however—electrons behave just like light. The quantum behavior of atomic objects (electrons, pro- tons, neutrons, photons, and so on) is the same for all; they are all “particle waves,” or whatever you want to call them. So what we learn about the properties of electrons (which we shall use for our examples) will apply also to all “particles,” including photons of light. The gradual accumulation of information about atomic and small-scale behavior during the ﬁrst quarter of this century, which gave some indications about how small things do behave, produced an increasing confusion which was ﬁnally resolved in 1926 and 1927 by Schrödinger, Heisenberg, and Born. They ﬁnally obtained a consistent description of the behavior of matter on a small scale. We take up the main features of that description in this chapter. 116 Six Easy Pieces 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:01 PM  Page 116 Because atomic behavior is so unlike ordinary experience, it is very difficult to get used to and it appears peculiar and mysterious to everyone, both to the novice and to the experienced physicist. Even the experts do not understand it the way they would like to, and it is perfectly reasonable that they should not, because======================================================== down in 12 hours. Another school of thought claimed that the high tide should be on the other side of the earth because, so they ar- gued, the moon pulls the earth away from the water! Both of these theories are wrong. It actually works like this: The pull of the moon for the earth and for the water is “balanced” at the center. But the water which is closer to the moon is pulled  more  than the average and the water which is farther away from it is pulled  less  than the average. Furthermore, the water can ﬂow while the more rigid earth cannot. The true picture is a combination of these two things. What do we mean by “balanced”? What balances? If the moon pulls the whole earth toward it, why doesn’t the earth fall right “up” to the moon? Because the earth does the same trick as the moon: it goes in a circle around a point which is inside the earth but not at its center. The moon does not just go around the earth, the earth and the moon both go around a central position, each falling to- ward this common position, as shown in Fig. 5-5. This motion around the common center is what balances the fall of each. So the earth is not going in a straight line either; it travels in a circle. The water on the far side is “unbalanced” because the moon’s attraction there is weaker than it is at the center of the earth, where it just balances the “centrifugal force.” The result of this imbalance is that the water rises up, away from the center of the earth. On the near side, the attraction from the moon is stronger, and the imbalance is in the opposite direction in space, but again  away  from the center of the earth. The net result is that we get  two  tidal bulges. Universal gravitation What else can we understand when we understand gravity? Everyone knows the earth is round. Why is the earth round? That is easy; it is due to gravitation. The earth can be understood to be round merely because everything attracts everything else and so it has attracted it- 98 Six Easy Pieces 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:01 PM  Page 98 self together as far as it can! If we go even further, the earth is not exactly  a sphere because it is rotating, and this brings in centrifugal effects which tend to oppose gravity near the equator. It turns out that the earth should be elliptical, and we even get the right shape for the ellipse. We can thus deduce that the sun, the moon, and the earth should be (nearly) spheres, just from the law of gravitation. What else can you do with the law of gravitation? If we look at the moons of Jupiter we can understand everything about the way they move around that planet. Incidentally, there was once a certain difficulty with the moons of Jupiter that is worth remarking on. These satellites were studied very carefully by Roemer, who noticed that the moons sometimes seemed to be ahead of schedule, and sometimes behind. (One can ﬁnd their schedules by waiting a very long time and ﬁnding out how long it takes on the average for the moons to go around.) Now they were  ahead  when Jupiter was par- ticularly  close  to the earth and they were  behind  when Jupiter was farther  from the earth. This would have been a very difficult thing to explain according to the law of gravitation—it would have been, in fact, the death of this wonderful theory if there were no other ex- planation. If a law does not work even in  one place  where it ought to, it is just wrong. But the reason for this discrepancy was very simple and beautiful: it takes a little while to  see  the moons of Jupiter because of the time it takes light to travel from Jupiter to the earth. 99 The Theory of Gravitation Figure 5-5 The earth-moon system, with tides. 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:01 PM  Page 99 When Jupiter is closer to the earth the time is a little less, and when it is farther from the earth, the time is more. This is why moons ap- pear to be, on the average, a little ahead or a little behind, depending on whether they are closer to or farther from the earth. This phe- nomenon showed that light does not travel instantaneously, and fur- nished the ﬁrst estimate of the speed of light. This was done in 1656. If all of the planets push and pull on each other, the force which controls, let us say, Jupiter in going around the sun is not just the force from the sun; there is also a pull from, say, Saturn. This force is not really strong, since the sun is much more massive than Saturn, but there is  some  pull, so the orbit of Jupiter should not be a perfect ellipse, and it is not; it is slightly off, and “wobbles” around the cor- rect elliptical orbit. Such a motion is a little more complicated. At- tempts were made to analyze the motions of Jupiter, Saturn, and Uranus on the basis of the law of gravitation. The effects of each of these planets on each other were calculated to see whether or not the tiny deviations and irregularities in these motions could be com- pletely understood from this one law.

( Why  does it keep on coasting? We do not know, but that is the way it is.) Newton modiﬁed this idea, saying that the only way to change the motion of a body is to use  force.  If the body speeds up, a force has been applied  in the direction of motion.  On the other hand, if its motion is changed to a new  direction,  a force has been applied sideways.  Newton thus added the idea that a force is needed to change the speed  or the direction  of motion of a body. For example, if a stone is attached to a string and is whirling around in a circle, it takes a force to keep it in the circle. We have to  pull  on the string. In fact, the law is that the acceleration produced by the force is inversely proportional to the mass, or the force is propor- tional to the mass times the acceleration. The more massive a thing is, the stronger the force required to produce a given acceleration. (The mass can be measured by putting other stones on the end of the same string and making them go around the same circle at the same speed. In this way it is found that more or less force is re- quired, the more massive object requiring more force.) The bril- liant idea resulting from these considerations is that no  tangential force is needed to keep a planet in its orbit (the angels do not have to ﬂy tangentially) because the planet would coast in that direction anyway. If there were nothing at all to disturb it, the planet would go off in a  straight line.  But the actual motion deviates from the line on which the body would have gone if there were no force, the deviation being essentially  at right angles  to the motion, not in the direction of the motion. In other words, because of the prin- ciple of inertia, the force needed to control the motion of a planet around the sun is not a force  around  the sun but  toward  the sun. (If there is a force toward the sun, the sun might be the angel, of course!) 93 The Theory of Gravitation 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:01 PM  Page 93 Newton’s law of gravitation From his better understanding of the theory of motion, Newton appreciated that  the sun  could be the seat or organization of forces that govern the motion of the planets. Newton proved to himself (and perhaps we shall be able to prove it soon) that the very fact that equal areas are swept out in equal times is a precise signpost of the proposition that all deviations are precisely  radial —that the law of areas is a direct consequence of the idea that all of the forces are directed exactly  toward the sun. Next, by analyzing Kepler’s third law it is possible to show that the farther away the planet, the weaker the forces. If two planets at different distances from the sun are compared, the analysis shows that the forces are inversely proportional to the squares of the re- spective distances. With the combination of the two laws, Newton concluded that there must be a force, inversely as the square of the distance, directed in a line between the two objects. Being a man of considerable feeling for generalities, Newton supposed, of course, that this relationship applied more generally than just to the sun holding the planets. It was already known, for example, that the planet Jupiter had moons going around it as the moon of the earth goes around the earth, and Newton felt certain that each planet held its moons with a force. He already knew of the force holding  us  on the earth, so he proposed that this was a universal  force— that everything pulls everything else. The next problem was whether the pull of the earth on its people was the “same” as its pull on the moon, i.e., inversely as the square of the distance. If an object on the surface of the earth falls 16 feet in the ﬁrst second after it is released from rest, how far does the moon fall in the same time? We might say that the moon does not fall at all. But if there were no force on the moon, it would go off in a straight line, whereas it goes in a circle instead, so it really  falls in  from where it would have been if there were no force at all. We can calculate from the radius of the moon’s orbit (which is about 240,000 miles) and how long it takes to go around the earth (ap- 94 Six Easy Pieces 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:01 PM  Page 94 proximately 29 days) how far the moon moves in its orbit in one second, and can then calculate how far it falls in one second.* This distance turns out to be roughly  1 / 20 of an inch in a second. That ﬁts very well with the inverse square law, because the earth’s radius is 4000 miles, and if something which is 4000 miles from the center of the earth falls 16 feet in a second, something 240,000 miles, or 60 times as far away, should fall only  1 / 3600 of 16 feet, which also is roughly  1 / 20 of an inch. Wishing to put this theory of gravitation to a test by similar calculations, Newton======================================================== delicate that it does not disturb the pattern in an essential way. No one has ever found (or even thought of) a way around the uncertainty principle. So we must assume that it describes a basic characteristic of nature. The complete theory of quantum mechanics which we now use to describe atoms and, in fact, all matter depends on the correctness of the uncertainty principle. Since quantum mechanics is such a successful theory, our belief in the uncertainty principle is rein- forced. But if a way to “beat” the uncertainty principle were ever discovered, quantum mechanics would give inconsistent results and would have to be discarded as a valid theory of nature. “Well,” you say, “what about Proposition A? It is true, or is it not  true, that the electron either goes through hole 1 or it goes through hole 2?” The only answer that can be given is that we have found from experiment that there is a certain special way that we have to think in order that we do not get into inconsistencies. What we must say (to avoid making wrong predictions) is the following: If one looks at the holes or, more accurately, if one has a piece of apparatus which is capable of determining whether the electrons go through hole 1 or hole 2, then one  can  say that it goes either through hole 1 or hole 2.  But,  when one does  not  try to tell which way the electron goes, when there is nothing in the experiment to disturb the electrons, then one may  not  say that an electron goes either through hole 1 or hole 2. If one does say that, and starts to make any deductions from the statement, he will make errors in the analysis. This is the logical tightrope on which we must walk if we wish to describe nature successfully. If the motion of all matter—as well as electrons—must be de- scribed in terms of waves, what about the bullets in our ﬁrst exper- iment? Why didn’t we see an interference pattern there? It turns 132 Six Easy Pieces 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:01 PM  Page 132 out that for the bullets the wavelengths were so tiny that the inter- ference patterns became very ﬁne. So ﬁne, in fact, that with any detector of ﬁnite size one could not distinguish the separate maxima and minima. What we saw was only a kind of average, which is the classical curve. In Fig. 6-5 we have tried to indicate schematically what happens with large-scale objects. Part (a) of the ﬁgure shows the probability distribution one might predict for bullets, using quantum mechanics. The rapid wiggles are supposed to represent the interference pattern one gets for waves of very short wavelength. Any physical detector, however, straddles several wiggles of the 133 Quantum Behavior probability curve, so that the measurements show the smooth curve drawn in part (b) of the ﬁgure. First principles of quantum mechanics We will now write a summary of the main conclusions of our ex- periments. We will, however, put the results in a form which makes them true for a general class of such experiments. We can write our Figure 6-5 Interference pattern with bullets: (a) actual (schematic),  (b) observed.  0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:01 PM  Page 133 summary more simply if we ﬁrst deﬁne an “ideal experiment” as one in which there are no uncertain external inﬂuences, i.e., no jig- gling or other things going on that we cannot take into account. We would be quite precise if we said: “An ideal experiment is one in which all of the initial and ﬁnal conditions of the experiment are completely speciﬁed.” What we will call “an event” is, in general, just a speciﬁc set of initial and ﬁnal conditions. (For example: “An electron leaves the gun, arrives at the detector, and nothing else happens.”) Now for our summary. Summary (1) The probability of an event in an ideal experiment is given by the square of the absolute value of a complex number  f which is called the probability amplitude. P = probability, f = probability amplitude, (6.6) P = | f | 2 . (2) When an event can occur in several alternative ways, the probability amplitude for the event is the sum of the proba- bility amplitudes for each way considered separately. There is interference. f =  f 1 +  f 2 , P = | f 1 +  f 2 | 2 . (6.7) (3) If an experiment is performed which is capable of determin- ing whether one or another alternative is actually taken, the probability of the event is the sum of the probabilities for each alternative. The interference is lost. P = P 1 + P 2 . (6.8) 134 Six Easy Pieces 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:01 PM  Page 134 One might still like to ask: “How does it work? What is the ma- chinery behind the law?” No one has found any machinery behind the law. No one can “explain” any more than we have just “ex- plained.” No one will give you any deeper representation of the sit- uation. We have no ideas about a more basic mechanism from which these results can be deduced. We would like to emphasize a very important difference between classical and quantum mechanics.  We have been======================================================== talking about the probability that an electron will arrive in a given circumstance. We have implied that in our experimental arrangement (or even in the best possible one) it would be impossible to predict exactly what would happen. We can only predict the odds! This would mean, if it were true, that physics has given up on the problem of trying to predict exactly what will happen in a deﬁnite circumstance. Yes! Physics  has  given up.  We do not know how to predict what would happen in a given circumstance,  and we believe now that it is im- possible, that the only thing that can be predicted is the probability of different events. It must be recognized that this is a retrenchment in our earlier ideal of understanding nature. It may be a backward step, but no one has seen a way to avoid it. We make now a few remarks on a suggestion that has sometimes been made to try to avoid the description we have given: “Perhaps the electron has some kind of internal works—some inner variables— that we do not yet know about. Perhaps that is why we cannot predict what will happen. If we could look more closely at the electron we would be able to tell where it would end up.” So far as we know, that is impossible. We would still be in difficulty. Suppose we were to as- sume that inside the electron there is some kind of machinery that determines where it is going to end up. That machine must  also  de- termine which hole it is going to go through on its way. But we must not forget that what is inside the electron should not be dependent on what  we  do, and in particular upon whether we open or close one of the holes. So if an electron, before it starts, has already made up its mind (a) which hole it is going to use, and (b) where it is going 135 Quantum Behavior 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:01 PM  Page 135 to land, we should ﬁnd  P 1 for those electrons that have chosen hole 1,  P 2 for those that have chosen hole 2,  and necessarily  the sum  P 1 + P 2 for those that arrive through the  two holes. There  seems to be no way around this. But we have veriﬁed experimentally that that is not the case. And no one has ﬁgured a way out of this puzzle. So at the present time we must limit ourselves to computing probabilities. We say “at the present time,” but we suspect very strongly that it is some- thing that will be with us forever—that it is impossible to beat that puzzle—that this is the way nature really  is . The uncertainty principle This is the way Heisenberg stated the uncertainty principle origi- nally: If you make the measurement on any object, and you can determine the  x -component of its momentum with an uncertainty D p , you cannot, at the same time, know its  x -position more accu- rately than  . The uncertainties in the position and mo- mentum at any instant must have their product greater than half the reduced Planck constant. This is a special case of the uncer- tainty principle that was stated above more generally. The more general statement was that one cannot design equipment in any way to determine which of two alternatives is taken, without, at the same time, destroying the pattern of interference. Let us show for one particular case that the kind of relation given by Heisenberg must be true in order to keep from getting into trou- ble. We imagine a modiﬁcation of the experiment of Fig. 6-3, in which the wall with the holes consists of a plate mounted on rollers so that it can move freely up and down (in the  x -direction), as shown in Fig. 6-6. By watching the motion of the plate carefully we can try to tell which hole an electron goes through. Imagine what happens when the detector is placed at  x = 0. We would expect that an electron which passes through hole 1 must be deﬂected downward by the plate to reach the detector. Since the vertical com- ponent of the electron momentum is changed, the plate must recoil with an equal momentum in the opposite direction. The plate will / xp 2 ' $ DD 136 Six Easy Pieces 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:01 PM  Page 136 get an upward kick. If the electron goes through the lower hole, the plate should feel a downward kick. It is clear that for every po- sition of the detector, the momentum received by the plate will have a different value for a traversal via hole 1 than for a traversal via hole 2. So! Without disturbing the electrons  at all,  but just by watching the  plate,  we can tell which path the electron used. Now in order to do this it is necessary to know what the mo- mentum of the screen is, before the electron goes through. So when we measure the momentum after the electron goes by, we can ﬁgure out how much the plate’s momentum has changed. But remember, according to the uncertainty principle we cannot at the same time know the position of the plate with an arbitrary accuracy. But if we do not know exactly  where  the plate is we cannot say precisely where the two holes are. They will be in a different place for every electron that goes======================================================== changing, but if we could see it a billion times magniﬁed, we would see that from its own point of view it is always changing: molecules are leaving the surface, molecules are coming back. Why do  we  see  no change ? Because just as many molecules are leaving as are coming back! In the long run “nothing happens.” If we then take the top of the vessel off and blow the moist air away, replacing it with dry air, then the number of molecules leaving is just the same as it was before, because this depends on the jiggling of the water, but the number coming back is greatly reduced be- cause there are so many fewer water molecules above the water. Therefore there are more going out than coming in, and the water evaporates. Hence, if you wish to evaporate water turn on the fan! Here is something else: Which molecules leave? When a mole- cule leaves it is due to an accidental, extra accumulation of a little bit more than ordinary energy, which it needs if it is to break away from the attractions of its neighbors. Therefore, since those that leave have more energy than the average, the ones that are left have less  average motion than they had before. So the liquid gradually cools  if it evaporates. Of course, when a molecule of vapor comes from the air to the water below there is a sudden great attraction as the molecule approaches the surface. This speeds up the incoming molecule and results in generation of heat. So when they leave they take away heat; when they come back they generate heat. Of course when there is no net evaporation the result is nothing—the water is not changing temperature. If we blow on the water so as to main- tain a continuous preponderance in the number evaporating, then the water is cooled. Hence, blow on soup to cool it! Of course you should realize that the processes just described are more complicated than we have indicated. Not only does the water go into the air, but also, from time to time, one of the oxygen or nitrogen molecules will come in and “get lost” in the mass of water molecules, and work its way into the water. Thus the air dissolves in the water; oxygen and nitrogen molecules will work their way 12 Six Easy Pieces 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:00 PM  Page 12 into the water and the water will contain air. If we suddenly take the air away from the vessel, then the air molecules will leave more rapidly than they come in, and in doing so will make bubbles. This is very bad for divers, as you may know. Now we go on to another process. In Fig. 1-6 we see, from an atomic point of view, a solid dissolving in water. If we put a crystal of salt in the water, what will happen? Salt is a solid, a crystal, an organized arrangement of “salt atoms.” Figure 1-7 is an illustration of the three-dimensional structure of common salt, sodium chlo- ride. Strictly speaking, the crystal is not made of atoms, but of what we call  ions.  An ion is an atom which either has a few extra electrons or has lost a few electrons. In a salt crystal we ﬁnd chlorine ions (chlorine atoms with an extra electron) and sodium ions (sodium atoms with one electron missing). The ions all stick together by electrical attraction in the solid salt, but when we put them in the water we ﬁnd, because of the attractions of the negative oxygen and positive hydrogen for the ions, that some of the ions jiggle loose. In Fig. 1-6 we see a chlorine ion getting loose, and other atoms ﬂoating in the water in the form of ions. This picture was made with some care. Notice, for example, that the hydrogen ends of the water mol- ecules are more likely to be near the chlorine ion, while near the sodium ion we are more likely to ﬁnd the oxygen end, because the 13 Atoms in Motion Figure 1-6 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:01 PM  Page 13 sodium is positive and the oxygen end of the water is negative, and they attract electrically. Can we tell from this picture whether the salt is  dissolving in  water or  crystallizing out  of water? Of course we cannot  tell, because while some of the atoms are leaving the crystal other atoms are rejoining it. The process is a  dynamic  one, just as in the case of evaporation, and it depends on whether there is more or less salt in the water than the amount needed for equilibrium. By equilibrium we mean that situation in which the rate at which atoms are leaving just matches the rate at which they are coming back. If there is almost no salt in the water, more atoms leave than return, and the salt dissolves. If, on the other hand, there are too many “salt atoms,” more return than leave, and the salt is crystallizing. In passing, we mention that the concept of a  molecule  of a sub- stance is only approximate and exists only for a certain class of sub- stances. It is clear in the case of water that the three atoms are actually stuck together. It is not so clear in the case of sodium chlo- ride in the solid. There is just an arrangement of sodium and chlo- rine ions in a cubic pattern.======================================================== 30, 38, 40 Psychology, physics and, 63–  64 Quantum behavior atomic mechanics, 115–  17 bullets, experiment with, 117– 19 electron waves, interference of, 124–  27 electrons, experiment with, 122– 24,  127– 33 waves, experiment with, 120– 22 Quantum chemistry, 49 Quantum electrodynamics (QED), x, 37–  38, 43–  44 Quantum mechanics of chemistry, 26, 48 deﬁned, 116 ﬁrst principles of, 133–  36 144 Index 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:01 PM  Page 144 gravitation and, 113 properties of, 33–  38 uncertainty principle, 136–  38 Radar waves, 32 Radiant energy, 71, 83 Radio waves, 31 Radius vector, 91 Reason, scientiﬁc method and, 24 Relativity gravity and, 112–  13 theory of, 43 Reproduction, 57–  59 Repulsion, electrical force and, 28 Resonances, 40, 42 Respiratory cycle, 52 Reversible machines, 73–  76 Ribosomes, 58, 59 RNA, 58–  59 “Rules of the game,” 24–  25 S number, particles, 40 Salt, dissolving in water, 13–  15 Sands, Prof. Matthew, xxviii Schwinger, Julian, xxii Scientiﬁc method, 24 Screw jack, 78 Sensation, physiology of, 64 Short-range interaction force, 28 Sigma baryons, 41, 42 Sodium chloride, 13 Solids atomic hypothesis, 9 dissolving in water, 13–  15 Solution, precipitation and, 14 Sound, waves of excess density and, 28 Space, conservation of momentum, 84, 85 Space, time and, 27, 33, 44 Stars, 59–  61, 65–  66, 101–  4 Statistical mechanics, 48–  49, 60 Steam, atomic hypothesis, 6–  8 Steam engines, 71 Stevinus, 78 “Strangeness” number, particles, 40, 42 Strong particle interactions, 43– 44 Substances, properties of, 26 Sun, planetary motion and, 90– 92 Symmetry, atoms in ice, 9 Technetium, 60 Temperature, 8–  10 geology and, 62–  63 Thermodynamics, 49, 85 Thermonuclear reactions, 86 Thymine, 57 Tides, pull of the moon and, 97– 98,  99f Time, conservation of energy and, 84, 85 Time, space and, 27, 33 TNT explosion, 38 Tomanaga, Sin-Itero, xxii Torsion ﬁber, 105 Total internal reﬂection, 115 Transpiration, 17 Turbulent ﬂow, 62 Turbulent ﬂuids, 66 Ultraviolet frequencies, 32 Unbalanced electrical force, 29 145 Index 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:01 PM  Page 145 Universal gravitation, 98–  104 Universe, age of, 110–  11 Velocity, kinetic energy and, 81 Vertical motions, 95, 96f Virtual work, principle of, 79 Volcanism, 62–  63 Water atomic hypothesis, 4–  10 dissolving solids in, 13–  15 evaporation, 11–  13 Water vapor, 11–  13, 17 Waves behavior of, 32–  33, 36 electromagnetic, 31–  33 excess density, sound and, 28 quantum behavior experiment with, 120–  22 Weak decay particle interactions, 43– 44 Weather, 61–  62, 66 Weight-lifting machines, 72–  76 Work, virtual, 79 X-rays, 26, 32–  33 Yukawa, 38–39 Zero-charge particles, 40 Zero mass, 43 Zero-mass particles, 40 146 Index 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:01 PM  Page 146======================================================== was in the lectures—by putting in suggestions of applications of the ideas and concepts in various directions outside the main line of attack. For this reason, though, I tried very hard to make all the statements as accurate as possible, to point out in every case where the equations and ideas ﬁtted into the body of physics, and how—when they learned more—things would be modiﬁed. I also felt that for such students it is important to indicate what it is that they should—if they are sufficiently clever—be able to understand by deduction from what has been said before, and what is being put in as something new. When new ideas came in, I would try either to deduce them if they were deducible, or to explain that it was  a new idea which hadn’t any basis in terms of things they had already learned and which was not supposed to be provable—but was just added in. At the start of these lectures, I assumed that the students knew something when they came out of high school—such things as geometrical optics, simple chemistry ideas, and so on. I also didn’t see that there was any reason to make the lectures in a deﬁnite order, in the sense that I would not be allowed to mention some- thing until I was ready to discuss it in detail. There was a great deal of mention of things to come, without complete discussions. These more complete discussions would come later when the preparation became more advanced. Examples are the discussions of induc- tance, and of energy levels, which are at ﬁrst brought in in a very qualitative way and are later developed more completely. At the same time that I was aiming at the more active student, I also wanted to take care of the fellow for whom the extra ﬁreworks and side applications are merely disquieting and who cannot be ex- pected to learn most of the material in the lecture at all. For such students, I wanted there to be at least a central core or backbone of material which he  could  get. Even if he didn’t understand everything in a lecture, I hoped he wouldn’t get nervous. I didn’t expect him to understand everything, but only the central and most direct fea- xxvi Feynman’s Preface 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:00 PM  Page xxvi tures. It takes, of course, a certain intelligence on his part to see which are the central theorems and central ideas, and which are the more advanced side issues and applications which he may under- stand only in later years. In giving these lectures there was one serious difficulty: in the way the course was given, there wasn’t any feedback from the students to the lecturer to indicate how well the lectures were going over. This is indeed a very serious difficulty, and I don’t know how good the lec- tures really are. The whole thing was essentially an experiment. And if I did it again I wouldn’t do it the same way—I hope I  don’t  have to do it again! I think, though, that things worked out—so far as the physics is concerned—quite satisfactorily in the ﬁrst year. In the second year I was not so satisﬁed. In the ﬁrst part of the course, dealing with electricity and magnetism, I couldn’t think of any really unique or different way of doing it—of any way that would be particularly more exciting than the usual way of present- ing it. So I don’t think I did very much in the lectures on electricity and magnetism. At the end of the second year I had originally in- tended to go on, after the electricity and magnetism, by giving some more lectures on the properties of materials, but mainly to take up things like fundamental modes, solutions of the diffusion equation, vibrating systems, orthogonal functions, . . . developing the ﬁrst stages of what are  usually called “the mathematical methods of physics.” In retrospect, I think that if I were doing it again I would go back to that original idea. But since it was not planned that I would be giving these lectures again, it was suggested that it might be a good idea to try to give an introduction to the quantum mechanics—what you will ﬁnd in Volume III. It is perfectly clear that students who will major in physics can wait until their third year for quantum mechanics. On the other hand, the argument was made that many of the students in our course study physics as a background for their primary interest in other ﬁelds. And the usual way of dealing with quantum mechan- ics makes that subject almost unavailable for the great majority of xxvii Feynman’s Preface 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:00 PM  Page xxvii students because they have to take so long to learn it. Yet, in its real applications—especially in its more complex applications, such as in electrical engineering and chemistry—the full machinery of the differential equation approach is not actually used. So I tried to de- scribe the principles of quantum mechanics in a way which wouldn’t require that one ﬁrst know the mathematics of partial dif- ferential equations. Even for a physicist I think that is an interesting thing to try to do—to
