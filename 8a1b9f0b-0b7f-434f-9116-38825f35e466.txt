======================================================== Of course, if we watch long enough, we may eventually catch on to a few of the rules.  The rules of the game  are what we mean by  fundamental physics.  Even if we knew every rule, however, we might not be able to understand why a particular move is made in the game, merely because it is too complicated and our minds are limited. If you play chess you must know that it is easy to learn all the rules, and yet it is often very hard to select the best move or to understand why a player moves as he does. So it is in nature, only much more so; but we may be able at least to ﬁnd all the rules. Actually, we do not have all the rules now. (Every once in a while something like castling is going on that we still do not understand.) Aside from not knowing all of the rules, what we really can explain in terms of those rules is very limited, because almost all situations are so enormously complicated that we cannot follow the plays of the game using the rules, much less tell what is going to happen next. We must, therefore, limit ourselves to the more basic question 24 Six Easy Pieces 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:01 PM  Page 24 of the rules of the game. If we know the rules, we consider that we “understand” the world. How can we tell whether the rules which we “guess” at are really right if we cannot analyze the game very well? There are, roughly speaking, three ways. First, there may be situations where nature has arranged, or we arrange nature, to be simple and to have so few parts that we can predict exactly what will happen, and thus we can check how our rules work. (In one corner of the board there may be only a few chess pieces at work, and that we can ﬁg- ure out exactly.) A second good way to check rules is in terms of less speciﬁc rules derived from them. For example, the rule on the move of a bishop on a chessboard is that it moves only on the diagonal. One can de- duce, no matter how many moves may be made, that a certain bishop will always be on a red square. So, without being able to follow the details, we can always check our idea about the bishop’s motion by ﬁnding out whether it is always on a red square. Of course it will be, for a long time, until all of a sudden we ﬁnd that it is on a  black  square (what happened, of course, is that in the meantime it was captured, another pawn crossed for queening, and it turned into a bishop on a black square). That is the way it is in physics. For a long time we will have a rule that works excellently in an overall way, even when we cannot follow the details, and then sometime we may discover a  new rule.  From the point of view of basic physics, the most interesting phenomena are of course in the new  places, the places where the rules do not work—not the places where they  do  work! That is the way in which we discover new rules. The third way to tell whether our ideas are right is relatively crude but probably the most powerful of them all. That is, by rough approximation.  While we may not be able to tell why Alekhine moves  this particular piece,  perhaps we can  roughly  understand that he is gathering his pieces around the king to protect it, more or less, since that is the sensible thing to do in the circumstances. In the same way, we can often understand nature, more or less, without 25 Basic Physics 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:01 PM  Page 25 being able to see what  every little piece  is doing, in terms of our un- derstanding of the game. At ﬁrst the phenomena of nature were roughly divided into classes, like heat, electricity, mechanics, magnetism, properties of substances, chemical phenomena, light or optics, x-rays, nuclear physics, gravitation, meson phenomena, etc. However, the aim is to see  complete nature  as different aspects of  one set  of phenomena. That is the problem in basic theoretical physics today—to  ﬁnd the laws behind experiment;  to  amalgamate these classes.  Historically, we have always been able to amalgamate them, but as time goes on new things are found. We were amalgamating very well, when all of a sudden x-rays were found. Then we amalgamated some more, and mesons were found. Therefore, at any stage of the game, it al- ways looks rather messy. A great deal is amalgamated, but there are always many wires or threads hanging out in all directions. That is the situation today, which we shall try to describe. Some historic examples of amalgamation are the following. First, take  heat  and  mechanics.  When atoms are in motion, the more mo- tion, the more heat the system contains, and so  heat and all tem- perature effects can be represented by the laws of mechanics.  Another tremendous amalgamation was the discovery of the relation be- tween electricity, magnetism, and light, which were found to be different aspects of the same thing, which we call today the  electro- magnetic ﬁeld.  Another amalgamation is the uniﬁcation of chemical phenomena, the various properties of various substances, and the behavior======================================================== energy. Kinetic energy To illustrate another type of energy we consider a pendulum (Fig. 4-7). If we pull the mass aside and release it, it swings back and forth. In its motion, it loses height in going from either end to the center. Where does the potential energy go? Gravitational energy disappears when it is down at the bottom; nevertheless, it will climb up again. The gravitational energy must have gone into another form. Evidently it is by virtue of its  motion  that it is able to climb up again, so we have the conversion of gravitational energy into some other form when it reaches the bottom. We must get a formula for the energy of motion. Now, recalling our arguments about reversible machines, we can easily see that in the motion at the bottom must be a quantity of energy which per- mits it to rise a certain height, and which has nothing to do with the  machinery  by which it comes up or the  path  by which it comes up. So we have an equivalence formula something like the one we wrote for the child’s blocks. We have another form to represent the energy. It is easy to say what it is. The kinetic energy at the bottom equals the weight times the height that it could go, corresponding to its velocity: K.E. =  WH.  What we need is the formula which tells us the height by some rule that has to do with the motion of ob- jects. If we start something out with a certain velocity, say, straight 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:01 PM  Page 80 up, it will reach a certain height; we do not know what it is yet, but it depends on the velocity—there is a formula for that. Then to ﬁnd the formula for kinetic energy for an object moving with velocity  V,  we must calculate the height that it could reach, and multiply by the weight. We shall soon ﬁnd that we can write it this way: (4.6) Of course, the fact that motion has energy has nothing to do with the fact that we are in a gravitational ﬁeld. It makes no difference where  the motion came from. This is a general formula for various velocities. Both (4.3) and (4.6) are approximate formulas, the ﬁrst because it is incorrect when the heights are great, i.e., when the heights are so high that gravity is weakening; the second, because of the relativistic correction at high speeds. However, when we do ﬁnally get the exact formula for the energy, then the law of conser- vation of energy is correct. Other forms of energy We can continue in this way to illustrate the existence of energy in other forms. First, consider elastic energy. If we pull down on a spring, we must do some work, for when we have it down, we can lift weights with it. Therefore in its stretched condition it has a pos- sibility of doing some work. If we were to evaluate the sums of K.E. WV = / 2 2 . g 81 Conservation of Energy Figure 4-7 Pendulum. 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:01 PM  Page 81 weights times heights, it would not check out—we must add some- thing else to account for the fact that the spring is under tension. Elastic energy is the formula for a spring when it is stretched. How much energy is it? If we let go, the elastic energy, as the spring passes through the equilibrium point, is converted to kinetic energy and it goes back and forth between compressing or stretching the spring and kinetic energy of motion. (There is also some gravitational en- ergy going in and out, but we can do this experiment “sideways” if we like.) It keeps going until the losses—Aha! We have cheated all the way through by putting on little weights to move things or say- ing that the machines are reversible, or that they go on forever, but we can see that things do stop, eventually. Where is the energy when the spring has ﬁnished moving up and down? This brings in another  form of energy:  heat energy. Inside a spring or a lever there are crystals which are made up of lots of atoms, and with great care and delicacy in the arrangement of the parts one can try to adjust things so that as something rolls on something else, none of the atoms do any jiggling at all. But one must be very careful. Ordinarily when things roll, there is bumping and jiggling because of the irregularities of the material, and the atoms start to wiggle inside. So we lose track of that energy; we ﬁnd the atoms are wiggling inside in a random and confused manner after the motion slows down. There is still kinetic energy, all right, but it is not associated with visible motion. What a dream! How do we  know  there is still kinetic energy? It turns out that with thermometers you can ﬁnd out that, in fact, the spring or the lever is  warmer , and that there is really an increase of kinetic energy by a deﬁnite amount. We call this form of energy  heat energy , but we know that it is not really a new form, it is just kinetic energy— internal motion. (One of the difficulties with all these experiments with matter that we do on a large scale is that we cannot really dem- onstrate the conservation of energy and we cannot really make our======================================================== Of course, if we watch long enough, we may eventually catch on to a few of the rules.

We have implied that in our experimental arrangement (or even in the best possible one) it would be impossible to predict exactly what would happen. We can only predict the odds! This would mean, if it were true, that physics has given up on the problem of trying to predict exactly what will happen in a deﬁnite circumstance. Yes! Physics  has  given up.  We do not know how to predict what would happen in a given circumstance,  and we believe now that it is im- possible, that the only thing that can be predicted is the probability of different events. It must be recognized that this is a retrenchment in our earlier ideal of understanding nature. It may be a backward step, but no one has seen a way to avoid it. We make now a few remarks on a suggestion that has sometimes been made to try to avoid the description we have given: “Perhaps the electron has some kind of internal works—some inner variables— that we do not yet know about. Perhaps that is why we cannot predict what will happen. If we could look more closely at the electron we would be able to tell where it would end up.” So far as we know, that is impossible. We would still be in difficulty. Suppose we were to as- sume that inside the electron there is some kind of machinery that determines where it is going to end up. That machine must  also  de- termine which hole it is going to go through on its way. But we must not forget that what is inside the electron should not be dependent on what  we  do, and in particular upon whether we open or close one of the holes. So if an electron, before it starts, has already made up its mind (a) which hole it is going to use, and (b) where it is going 135 Quantum Behavior 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:01 PM  Page 135 to land, we should ﬁnd  P 1 for those electrons that have chosen hole 1,  P 2 for those that have chosen hole 2,  and necessarily  the sum  P 1 + P 2 for those that arrive through the  two holes. There  seems to be no way around this. But we have veriﬁed experimentally that that is not the case. And no one has ﬁgured a way out of this puzzle. So at the present time we must limit ourselves to computing probabilities. We say “at the present time,” but we suspect very strongly that it is some- thing that will be with us forever—that it is impossible to beat that puzzle—that this is the way nature really  is . The uncertainty principle This is the way Heisenberg stated the uncertainty principle origi- nally: If you make the measurement on any object, and you can determine the  x -component of its momentum with an uncertainty D p , you cannot, at the same time, know its  x -position more accu- rately than  . The uncertainties in the position and mo- mentum at any instant must have their product greater than half the reduced Planck constant. This is a special case of the uncer- tainty principle that was stated above more generally. The more general statement was that one cannot design equipment in any way to determine which of two alternatives is taken, without, at the same time, destroying the pattern of interference. Let us show for one particular case that the kind of relation given by Heisenberg must be true in order to keep from getting into trou- ble. We imagine a modiﬁcation of the experiment of Fig. 6-3, in which the wall with the holes consists of a plate mounted on rollers so that it can move freely up and down (in the  x -direction), as shown in Fig. 6-6. By watching the motion of the plate carefully we can try to tell which hole an electron goes through. Imagine what happens when the detector is placed at  x = 0. We would expect that an electron which passes through hole 1 must be deﬂected downward by the plate to reach the detector. Since the vertical com- ponent of the electron momentum is changed, the plate must recoil with an equal momentum in the opposite direction. The plate will / xp 2 ' $ DD 136 Six Easy Pieces 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:01 PM  Page 136 get an upward kick. If the electron goes through the lower hole, the plate should feel a downward kick. It is clear that for every po- sition of the detector, the momentum received by the plate will have a different value for a traversal via hole 1 than for a traversal via hole 2. So! Without disturbing the electrons  at all,  but just by watching the  plate,  we can tell which path the electron used. Now in order to do this it is necessary to know what the mo- mentum of the screen is, before the electron goes through. So when we measure the momentum after the electron goes by, we can ﬁgure out how much the plate’s momentum has changed. But remember, according to the uncertainty principle we cannot at the same time know the position of the plate with an arbitrary accuracy. But if we do not know exactly  where  the plate is we cannot say precisely where the two holes are. They will be in a different place for every electron that goes======================================================== agglomerated into clusters. Perhaps gravitation exists even over distances of  tens of millions  of light-years; so far as we now know, gravity seems to go out forever inversely as the square of the distance. Not only can we understand the nebulae, but from the law of gravitation we can even get some ideas about the origin of the stars. If we have a big cloud of dust and gas, as indicated in Fig. 5-11, the gravitational attractions of the pieces of dust for one another 103 The Theory of Gravitation Figure 5-8 A globular star cluster. 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:01 PM  Page 103 might make them form little lumps. Barely visible in the ﬁgure are “little” black spots which may be the beginning of the accumulations of dust and gases which, due to their gravitation, begin to form stars. Whether we have ever seen a star form or not is still debatable. Fig- ure 5-12 shows the one piece of evidence which suggests that we have. At the left is a picture of a region of gas with some stars in it taken in 1947, and at the right is another picture, taken only seven years later, which shows two new bright spots. Has gas accumulated, has gravity acted hard enough and collected it into a ball big enough that the stellar nuclear reaction starts in the interior and turns it into a star? Perhaps, and perhaps not. It is unreasonable that in only seven years we should be so lucky as to see a star change itself into visible form; it is much less probable that we should see  two! Cavendish’s experiment Gravitation, therefore, extends over enormous distances. But if there is a force between  any  pair of objects, we ought to be able to measure the force between our own objects. Instead of having to 104 Six Easy Pieces Figure 5-9 A galaxy. 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:01 PM  Page 104 watch the stars go around each other, why can we not take a ball of lead and a marble and watch the marble go toward the ball of lead? The difficulty of this experiment when done in such a simple man- ner is the very weakness or delicacy of the force. It must be done with extreme care, which means covering the apparatus to keep the air out, making sure it is not electrically charged, and so on; then the force can be measured. It was ﬁrst measured by Cavendish with an apparatus which is schematically indicated in Fig. 5-13. This ﬁrst demonstrated the direct force between two large, ﬁxed balls of lead and two smaller balls of lead on the ends of an arm supported by a very ﬁne ﬁber, called a torsion ﬁber. By measuring how much the ﬁber gets twisted, one can measure the strength of the force, verify that it is inversely proportional to the square of the distance, and determine how strong it is. Thus, one may accurately deter- mine the coefficient  G  in the formula .

You say, “We knew it al- ready for the earth.” Yes, but we did not know the  mass  of the earth. By knowing  G  from this experiment and by knowing how strongly the earth attracts, we can indirectly learn how great is the mass of the earth! This experiment has been called “weighing the earth” by some people, and it can be used to determine the coefficient   G  of the gravity law. This is the only way in which the mass of the earth can be determined.  G  turns out to be 6.670  ¥ 10 –11 newton ∙ m 2 /kg 2 . It is hard to exaggerate the importance of the effect on the history of science produced by this great success of the theory of gravitation. Compare the confusion, the lack of conﬁdence, the incomplete knowledge that prevailed in the earlier ages, when there were endless debates and paradoxes, with the clarity and simplicity of this law— this fact that all the moons and planets and stars have such a  simple 106 Six Easy Pieces Figure 5-11 An interstellar dust cloud. 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:01 PM  Page 106 rule  to govern them, and further that man could  understand  it and deduce how the planets should move! This is the reason for the success of the sciences in following years, for it gave hope that the other phe- nomena of the world might also have such beautifully simple laws. What is gravity? But is this such a simple law? What about the machinery of it? All we have done is to describe  how  the earth moves around the sun, but we have not said  what makes it go.  Newton made no hypotheses about this; he was satisﬁed to ﬁnd  what  it did without getting into the machinery of it.  No one has since given any machinery.  It is char- acteristic of the physical laws that they have this abstract character. The law of conservation of energy is a theorem concerning quan- tities that have to be calculated and added together, with no men- tion of the machinery, and likewise the great laws of mechanics are quantitative mathematical laws for which no machinery is available. 107 The Theory of======================================================== changing, but if we could see it a billion times magniﬁed, we would see that from its own point of view it is always changing: molecules are leaving the surface, molecules are coming back. Why do  we  see  no change ? Because just as many molecules are leaving as are coming back! In the long run “nothing happens.” If we then take the top of the vessel off and blow the moist air away, replacing it with dry air, then the number of molecules leaving is just the same as it was before, because this depends on the jiggling of the water, but the number coming back is greatly reduced be- cause there are so many fewer water molecules above the water. Therefore there are more going out than coming in, and the water evaporates. Hence, if you wish to evaporate water turn on the fan! Here is something else: Which molecules leave? When a mole- cule leaves it is due to an accidental, extra accumulation of a little bit more than ordinary energy, which it needs if it is to break away from the attractions of its neighbors. Therefore, since those that leave have more energy than the average, the ones that are left have less  average motion than they had before. So the liquid gradually cools  if it evaporates. Of course, when a molecule of vapor comes from the air to the water below there is a sudden great attraction as the molecule approaches the surface. This speeds up the incoming molecule and results in generation of heat. So when they leave they take away heat; when they come back they generate heat. Of course when there is no net evaporation the result is nothing—the water is not changing temperature. If we blow on the water so as to main- tain a continuous preponderance in the number evaporating, then the water is cooled. Hence, blow on soup to cool it! Of course you should realize that the processes just described are more complicated than we have indicated. Not only does the water go into the air, but also, from time to time, one of the oxygen or nitrogen molecules will come in and “get lost” in the mass of water molecules, and work its way into the water. Thus the air dissolves in the water; oxygen and nitrogen molecules will work their way 12 Six Easy Pieces 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:00 PM  Page 12 into the water and the water will contain air. If we suddenly take the air away from the vessel, then the air molecules will leave more rapidly than they come in, and in doing so will make bubbles. This is very bad for divers, as you may know. Now we go on to another process. In Fig. 1-6 we see, from an atomic point of view, a solid dissolving in water. If we put a crystal of salt in the water, what will happen? Salt is a solid, a crystal, an organized arrangement of “salt atoms.” Figure 1-7 is an illustration of the three-dimensional structure of common salt, sodium chlo- ride. Strictly speaking, the crystal is not made of atoms, but of what we call  ions.  An ion is an atom which either has a few extra electrons or has lost a few electrons. In a salt crystal we ﬁnd chlorine ions (chlorine atoms with an extra electron) and sodium ions (sodium atoms with one electron missing). The ions all stick together by electrical attraction in the solid salt, but when we put them in the water we ﬁnd, because of the attractions of the negative oxygen and positive hydrogen for the ions, that some of the ions jiggle loose. In Fig. 1-6 we see a chlorine ion getting loose, and other atoms ﬂoating in the water in the form of ions. This picture was made with some care. Notice, for example, that the hydrogen ends of the water mol- ecules are more likely to be near the chlorine ion, while near the sodium ion we are more likely to ﬁnd the oxygen end, because the 13 Atoms in Motion Figure 1-6 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:01 PM  Page 13 sodium is positive and the oxygen end of the water is negative, and they attract electrically. Can we tell from this picture whether the salt is  dissolving in  water or  crystallizing out  of water? Of course we cannot  tell, because while some of the atoms are leaving the crystal other atoms are rejoining it. The process is a  dynamic  one, just as in the case of evaporation, and it depends on whether there is more or less salt in the water than the amount needed for equilibrium. By equilibrium we mean that situation in which the rate at which atoms are leaving just matches the rate at which they are coming back. If there is almost no salt in the water, more atoms leave than return, and the salt dissolves. If, on the other hand, there are too many “salt atoms,” more return than leave, and the salt is crystallizing. In passing, we mention that the concept of a  molecule  of a sub- stance is only approximate and exists only for a certain class of sub- stances. It is clear in the case of water that the three atoms are actually stuck together. It is not so clear in the case of sodium chlo- ride in the solid. There is just an arrangement of sodium and chlo- rine ions in a cubic pattern.======================================================== sentence passed on to the next generations of creatures, what statement would contain the most information in the fewest words? I believe it is the  atomic hypothesis  (or the atomic  fact,  or whatever you wish to call it) that  all things are made of atoms—little particles that move around in perpetual motion, at- tracting each other when they are a little distance apart, but repelling upon being squeezed into one another.  In that one sentence, you will see, there is an  enormous  amount of information about the world, if just a little imagination and thinking are applied. To illustrate the power of the atomic idea, suppose that we have a drop of water a quarter of an inch on the side. If we look at it very closely we see nothing but water—smooth, continuous water. Even if we magnify it with the best optical microscope available— roughly two thousand times—then the water drop will be roughly forty feet across, about as big as a large room, and if we looked rather closely, we would  still  see relatively smooth water—but here and there small football-shaped things swimming back and forth. Very interesting. These are paramecia. You may stop at this point and get so curious about the paramecia with their wiggling cilia and twisting bodies that you go no further, except perhaps to mag- nify the paramecia still more and see inside. This, of course, is a subject for biology, but for the present we pass on and look still more closely at the water material itself, magnifying it two thousand times again. Now the drop of water extends about ﬁfteen miles across, and if we look very closely at it we see a kind of teeming, something which no longer has a smooth appearance—it looks something like a crowd at a football game as seen from a very great 4 Six Easy Pieces 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:00 PM  Page 4 distance. In order to see what this teeming is about, we will magnify it another two hundred and ﬁfty times and we will see something similar to what is shown in Fig. 1-1. This is a picture of water mag- niﬁed a billion times, but idealized in several ways. In the ﬁrst place, the particles are drawn in a simple manner with sharp edges, which is inaccurate. Secondly, for simplicity, they are sketched almost schematically in a two-dimensional arrangement, but of course they are moving around in three dimensions. Notice that there are two kinds of “blobs” or circles to represent the atoms of oxygen (black) and hydrogen (white), and that each oxygen has two hydrogens tied to it. (Each little group of an oxygen with its two hydrogens is called a molecule.) The picture is idealized further in that the real particles in nature are continually jiggling and bouncing, turning and twisting around one another. You will have to imagine this as a dynamic rather than a static picture. Another thing that cannot be illustrated in a drawing is the fact that the particles are “stuck together”—that they attract each other, this one pulled by that one, etc. The whole group is “glued together,” so to speak. On the other hand, the particles do not squeeze through each other. If you try to squeeze two of them too close together, they repel. The atoms are 1 or 2  ¥ 10 –8 cm in radius. Now 10 –8 cm is called an  angstrom  (just as another name), so we say they are 1 or 2 angstroms (Å) in radius. Another way to remember their size is this: if an apple is magniﬁed to the size of the earth, then the atoms in the apple are approximately the size of the original apple. Now imagine this great drop of water with all of these jiggling particles stuck together and tagging along with each other. The water keeps its volume; it does not fall apart, because of the attrac- tion of the molecules for each other. If the drop is on a slope, where it can move from one place to another, the water will ﬂow, but it does not just disappear—things do not just ﬂy apart—because of the molecular attraction. Now the jiggling motion is what we rep- resent as  heat:  when we increase the temperature, we increase the motion. If we heat the water, the jiggling increases and the volume between the atoms increases, and if the heating continues there 5 Atoms in Motion 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:00 PM  Page 5 comes a time when the pull between the molecules is not enough to hold them together and they  do  ﬂy apart and become separated from one another. Of course, this is how we manufacture steam out of water—by increasing the temperature; the particles ﬂy apart because of the increased motion. In Fig. 1-2 we have a picture of steam. This picture of steam fails in one respect: at ordinary atmospheric pressure there certainly would not be as many as three in this ﬁgure. Most squares this size would contain none—but we accidentally have two and a half or three in the picture (just so it would not be completely blank). Now in the case of steam we see the characteristic molecules more clearly than in the case of water. For simplicity, the molecules are======================================================== use, we must know where the atoms are located. In order to understand the chemistry, we must know exactly what atoms are present, for otherwise we cannot analyze it. That is but one limita- tion, of course. There is another  kind  of problem in the sister sciences which does not exist in physics; we might call it, for lack of a better term, the historical question. How did it get that way? If we understand all about biology, we will want to know how all the things which are on the earth got there. There is the theory of evolution, an im- portant part of biology. In geology, we not only want to know how the mountains are forming, but how the entire earth was formed in the beginning, the origin of the solar system, etc. That, of course, leads us to want to know what kind of matter there was in the world. How did the stars evolve? What were the initial conditions? That is the problem of astronomical history. A great deal has been found out about the formation of stars, the formation of elements from which we were made, and even a little about the origin of the universe. There is no historical question being studied in physics at the present time. We do not have a question, “Here are the laws of physics, how did they get that way?” We do not imagine, at the moment, that the laws of physics are somehow changing with time, that they were different in the past than they are at present. Of course they  may  be, and the moment we ﬁnd they  are,  the historical question of physics will be wrapped up with the rest of the history of the universe, and then the physicist will be talking about the same problems as astronomers, geologists, and biologists. Finally, there is a physical problem that is common to many ﬁelds, that is very old, and that has not been solved. It is not the 65 The Relation of Physics to Other Sciences 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:01 PM  Page 65 problem of ﬁnding new fundamental particles, but something left over from a long time ago—over a hundred years. Nobody in physics has really been able to analyze it mathematically satisfacto- rily in spite of its importance to the sister sciences. It is the analysis of  circulating or turbulent ﬂuids.  If we watch the evolution of a star, there comes a point where we can deduce that it is going to start convection, and thereafter we can no longer deduce what should happen. A few million years later the star explodes, but we cannot ﬁgure out the reason. We cannot analyze the weather. We do not know the patterns of motions that there should be inside the earth. The simplest form of the problem is to take a pipe that is very long and push water through it at high speed. We ask: to push a given amount of water through that pipe, how much pressure is needed? No one can analyze it from ﬁrst principles and the properties of water. If the water ﬂows very slowly, or if we use a thick goo like honey, then we can do it nicely. You will ﬁnd that in your textbook. What we really cannot do is deal with actual, wet water running through a pipe. That is the central problem which we ought to solve someday, and we have not. A poet once said, “The whole universe is in a glass of wine.” We will probably never know in what sense he meant that, for poets do not write to be understood. But it is true that if we look at a glass of wine closely enough we see the entire universe. There are the things of physics: the twisting liquid which evaporates depend- ing on the wind and weather, the reﬂections in the glass, and our imagination adds the atoms. The glass is a distillation of the earth’s rocks, and in its composition we see the secrets of the universe’s age, and the evolution of stars. What strange array of chemicals are in the wine? How did they come to be? There are the ferments, the enzymes, the substrates, and the products. There in wine is found the great generalization: all life is fermentation. Nobody can dis- cover the chemistry of wine without discovering, as did Louis Pas- teur, the cause of much disease. How vivid is the claret, pressing its existence into the consciousness that watches it! If our small 66 Six Easy Pieces 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:01 PM  Page 66 minds, for some convenience, divide this glass of wine, this uni- verse, into parts—physics, biology, geology, astronomy, psychology, and so on—remember that nature does not know it! So let us put it all back together, not forgetting ultimately what it is for. Let it give us one more ﬁnal pleasure: drink it and forget it all! 67 The Relation of Physics to Other Sciences 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:01 PM  Page 67 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:01 PM  Page 68 CONSERVATION OF ENERGY What is energy? In this chapter, we begin our more detailed study of the differ- ent aspects of physics, having ﬁnished our description of things in general. To illustrate the ideas and the kind of reasoning that might be used in theoretical physics, we shall now examine one of the most======================================================== with the forms actually exhibited by crystals as they occur in nature. The angles between the various “faces” of a crystal agree, within seconds of arc, with angles deduced on the assump- tion that a crystal is made of many “layers” of atoms. Everything is made of atoms.  That is the key hypothesis. The most important hypothesis in all of biology, for example, is that  every- thing that animals do, atoms do.  In other words,  there is nothing that living things do that cannot be understood from the point of view that they are made of atoms acting according to the laws of physics.  This was not known from the beginning: it took some experimenting and theorizing to suggest this hypothesis, but now it is accepted, and it is the most useful theory for producing new ideas in the ﬁeld of biology. If a piece of steel or a piece of salt, consisting of atoms one next to the other, can have such interesting properties; if water—which is nothing but these little blobs, mile upon mile of the same thing over the earth—can form waves and foam, and make rushing noises and strange patterns as it runs over cement; if all of this, all the life of a stream of water, can be nothing but a pile of atoms,  how much more is possible ? If instead of arranging the atoms in some deﬁnite pattern, again and again repeated, on and on, or even forming little lumps of complexity like the odor of violets, we make an arrange- ment which is  always different  from place to place, with different kinds of atoms arranged in many ways, continually changing, not repeating, how much more marvelously is it possible that this thing might behave? Is it possible that that “thing” walking back and forth in front of you, talking to you, is a great glob of these atoms 20 Six Easy Pieces 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:01 PM  Page 20 in a very complex arrangement, such that the sheer complexity of it staggers the imagination as to what it can do? When we say we are a pile of atoms, we do not mean we are  merely  a pile of atoms, because a pile of atoms which is not repeated from one to the other might well have the possibilities which you see before you in the mirror. 21 Atoms in Motion 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:01 PM  Page 21 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:01 PM  Page 22 BASIC PHYSICS Introduction In this chapter, we shall examine the most fundamental ideas that we have about physics—the nature of things as we see them at the present time. We shall not discuss the history of how we know that all these ideas are true; you will learn these details in due time. The things with which we concern ourselves in science appear in myriad forms, and with a multitude of attributes. For example, if we stand on the shore and look at the sea, we see the water, the waves breaking, the foam, the sloshing motion of the water, the sound, the air, the winds and the clouds, the sun and the blue sky, and light; there is sand and there are rocks of various hardness and permanence, color and texture. There are animals and seaweed, hunger and disease, and the observer on the beach; there may be even happiness and thought. Any other spot in nature has a similar variety of things and inﬂuences. It is always as complicated as that, no matter where it is. Curiosity demands that we ask questions, that we try to put things together and try to understand this mul- titude of aspects as perhaps resulting from the action of a relatively small number of elemental things and forces acting in an inﬁnite variety of combinations. For example: Is the sand other than the rocks? That is, is the sand perhaps nothing but a great number of very tiny stones? Is the moon a great rock? If we understood rocks, would we  also understand the 23 2 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:01 PM  Page 23 sand and the moon? Is the wind a sloshing of the air analogous to the sloshing motion of the water in the sea? What common features do different movements have? What is common to different kinds of sound? How many different colors are there? And so on. In this way we try gradually to analyze all things, to put together things which at ﬁrst sight look different, with the hope that we may be able to  reduce  the number of  different  things and thereby under- stand them better. A few hundred years ago, a method was devised to ﬁnd partial answers to such questions.  Observation, reason,  and  experiment make up what we call the  scientiﬁc method.  We shall have to limit ourselves to a bare description of our basic view of what is some- times called  fundamental physics,  or fundamental ideas which have arisen from the application of the scientiﬁc method. What do we mean by “understanding” something? We can imag- ine that this complicated array of moving things which constitutes “the world” is something like a great chess game being played by the gods, and we are observers of the game. We do not know what the rules of the game are; all we are allowed to do is to  watch  the playing.======================================================== from that ob- tained with bullets (6.1). If we expand  we see that  (6.3) where  ▼ is the phase difference between  and  . In terms of the intensities, we could write (6.4) The last term in (6.4) is the “interference term.” So much for water waves. The intensity can have any value, and it shows interference. An experiment with electrons Now we imagine a similar experiment with electrons. It is shown diagrammatically in Fig. 6-3. We make an electron gun which con- sists of a tungsten wire heated by an electric current and surrounded by a metal box with a hole in it. If the wire is at a negative voltage with respect to the box, electrons emitted by the wire will be accel- erated toward the walls and some will pass through the hole. All the electrons which come out of the gun will have (nearly) the same he it 1 ~ t h 1 t he it 2 ~ t | | h 1 2 t | | h 2 2 t () hh e it 12 + ~ tt | 2 | hh 12 + tt . ,, || | 2 || | Ih Ih I h h 11 2 22 2 12 1 2 == = + tt t t | 2 | hh 12 + tt |cos , d h | | h 2| + | + h | | h | 2 = 12 1 2 2 2 12 | | hh + tt t t tt h 1 t 2c o s II I I I . 12 1 2 1 2 =++ d h 2 t 122 Six Easy Pieces 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:01 PM  Page 122 energy. In front of the gun is again a wall (just a thin metal plate) with two holes in it. Beyond the wall is another plate which will serve as a “backstop.” In front of the backstop we place a movable detector. The detector might be a geiger counter or, perhaps better, an electron multiplier, which is connected to a loudspeaker. We should say right away that you should not try to set up this experiment (as you could have done with the two we have already described). This experiment has never been done in just this way. The trouble is that the apparatus would have to be made on an im- possibly small scale to show the effects we are interested in. We are doing a “thought experiment,” which we have chosen because it is easy to think about. We know the results that  would  be obtained because there  are  many experiments that have been done, in which the scale and the proportions have been chosen to show the effects we shall describe. The ﬁrst thing we notice with our electron experiment is that we hear sharp “clicks” from the detector (that is, from the loud- speaker). And all “clicks” are the same. There are  no  “half-clicks.” We would also notice that the “clicks” come very erratically. Something like: click . . . . . click-click . . . click . . . . . . . . click . . . . 123 Quantum Behavior Figure 6-3 Interference experiment with electrons. 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:01 PM  Page 123 click-click . . . . . . click . . . , etc., just as you have, no doubt, heard a geiger counter operating. If we count the clicks which arrive in a sufficiently long time—say, for many minutes—and then count again for another equal period, we ﬁnd that the two numbers are very nearly the same. So we can speak of the  average rate  at which the clicks are heard (so-and-so-many clicks per minute on the average). As we move the detector around, the  rate  at which the clicks ap- pear is faster or slower, but the size (loudness) of each click is always the same. If we lower the temperature of the wire in the gun the rate of clicking slows down, but still each click sounds the same. We would notice also that if we put two separate detectors at the backstop, one  or  the other would click, but never both at once. (Ex- cept that once in a while, if there were two clicks very close together in time, our ear might not sense the separation.) We conclude, therefore, that whatever arrives at the backstop arrives in “lumps.” All the “lumps” are the same size: only whole “lumps” arrive, and they arrive one at a time at the backstop. We shall say: “Electrons always arrive in identical lumps.” Just as for our experiment with bullets, we can now proceed to ﬁnd experimentally the answer to the question: “What is the rel- ative probability that an electron  ‘lump’ will arrive at the backstop at various distances  x  from the center?” As before, we obtain the relative probability by observing the rate of clicks, holding the operation of the gun  constant. The probability that lumps will ar- rive at a particular  x is proportional to the average rate of clicks at that  x . The result of our experiment is the interesting curve marked  P 12 in part (c) of Fig. 6-3. Yes! That is the way electrons go. The interference of electron waves Now let us try to analyze the curve of Fig. 6-3 to see whether we can understand the behavior of the electrons. The ﬁrst thing we would say is that since they come in lumps, each lump, which  we may as 124 Six Easy Pieces 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:01 PM  Page 124 well call an electron, has come either through hole 1 or through hole 2. Let us write this in the form of a “Proposition”: Proposition A : Each electron  either  goes through hole 1  or  it goes through hole 2. Assuming Proposition A, all electrons that arrive at the backstop can======================================================== electrons as they pass by 129 Quantum Behavior 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:01 PM  Page 129 does  not  get weaker.  It is always the same-sized ﬂash.  The only  thing that happens as the light is made dimmer  is that sometimes we hear a “click” from the detector but see  no ﬂash at all.  The electron has gone by without being “seen.” What we are observing is that light also  acts like electrons; we  knew  that it was “wavy,” but now we ﬁnd that it is also “lumpy.” It always arrives—or is scattered—  in lumps that we call “photons.” As we turn down the  intensity  of the light source we do not change the  size  of the photons, only the rate  at which they are emitted.  That  explains why, when our source is dim, some electrons get by without being seen. There did not happen to be a photon around at the time the electron went through. This is all a little discouraging. If it is true that whenever we “see” the electron we see the same-sized ﬂash, then those electrons we see are  always  the disturbed ones. Let us try the experiment with a dim light anyway. Now whenever we hear a click in the detector we will keep a count in three columns: in Column 1 those electrons seen by hole 1, in Column 2 those electrons seen by hole 2, and in Column 3 those electrons not seen at all. When we work up our data (computing the probabilities) we ﬁnd these results: Those “seen by hole 1” have a distribution like  P' 1 ; those “seen by hole 2” have a distribution like  P' 2  (so that those “seen by either hole 1 or 2” have a distribution like  P' 12 ); and those “not seen at all” have a “wavy” distribution just like  P 12 of Fig. 6-3!  If the electrons are not seen, we have interference! That is understandable. When we do not see the electron, no photon disturbs it, and when we do see it, a photon has disturbed it. There is always the same amount of disturbance because the light photons all produce the same-sized effects and the effect of the photons being scattered is enough to smear out any interference effect. Is there not  some  way we can see the electrons without disturbing them? We learned in an earlier chapter that the momentum carried by a “photon” is inversely proportional to its wavelength ( p = h/ l ). Certainly the jolt given to the electron when the photon is scattered 130 Six Easy Pieces 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:01 PM  Page 130 toward our eye depends on the momentum that photon carries. Aha! If we want to disturb the electrons only slightly we should not have lowered the  intensity  of the light; we should have lowered its frequency  (the same as increasing its wavelength). Let us use light of a redder color. We could even use infrared light, or radiowaves (like radar), and “see” where the electron went with the help of some equipment that can “see” light of these longer wavelengths. If we use “gentler” light perhaps we can avoid disturbing the elec- trons so much. Let us try the experiment with longer waves. We shall keep re- peating our experiment, each time with light of a longer wave- length. At ﬁrst, nothing seems to change. The results are the same. Then a terrible thing happens. You remember that when we dis- cussed the microscope we pointed out that, due to the  wave nature of the light, there is a limitation on how close two spots can be and still be seen as two separate spots. This distance is of the order of the wavelength of light. So now, when we make the wavelength longer than the distance between our holes, we see a  big  fuzzy ﬂash when the light is scattered by the electrons. We can no longer tell which hole the electron went through! We just know it went some- where! And it is just with light of this color that we ﬁnd that the jolts given to the electron are small enough so that  P' 12 begins to look like  P 12 —that we begin to get some interference effect. And it is only for wavelengths much longer than the separation of the two holes (when we have no chance at all of telling where the elec- tron went) that the disturbance due to the light gets sufficiently small that we again get the curve  P 12 shown in Fig. 6-3. In our experiment we ﬁnd that it is impossible to arrange the light in such a way that one can tell which hole the electron went through, and at the same time not disturb the pattern. It was sug- gested by Heisenberg that the then-new laws of nature could only be consistent if there were some basic limitation on our experimen- tal capabilities not previously recognized. He proposed, as a general principle, his  uncertainty principle,  which we can state in terms of our experiment as follows: “It is impossible to design an apparatus 131 Quantum Behavior 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:01 PM  Page 131 to determine which hole the electron passes through, that will not at the same time disturb the electrons enough to destroy the inter- ference pattern.” If an apparatus is capable of determining which hole the electron goes through, it  cannot  be so======================================================== (aside from gravity). When they come close together, they can “see inside” each other and rearrange their charges, with the result that they have a very strong interaction. The ultimate basis of an interaction be- tween the atoms is  electrical.  Since this force is so enormous, all the plusses and all minuses will normally come together in as in- timate a combination as they can. All things, even ourselves, are made of ﬁne-grained, enormously strongly interacting plus and minus parts, all neatly balanced out. Once in a while, by accident, we may rub off a few minuses or a few plusses (usually it is easier to rub off minuses), and in those circumstances we ﬁnd the force of electricity  unbalanced,  and we can then see the effects of these electrical attractions. To give an idea of how much stronger electricity is than gravita- tion, consider two grains of sand, a millimeter across, thirty meters apart. If the force between them were not balanced, if everything attracted everything else instead of likes repelling, so that there were no cancellations, how much force would there be? There would be a force of  three million tons  between the two! You see, there is very, very  little excess or deﬁcit of the number of negative or positive charges necessary to produce appreciable electrical effects. This is, of course, the reason why you cannot see the difference between an electrically charged and an uncharged thing—so few particles are involved that they hardly make a difference in the weight or size of an object. With this picture the atoms were easier to understand. They were thought to have a “nucleus” at the center, which is positively electrically charged and very massive, and the nucleus is surrounded by a certain number of “electrons” which are very light and nega- tively charged. Now we go a little ahead in our story to remark that in the nucleus itself there were found two kinds of particles, protons and neutrons, almost of the same weight and very heavy. The pro- tons are electrically charged and the neutrons are neutral. If we have an atom with six protons inside its nucleus, and this is surrounded 29 Basic Physics 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:01 PM  Page 29 by six electrons (the negative particles in the ordinary world of mat- ter are all electrons, and these are very light compared with the pro- tons and neutrons which make nuclei), this would be atom number six in the chemical table, and it is called carbon. Atom number eight is called oxygen, etc., because the chemical properties depend upon the electrons on the  outside,  and in fact only upon  how many electrons there are. So the  chemical  properties of a substance depend only on a number, the number of electrons. (The whole list of el- ements of the chemists really could have been called 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, etc. Instead of saying “carbon,” we could say “element six,” meaning six electrons, but of course, when the elements were ﬁrst discovered, it was not known that they could be numbered that way, and sec- ondly, it would make everything look rather complicated. It is bet- ter to have names and symbols for these things, rather than to call everything by number.) More was discovered about the electrical force. The natural in- terpretation of electrical interaction is that two objects simply at- tract each other: plus against minus. However, this was discovered to be an inadequate idea to represent it. A more adequate represen- tation of the situation is to say that the existence of the positive charge, in some sense, distorts, or creates a “condition” in space, so that when we put the negative charge in, it feels a force. This po- tentiality for producing a force is called an  electric ﬁeld.  When we put an electron in an electric ﬁeld, we say it is “pulled.” We then have two rules: (a) charges make a ﬁeld, and (b) charges in ﬁelds have forces on them and move. The reason for this will become clear when we discuss the following phenomena: If we were to charge a body, say a comb, electrically, and then place a charged piece of paper at a distance and move the comb back and forth, the paper will respond by always pointing to the comb. If we shake it faster, it will be discovered that the paper is a little behind,  there is a delay  in the action. (At the ﬁrst stage, when we move the comb rather slowly, we ﬁnd a complication which is  magnetism.  Magnetic inﬂuences have to do with  charges in relative motion,  so magnetic forces and electric forces can really be attributed to one ﬁeld, as two 30 Six Easy Pieces 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:01 PM  Page 30 different aspects of exactly the same thing. A changing electric ﬁeld cannot exist without magnetism.) If we move the charged paper farther out, the delay is greater. Then an interesting thing is ob- served. Although the forces between two charged objects should go inversely as the  square  of the distance, it is found, when we shake a charge, that the inﬂuence extends  very much======================================================== 5.5 x 8.25”  B: 7/16” BASIC PB BLACK  +PMS 108 +PMS 1655 +PMS 234 FINISH: Gritty Matte six  easy pieces “The most original mind of his generation.”   —Freeman Dyson 6 Richa R d   p .

Feynman’s research was directed mostly toward making sense of the results of this enterprise. A great unifying theme among particle physicists has been the role of symmetry and conservation laws in bringing order to the subatomic zoo. As it happens, many of the symmetries known to particle physi- cists were familiar already in classical physics. Chief among these are the symmetries that arise from the homogeneity of space and time. Take time: apart from cosmology, where the big bang marked the beginning of time, there is nothing in physics to distinguish one moment of time from the next. Physicists say that the world is “invariant under time translations,” meaning that whether you take midnight or midday to be the zero of time in your measurements, it makes no difference to the description of physical phenomena. Physical processes do not depend on an absolute zero of time. It turns out that this symmetry under time translation directly implies one of the most basic, and also most useful, laws of physics: the law of conservation of energy. This law says that you can move en- ergy around and change its form but you can’t create or destroy it. Feynman makes this law crystal clear with his amusing story of Dennis the Menace who is always mischievously hiding his toy building blocks from his mother (Chapter Four). The most challenging lecture in this volume is the last, which is an exposition on quantum physics. It is no exaggeration to say that quantum mechanics had dominated twentieth-century physics and is far and away the most successful scientiﬁc theory in existence. It is indispensable for understanding subatomic particles, atoms and nuclei, molecules and chemical bonding, the structure of solids, su- perconductors and superﬂuids, the electrical and thermal conduc- tivity of metals and semiconductors, the structure of stars, and much else. It has practical applications ranging from the laser to the microchip. All this from a theory that at ﬁrst sight—and second sight—looks absolutely crazy! Niels Bohr, one of the founders of xv Introduction 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:00 PM  Page xv quantum mechanics, once remarked that anybody who is not shocked by the theory hasn’t understood it. The problem is that quantum ideas strike at the very heart of what we might call commonsense reality. In particular, the idea that physical objects such as electrons or atoms enjoy an independent existence, with a complete set of physical properties at all times, is called into question. For example, an electron cannot have a posi- tion in space and a well-deﬁned speed at the same moment. If you look for where an electron is located, you will ﬁnd it at a place, and if you measure its speed you will obtain a deﬁnite answer, but you cannot make both observations at once. Nor is it meaningful to at- tribute deﬁnite yet unknown values for the position and speed to an electron in the absence of a complete set of observations. This indeterminism in the very nature of atomic particles is en- capsulated by Heisenberg’s celebrated uncertainty principle. This puts strict limits on the precision with which properties such as po- sition and speed can be simultaneously known. A sharp value for position smears the range of possible values of speed and vice versa. Quantum fuzziness shows up in the way electrons, photons, and other particles move. Certain experiments can reveal them taking deﬁnite paths through space, after the fashion of bullets following trajectories toward a target. But other experimental arrangements reveal that these entities can also behave like waves, showing char- acteristic patterns of diffraction and interference. Feynman’s masterly analysis of the famous “two-slit” experiment, which teases out the “shocking” wave-particle duality in its starkest form, has become a classic in the history of scientiﬁc exposition. With a few very simple ideas, Feynman manages to take the reader to the very heart of the quantum mystery, and leaves us dazzled by the paradoxical nature of reality that it exposes. Although quantum mechanics had made the textbooks by the early 1930s, it is typical of Feynman that, as a young man, he pre- ferred to refashion the theory for himself in an entirely new guise. The Feynman method has the virtue that it provides us with a vivid picture of nature’s quantum trickery at work. The idea is that the xvi Introduction 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:00 PM  Page xvi path of a======================================================== “zero mass”? The masses given here are the masses of the particles  at rest.  The fact that a particle has zero mass means, in a way, that it cannot  be  at  rest.  A photon is never at rest; it is al- ways moving at 186,000 miles a second. We will understand more what mass means when we understand the theory of relativity, which will come in due time. Thus we are confronted with a large number of particles, which together seem to be the fundamental constituents of matter. For- tunately, these particles are not  all  different in their  interactions  with one another. In fact, there seem to be just  four kinds  of interaction between particles which, in the order of decreasing strength, are the nuclear force, electrical interactions, the beta-decay interaction, and gravity. The photon is coupled to all charged particles and the strength of the interaction is measured by some number, which is 1 / 137 . The detailed law of this coupling is known, that is quantum electrodynamics. Gravity is coupled to all  energy,  but its coupling is extremely weak, much weaker than that of electricity. This law is also known. Then there are the so-called weak decays—beta decay, 43 Basic Physics 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:01 PM  Page 43 which causes the neutron to disintegrate into proton, electron, and neutrino, relatively slowly. This law is only partly known. The so- called strong interaction, the meson-baryon interaction, has a strength of 1 in this scale, and the law is completely unknown, al- though there are a number of known rules, such as that the number of baryons does not change in any reaction. This, then, is the horrible condition of our physics today. To summarize it, I would say this: outside the nucleus, we seem to know all; inside it, quantum mechanics is valid—the principles of quantum mechanics have not been found to fail. The stage on which we put all of our knowledge, we would say, is relativistic space-time; perhaps gravity is involved in space-time. We do not know how the universe got started, and we have never made exper- iments which check our ideas of space and time accurately, below some tiny distance, so we only  know  that our ideas work above that distance. We should also add that the rules of the game are the quantum-mechanical principles, and those principles apply, so far as we can tell, to the new particles as well as to the old. The origin of the forces in nuclei leads us to new particles, but unfortunately 44 Six Easy Pieces * The “strength” is a dimensionless measure of the coupling constant involved in each interaction ( means “of the order”).

We seem grad- ually to be groping toward an understanding of the world of sub- atomic particles, but we really do not know how far we have yet to go in this task. 45 Basic Physics 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:01 PM  Page 45 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:01 PM  Page 46 THE RELATION OF PHYSICS  TO OTHER SCIENCES Introduction Physics is the most fundamental and all-inclusive of the sci- ences, and has had a profound effect on all scientiﬁc develop- ment. In fact, physics is the present-day equivalent of what used to be called  natural philosophy,  from which most of our modern sci- ences arose. Students of many ﬁelds ﬁnd themselves studying physics because of the basic role it plays in all phenomena. In this chapter we shall try to explain what the fundamental problems in the other sciences are, but of course it is impossible in so small a space really to deal with the complex, subtle, beautiful matters in these other ﬁelds. Lack of space also prevents our discussing the re- lation of physics to engineering, industry, society, and war, or even the most remarkable relationship between mathematics and physics. (Mathematics is not a science from our point of view, in the sense that it is not a  natural  science. The test of its validity is not experiment.) We must, incidentally, make it clear from the be- ginning that if a thing is not a science, it is not necessarily bad. For example, love is not a science. So, if something is said not to be a science, it does not mean that there is something wrong with it; it just means that it is not a science. 47 3 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:01 PM  Page 47 Chemistry The science which is perhaps the most deeply affected by physics is chemistry. Historically, the early days of chemistry dealt almost entirely with what we now call inorganic chemistry, the chemistry of substances which are not associated with living things. Consid- erable analysis was required to discover the existence of the many elements and their relationships—how they make the various rela- tively simple compounds found in rocks,======================================================== nothing like  things on a large scale. That is what makes physics difficult—and very interesting. It is hard because the way things behave on a small scale is so “unnat- ural”; we have no direct experience with it. Here things behave like nothing we know of, so that it is impossible to describe this behav- ior in any other than analytic ways. It is difficult, and takes a lot of imagination. Quantum mechanics has many aspects. In the ﬁrst place, the 33 Basic Physics 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:01 PM  Page 33 idea that a particle has a deﬁnite location and a deﬁnite speed is no longer allowed; that is wrong. To give an example of how wrong clas- sical physics is, there is a rule in quantum mechanics that says that one cannot know both where something is  and how fast it is moving. The uncertainty of the momentum and the uncertainty of the posi- tion are complementary, and the product of the two is bounded by a small constant. We can write the law like this:  , but we shall explain it in more detail later. This rule is the explanation of a very mysterious paradox: If the atoms are made out of plus and minus charges, why don’t the minus charges simply sit on top of the plus charges (they attract each other) and get so close as to com- pletely cancel them out?  Why are atoms so big?  Why is the nucleus at the center with the electrons around it? It was ﬁrst thought that this was because the nucleus was so big; but no, the nucleus is  very small.  An atom has a diameter of about 10 –8 cm. The nucleus has a diameter of about 10 –13 cm. If we had an atom and wished to see the nucleus, we would have to magnify it until the whole atom was the size of a large room, and then the nucleus would be a bare speck which you could just about make out with the eye, but very nearly all the weight  of the atom is in that inﬁnitesimal  nucleus.  What keeps the electrons from simply falling in? This principle: If they were in the nucleus, we would know their position precisely, and the uncer- tainty principle would then require that they have a very  large  (but uncertain) momentum, i.e., a very large  kinetic energy.  With this en- ergy they would break away from the nucleus. They make a com- promise: they leave themselves a little room for this uncertainty and then jiggle with a certain amount of minimum motion in accor- dance with this rule. (Remember that when a crystal is cooled to absolute zero, we said that the atoms do not stop moving, they still jiggle. Why? If they stopped moving, we would know where they were and that they had zero motion, and that is against the uncer- tainty principle. We cannot know where they are and how fast they are moving, so they must be continually wiggling in there!) Another most interesting change in the ideas and philosophy / xp 2 ' $ DD 34 Six Easy Pieces 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:01 PM  Page 34 of science brought about by quantum mechanics is this: it is not possible to predict  exactly  what will happen in any circumstance. For example, it is possible to arrange an atom which is ready to emit light, and we can measure when it has emitted light by pick- ing up a photon particle, which we shall describe shortly. We can- not, however, predict  when  it is going to emit the light or, with several atoms,  which one  is going to. You may say that this is be- cause there are some internal “wheels” which we have not looked at closely enough. No, there  are  no internal wheels; nature, as we understand it today, behaves in such a way that it is  fundamentally impossible  to make a precise prediction of  exactly what will happen in a given experiment. This is a horrible thing; in fact, philosophers have said before that one of the fundamental requisites of science is that whenever you set up the same conditions, the same thing must happen. This is simply  not true;  it is  not  a fundamental con- dition of science. The fact is that the same thing does not happen, that we can ﬁnd only an average, statistically, as to what happens. Nevertheless, science has not completely collapsed. Philosophers, incidentally, say a great deal about what is  absolutely necessary  for science, and it is always, so far as one can see, rather naive, and probably wrong. For example, some philosopher or other said it is fundamental to the scientiﬁc effort that if an experiment is per- formed in, say, Stockholm, and then the same experiment is done in, say, Quito, the  same results  must occur. That is quite false. It is not necessary that  science  do that; it may be a  fact of experience,  but it is not necessary. For example, if one of the experiments is to look out at the sky and see the aurora borealis in Stockholm, you do not see it in Quito; that is a different phenomenon. “But,” you say, “that is something that has to do with the outside; can you close yourself up in a box in Stockholm and pull down the shade and get any difference?” Surely. If we take a pendulum on a uni- versal joint,======================================================== sentence passed on to the next generations of creatures, what statement would contain the most information in the fewest words? I believe it is the  atomic hypothesis  (or the atomic  fact,  or whatever you wish to call it) that  all things are made of atoms—little particles that move around in perpetual motion, at- tracting each other when they are a little distance apart, but repelling upon being squeezed into one another.  In that one sentence, you will see, there is an  enormous  amount of information about the world, if just a little imagination and thinking are applied. To illustrate the power of the atomic idea, suppose that we have a drop of water a quarter of an inch on the side. If we look at it very closely we see nothing but water—smooth, continuous water. Even if we magnify it with the best optical microscope available— roughly two thousand times—then the water drop will be roughly forty feet across, about as big as a large room, and if we looked rather closely, we would  still  see relatively smooth water—but here and there small football-shaped things swimming back and forth. Very interesting. These are paramecia. You may stop at this point and get so curious about the paramecia with their wiggling cilia and twisting bodies that you go no further, except perhaps to mag- nify the paramecia still more and see inside. This, of course, is a subject for biology, but for the present we pass on and look still more closely at the water material itself, magnifying it two thousand times again. Now the drop of water extends about ﬁfteen miles across, and if we look very closely at it we see a kind of teeming, something which no longer has a smooth appearance—it looks something like a crowd at a football game as seen from a very great 4 Six Easy Pieces 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:00 PM  Page 4 distance. In order to see what this teeming is about, we will magnify it another two hundred and ﬁfty times and we will see something similar to what is shown in Fig. 1-1. This is a picture of water mag- niﬁed a billion times, but idealized in several ways. In the ﬁrst place, the particles are drawn in a simple manner with sharp edges, which is inaccurate. Secondly, for simplicity, they are sketched almost schematically in a two-dimensional arrangement, but of course they are moving around in three dimensions. Notice that there are two kinds of “blobs” or circles to represent the atoms of oxygen (black) and hydrogen (white), and that each oxygen has two hydrogens tied to it. (Each little group of an oxygen with its two hydrogens is called a molecule.) The picture is idealized further in that the real particles in nature are continually jiggling and bouncing, turning and twisting around one another. You will have to imagine this as a dynamic rather than a static picture. Another thing that cannot be illustrated in a drawing is the fact that the particles are “stuck together”—that they attract each other, this one pulled by that one, etc. The whole group is “glued together,” so to speak. On the other hand, the particles do not squeeze through each other. If you try to squeeze two of them too close together, they repel. The atoms are 1 or 2  ¥ 10 –8 cm in radius. Now 10 –8 cm is called an  angstrom  (just as another name), so we say they are 1 or 2 angstroms (Å) in radius. Another way to remember their size is this: if an apple is magniﬁed to the size of the earth, then the atoms in the apple are approximately the size of the original apple. Now imagine this great drop of water with all of these jiggling particles stuck together and tagging along with each other. The water keeps its volume; it does not fall apart, because of the attrac- tion of the molecules for each other. If the drop is on a slope, where it can move from one place to another, the water will ﬂow, but it does not just disappear—things do not just ﬂy apart—because of the molecular attraction. Now the jiggling motion is what we rep- resent as  heat:  when we increase the temperature, we increase the motion. If we heat the water, the jiggling increases and the volume between the atoms increases, and if the heating continues there 5 Atoms in Motion 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:00 PM  Page 5 comes a time when the pull between the molecules is not enough to hold them together and they  do  ﬂy apart and become separated from one another. Of course, this is how we manufacture steam out of water—by increasing the temperature; the particles ﬂy apart because of the increased motion. In Fig. 1-2 we have a picture of steam. This picture of steam fails in one respect: at ordinary atmospheric pressure there certainly would not be as many as three in this ﬁgure. Most squares this size would contain none—but we accidentally have two and a half or three in the picture (just so it would not be completely blank). Now in the case of steam we see the characteristic molecules more clearly than in the case of water. For simplicity, the molecules are======================================================== electron apparatus we add a very strong light source, placed behind the wall and between the two holes, as shown in Fig. 6-4. We know that electric charges scatter light. So when an electron passes, however it does pass, on its way to the detector, it will scatter some light to our eye, and we can see  where the electron goes. If, for instance, an electron were to take the path via hole 2 that is sketched in Fig. 6-4, we should see a ﬂash of light coming from the vicinity of the place marked  A  in the ﬁg- ure. If an electron passes through hole 1 we would expect to see a ﬂash from the vicinity of the upper hole. If it should happen that we get light from both places  at the same time,  becausethe  electron divides in half . . . Let us just do the experiment! Here is what we see:  every  time that we hear a “click” from our electron detector (at the backstop), we  also see  a ﬂash of light  either near hole 1  or  near hole 2, but  never  both at once! And we observe the same result no matter where we put the detector. From this ob- servation we conclude that when we look at the electrons we ﬁnd that the electrons go either through one hole or the other. Experi- mentally, Proposition A is necessarily true. 127 Quantum Behavior 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:01 PM  Page 127 What, then, is wrong with our argument  against  Proposition A? Why  isn’t P 12 just equal to  P 1 +  P 2 ? Back to experiment! Let us keep track of the electrons and ﬁnd out what they are doing. For each position ( x -location) of the detector we will count the electrons that arrive and  also  keep track of which hole they went through, by watching for the ﬂashes. We can keep track of things this way: whenever we hear a “click” we will put a count in Column 1 if we see the ﬂash near hole 1, and if we see the ﬂash near hole 2, we will record a count in Column 2. Every electron which arrives is recorded in one of two classes: those which come through 1 and those which come through 2. From the number recorded in Col- umn 1 we get the probability  P' 1 that an electron will arrive at the detector via hole 1; and from the number recorded in Column 2 we get  P' 2 , the probability that an electron will arrive at the detector via hole 2. If we now repeat such a measurement for many values of  x , we get the curves for  P' 1 and  P' 2 shown in part (b) of Fig. 6- 4. Well, that is not too surprising! We get for  P' 1 something quite similar to what we got before for  P , by blocking off hole 2; and  P' 2 is similar to what we got by blocking hole 1. So there is  not  any complicated business like going through both holes. When we 128 Six Easy Pieces Figure 6-4 A different electron experiment. 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:01 PM  Page 128 watch them, the electrons come through just as we would expect them to come through. Whether the holes are closed or open, those which we see come through hole 1 are distributed in the same way whether hole 2 is open or closed. But wait! What do we have  now  for the  total  probability, the probability that an electron will arrive at the detector by any route? We already have that information. We just pretend that we never looked at the light ﬂashes, and we lump together the detector clicks which we have separated into the two columns. We  must  just  add the numbers. For the probability that an electron will arrive at the backstop by passing through  either  hole, we do ﬁnd  P' 12 =  P' 1 +  P' 2 . That is, although we succeeded in watching which hole our elec- trons come through, we no longer get the old interference curve P 12 , but a new one,  P' 12 , showing no interference! If we turn out the light  P 12 is restored. We must conclude that  when we look at the electrons  the distri- bution of them on the screen is different than when we do not look. Perhaps it is turning on our light source that disturbs things? It must be that the electrons are very delicate, and the light, when it scatters off the electrons, gives them a jolt that changes their mo- tion. We know that the electric ﬁeld of the light acting on a charge will exert a force on it. So perhaps we  should  expect the motion to be changed. Anyway, the light exerts a big inﬂuence on the elec- trons. By trying to “watch” the electrons we have changed their mo- tions. That is, the jolt given to the electron when the photon is scattered by it is such as to change the electron’s motion enough so that if it  might  have gone to where  P 12 was at a maximum, it will instead land where  P 12 was a minimum; that is why we no longer see the wavy interference effects. You may be thinking: “Don’t use such a bright source! Turn the brightness down! The light waves will then be weaker and will not disturb the electrons so much. Surely, by making the light dimmer and dimmer, eventually the wave will be weak enough that it will have a negligible effect.” OK. Let’s try it. The ﬁrst thing we observe is that the ﬂash of light scattered from the======================================================== of atomic particles, which is in the  quantum mechanics of chemistry. The question is, of course, is it going to be possible to amalga- mate  everything,  and merely discover that this world represents dif- ferent aspects of  one  thing? Nobody knows. All we know is that as we go along, we ﬁnd that we can amalgamate pieces, and then we ﬁnd some pieces that do not ﬁt, and we keep trying to put the jig- saw puzzle together. Whether there are a ﬁnite number of pieces, and whether there is even a border to the puzzle, are of course un- 26 Six Easy Pieces 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:01 PM  Page 26 known. It will never be known until we ﬁnish the picture, if ever. What we wish to do here is to see to what extent this amalgamation process has gone on, and what the situation is at present, in under- standing basic phenomena in terms of the smallest set of principles. To express it in a simple manner,  what are things made of and how few elements are there? Physics before 1920 It is a little difficult to begin at once with the present view, so we shall ﬁrst see how things looked in about 1920 and then take a few things out of that picture. Before 1920, our world picture was something like this: The “stage” on which the universe goes is the three-dimensional  space  of geometry, as described by Euclid, and things change in a medium called  time.  The elements on the stage are  particles,  for example the atoms, which have some  properties. First, the property of inertia: if a particle is moving it keeps on going in the same direction unless  forces  act upon it. The second element, then, is  forces,  which were then thought to be of two va- rieties: First, an enormously complicated, detailed kind of interac- tion force which held the various atoms in different combinations in a complicated way, which determined whether salt would dis- solve faster or slower when we raise the temperature. The other force that was known was a long-range interaction—a smooth and quiet attraction—which varied inversely as the square of the dis- tance, and was called  gravitation.  This law was known and was very simple.  Why  things remain in motion when they are moving, or why  there is a law of gravitation, was, of course, not known. A description of nature is what we are concerned with here. From this point of view, then, a gas, and indeed  all  matter, is a myr- iad of moving particles. Thus many of the things we saw while standing at the seashore can immediately be connected. First the pressure: this comes from the collisions of the atoms with the walls or whatever; the drift of the atoms, if they are all moving in one 27 Basic Physics 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:01 PM  Page 27 direction on the average, is wind; the  random  internal motions are the  heat.  There are waves of excess density, where too many par- ticles have collected, and so as they rush off they push up piles of particles farther out, and so on. This wave of excess density is sound.  It is a tremendous achievement to be able to understand so much. Some of these things were described in the previous chapter. What  kinds  of particles are there? There were considered to be 92 at that time: 92 different kinds of atoms were ultimately dis- covered. They had different names associated with their chemical properties. The next part of the problem was,  what are the short-range forces? Why does carbon attract one oxygen or perhaps two oxygens, but not three oxygens? What is the machinery of interaction between atoms? Is it gravitation? The answer is no. Gravity is entirely too weak. But imagine a force analogous to gravity, varying inversely with the square of the distance, but enormously more powerful and having one difference. In gravity everything attracts everything else, but now imagine that there are  two kinds  of “things,” and that this new force (which is the electrical force, of course) has the property that likes  repel  but unlikes  attract.  The “thing” that carries this strong interaction is called  charge. Then what do we have? Suppose that we have two unlikes that attract each other, a plus and a minus, and that they stick very close together. Suppose we have another charge some distance away. Would it feel any attraction? It would feel  practically none,  because if the ﬁrst two are equal in size, the attraction for the one and the repulsion for the other balance out. Therefore there is very little force at any appreciable distance. On the other hand, if we get  very close  with the extra charge,  attraction  arises, because the repulsion of likes and attraction of unlikes will tend to bring unlikes closer together and push likes farther apart. Then the repulsion will be less  than the attraction. This is the reason why the atoms, which are constituted out of plus and minus electric charges, feel very little 28 Six Easy Pieces 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:01 PM  Page 28 force when they are separated by appreciable distance======================================================== remained close to the real and often grubby world of experimental results. Nobody who watched the elderly Feynman elucidate the cause of the Chal- lenger space shuttle disaster by dipping an elastic band in ice water could doubt that here was both a showman and a very practical thinker. Initially, Feynman made a name for himself from his work on the theory of subatomic particles, speciﬁcally the topic known as quan- tum electrodynamics or QED. In fact, the quantum theory began with this topic. In 1900, the German physicist Max Planck pro- posed that light and other electromagnetic radiation, which had hitherto been regarded as waves, paradoxically behaved like tiny packets of energy, or “quanta,” when interacting with matter. These particular quanta became known as photons. By the early 1930s the architects of the new quantum mechanics had worked out a mathematical scheme to describe the emission and absorption of photons by electrically charged particles such as electrons. Although this early formulation of QED enjoyed some limited success, the theory was clearly ﬂawed. In many cases calculations gave incon- sistent and even inﬁnite answers to well-posed physical questions. x Introduction 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:00 PM  Page x It was to the problem of constructing a consistent theory of QED that the young Feynman turned his attention in the late 1940s. To place QED on a sound basis it was necessary to make the theory consistent not only with the principles of quantum mechan- ics but with those of the special theory of relativity too. These two theories come with their own distinctive mathematical machinery, complicated systems of equations that can indeed be combined and reconciled to yield a satisfactory description of QED. Doing this was a tough undertaking, requiring a high degree of mathematical skill, and was the approach followed by Feynman’s contemporaries. Feynman himself, however, took a radically different route—so rad- ical, in fact, that he was more or less able to write down the answers straightaway without using any mathematics! To aid this extraordinary feat of intuition, Feynman invented a simple system of eponymous diagrams. Feynman diagrams are a symbolic but powerfully heuristic way of picturing what is going on when electrons, photons, and other particles interact with each other. These days Feynman diagrams are a routine aid to calcula- tion, but in the early 1950s they marked a startling departure from the traditional way of doing theoretical physics. The particular problem of constructing a consistent theory of quantum electrodynamics, although it was a milestone in the de- velopment of physics, was just the start. It was to deﬁne a distinctive Feynman style, a style destined to produce a string of important results from a broad range of topics in physical science. The Feyn- man style can best be described as a mixture of reverence and dis- respect for received wisdom. Physics is an exact science, and the existing body of knowledge, while incomplete, can’t simply be shrugged aside. Feynman ac- quired a formidable grasp of the accepted principles of physics at a very young age, and he chose to work almost entirely on conven- tional problems. He was not the sort of genius to beaver away in isolation in a backwater of the discipline and to stumble across the profoundly new. His special talent was to approach essentially mainstream topics in an idiosyncratic way. This meant eschewing xi Introduction 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:00 PM  Page xi existing formalisms and developing his own highly intuitive ap- proach. Whereas most theoretical physicists rely on careful mathe- matical calculation to provide a guide and a crutch to take them into unfamiliar territory, Feynman’s attitude was almost cavalier. You get the impression that he could read nature like a book and simply report on what he found, without the tedium of complex analysis. Indeed, in pursuing his interests in this manner Feynman dis- played a healthy contempt for rigorous formalisms. It is hard to convey the depth of genius that is necessary to work like this. The- oretical physics is one of the toughest intellectual exercises, com- bining abstract concepts that defy visualization with extreme mathematical complexity. Only by adopting the highest standards of mental discipline can most physicists make progress. Yet Feyn- man appeared to ride roughshod over this strict code of practice and pluck new results like ready-made fruit from the Tree of Knowledge. The Feynman style owed a great deal to the personality of the man. In his professional and private life he seemed to treat the world as a hugely entertaining game. The physical universe pre- sented him with a fascinating series of puzzles and challenges, and so did his social environment. A lifelong prankster, he treated au- thority and the academic establishment with the same sort of dis- respect he showed for stuffy mathematical formalism. Never======================================================== electrons as they pass by 129 Quantum Behavior 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:01 PM  Page 129 does  not  get weaker.  It is always the same-sized ﬂash.  The only  thing that happens as the light is made dimmer  is that sometimes we hear a “click” from the detector but see  no ﬂash at all.  The electron has gone by without being “seen.” What we are observing is that light also  acts like electrons; we  knew  that it was “wavy,” but now we ﬁnd that it is also “lumpy.” It always arrives—or is scattered—  in lumps that we call “photons.” As we turn down the  intensity  of the light source we do not change the  size  of the photons, only the rate  at which they are emitted.  That  explains why, when our source is dim, some electrons get by without being seen. There did not happen to be a photon around at the time the electron went through. This is all a little discouraging. If it is true that whenever we “see” the electron we see the same-sized ﬂash, then those electrons we see are  always  the disturbed ones. Let us try the experiment with a dim light anyway. Now whenever we hear a click in the detector we will keep a count in three columns: in Column 1 those electrons seen by hole 1, in Column 2 those electrons seen by hole 2, and in Column 3 those electrons not seen at all. When we work up our data (computing the probabilities) we ﬁnd these results: Those “seen by hole 1” have a distribution like  P' 1 ; those “seen by hole 2” have a distribution like  P' 2  (so that those “seen by either hole 1 or 2” have a distribution like  P' 12 ); and those “not seen at all” have a “wavy” distribution just like  P 12 of Fig. 6-3!  If the electrons are not seen, we have interference! That is understandable. When we do not see the electron, no photon disturbs it, and when we do see it, a photon has disturbed it. There is always the same amount of disturbance because the light photons all produce the same-sized effects and the effect of the photons being scattered is enough to smear out any interference effect. Is there not  some  way we can see the electrons without disturbing them? We learned in an earlier chapter that the momentum carried by a “photon” is inversely proportional to its wavelength ( p = h/ l ). Certainly the jolt given to the electron when the photon is scattered 130 Six Easy Pieces 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:01 PM  Page 130 toward our eye depends on the momentum that photon carries. Aha! If we want to disturb the electrons only slightly we should not have lowered the  intensity  of the light; we should have lowered its frequency  (the same as increasing its wavelength). Let us use light of a redder color. We could even use infrared light, or radiowaves (like radar), and “see” where the electron went with the help of some equipment that can “see” light of these longer wavelengths. If we use “gentler” light perhaps we can avoid disturbing the elec- trons so much. Let us try the experiment with longer waves. We shall keep re- peating our experiment, each time with light of a longer wave- length. At ﬁrst, nothing seems to change. The results are the same. Then a terrible thing happens. You remember that when we dis- cussed the microscope we pointed out that, due to the  wave nature of the light, there is a limitation on how close two spots can be and still be seen as two separate spots. This distance is of the order of the wavelength of light. So now, when we make the wavelength longer than the distance between our holes, we see a  big  fuzzy ﬂash when the light is scattered by the electrons. We can no longer tell which hole the electron went through! We just know it went some- where! And it is just with light of this color that we ﬁnd that the jolts given to the electron are small enough so that  P' 12 begins to look like  P 12 —that we begin to get some interference effect. And it is only for wavelengths much longer than the separation of the two holes (when we have no chance at all of telling where the elec- tron went) that the disturbance due to the light gets sufficiently small that we again get the curve  P 12 shown in Fig. 6-3. In our experiment we ﬁnd that it is impossible to arrange the light in such a way that one can tell which hole the electron went through, and at the same time not disturb the pattern. It was sug- gested by Heisenberg that the then-new laws of nature could only be consistent if there were some basic limitation on our experimen- tal capabilities not previously recognized. He proposed, as a general principle, his  uncertainty principle,  which we can state in terms of our experiment as follows: “It is impossible to design an apparatus 131 Quantum Behavior 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:01 PM  Page 131 to determine which hole the electron passes through, that will not at the same time disturb the electrons enough to destroy the inter- ference pattern.” If an apparatus is capable of determining which hole the electron goes through, it  cannot  be so======================================================== talking about the probability that an electron will arrive in a given circumstance. We have implied that in our experimental arrangement (or even in the best possible one) it would be impossible to predict exactly what would happen. We can only predict the odds! This would mean, if it were true, that physics has given up on the problem of trying to predict exactly what will happen in a deﬁnite circumstance. Yes! Physics  has  given up.  We do not know how to predict what would happen in a given circumstance,  and we believe now that it is im- possible, that the only thing that can be predicted is the probability of different events. It must be recognized that this is a retrenchment in our earlier ideal of understanding nature. It may be a backward step, but no one has seen a way to avoid it. We make now a few remarks on a suggestion that has sometimes been made to try to avoid the description we have given: “Perhaps the electron has some kind of internal works—some inner variables— that we do not yet know about. Perhaps that is why we cannot predict what will happen. If we could look more closely at the electron we would be able to tell where it would end up.” So far as we know, that is impossible. We would still be in difficulty. Suppose we were to as- sume that inside the electron there is some kind of machinery that determines where it is going to end up. That machine must  also  de- termine which hole it is going to go through on its way. But we must not forget that what is inside the electron should not be dependent on what  we  do, and in particular upon whether we open or close one of the holes. So if an electron, before it starts, has already made up its mind (a) which hole it is going to use, and (b) where it is going 135 Quantum Behavior 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:01 PM  Page 135 to land, we should ﬁnd  P 1 for those electrons that have chosen hole 1,  P 2 for those that have chosen hole 2,  and necessarily  the sum  P 1 + P 2 for those that arrive through the  two holes. There  seems to be no way around this. But we have veriﬁed experimentally that that is not the case. And no one has ﬁgured a way out of this puzzle. So at the present time we must limit ourselves to computing probabilities. We say “at the present time,” but we suspect very strongly that it is some- thing that will be with us forever—that it is impossible to beat that puzzle—that this is the way nature really  is . The uncertainty principle This is the way Heisenberg stated the uncertainty principle origi- nally: If you make the measurement on any object, and you can determine the  x -component of its momentum with an uncertainty D p , you cannot, at the same time, know its  x -position more accu- rately than  . The uncertainties in the position and mo- mentum at any instant must have their product greater than half the reduced Planck constant. This is a special case of the uncer- tainty principle that was stated above more generally. The more general statement was that one cannot design equipment in any way to determine which of two alternatives is taken, without, at the same time, destroying the pattern of interference. Let us show for one particular case that the kind of relation given by Heisenberg must be true in order to keep from getting into trou- ble. We imagine a modiﬁcation of the experiment of Fig. 6-3, in which the wall with the holes consists of a plate mounted on rollers so that it can move freely up and down (in the  x -direction), as shown in Fig. 6-6. By watching the motion of the plate carefully we can try to tell which hole an electron goes through. Imagine what happens when the detector is placed at  x = 0. We would expect that an electron which passes through hole 1 must be deﬂected downward by the plate to reach the detector. Since the vertical com- ponent of the electron momentum is changed, the plate must recoil with an equal momentum in the opposite direction. The plate will / xp 2 ' $ DD 136 Six Easy Pieces 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:01 PM  Page 136 get an upward kick. If the electron goes through the lower hole, the plate should feel a downward kick. It is clear that for every po- sition of the detector, the momentum received by the plate will have a different value for a traversal via hole 1 than for a traversal via hole 2. So! Without disturbing the electrons  at all,  but just by watching the  plate,  we can tell which path the electron used. Now in order to do this it is necessary to know what the mo- mentum of the screen is, before the electron goes through. So when we measure the momentum after the electron goes by, we can ﬁgure out how much the plate’s momentum has changed. But remember, according to the uncertainty principle we cannot at the same time know the position of the plate with an arbitrary accuracy. But if we do not know exactly  where  the plate is we cannot say precisely where the two holes are. They will be in a different place for every electron that goes======================================================== (aside from gravity). When they come close together, they can “see inside” each other and rearrange their charges, with the result that they have a very strong interaction. The ultimate basis of an interaction be- tween the atoms is  electrical.  Since this force is so enormous, all the plusses and all minuses will normally come together in as in- timate a combination as they can. All things, even ourselves, are made of ﬁne-grained, enormously strongly interacting plus and minus parts, all neatly balanced out. Once in a while, by accident, we may rub off a few minuses or a few plusses (usually it is easier to rub off minuses), and in those circumstances we ﬁnd the force of electricity  unbalanced,  and we can then see the effects of these electrical attractions. To give an idea of how much stronger electricity is than gravita- tion, consider two grains of sand, a millimeter across, thirty meters apart. If the force between them were not balanced, if everything attracted everything else instead of likes repelling, so that there were no cancellations, how much force would there be? There would be a force of  three million tons  between the two! You see, there is very, very  little excess or deﬁcit of the number of negative or positive charges necessary to produce appreciable electrical effects. This is, of course, the reason why you cannot see the difference between an electrically charged and an uncharged thing—so few particles are involved that they hardly make a difference in the weight or size of an object. With this picture the atoms were easier to understand. They were thought to have a “nucleus” at the center, which is positively electrically charged and very massive, and the nucleus is surrounded by a certain number of “electrons” which are very light and nega- tively charged. Now we go a little ahead in our story to remark that in the nucleus itself there were found two kinds of particles, protons and neutrons, almost of the same weight and very heavy. The pro- tons are electrically charged and the neutrons are neutral. If we have an atom with six protons inside its nucleus, and this is surrounded 29 Basic Physics 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:01 PM  Page 29 by six electrons (the negative particles in the ordinary world of mat- ter are all electrons, and these are very light compared with the pro- tons and neutrons which make nuclei), this would be atom number six in the chemical table, and it is called carbon. Atom number eight is called oxygen, etc., because the chemical properties depend upon the electrons on the  outside,  and in fact only upon  how many electrons there are. So the  chemical  properties of a substance depend only on a number, the number of electrons. (The whole list of el- ements of the chemists really could have been called 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, etc. Instead of saying “carbon,” we could say “element six,” meaning six electrons, but of course, when the elements were ﬁrst discovered, it was not known that they could be numbered that way, and sec- ondly, it would make everything look rather complicated. It is bet- ter to have names and symbols for these things, rather than to call everything by number.) More was discovered about the electrical force. The natural in- terpretation of electrical interaction is that two objects simply at- tract each other: plus against minus. However, this was discovered to be an inadequate idea to represent it. A more adequate represen- tation of the situation is to say that the existence of the positive charge, in some sense, distorts, or creates a “condition” in space, so that when we put the negative charge in, it feels a force. This po- tentiality for producing a force is called an  electric ﬁeld.  When we put an electron in an electric ﬁeld, we say it is “pulled.” We then have two rules: (a) charges make a ﬁeld, and (b) charges in ﬁelds have forces on them and move. The reason for this will become clear when we discuss the following phenomena: If we were to charge a body, say a comb, electrically, and then place a charged piece of paper at a distance and move the comb back and forth, the paper will respond by always pointing to the comb. If we shake it faster, it will be discovered that the paper is a little behind,  there is a delay  in the action. (At the ﬁrst stage, when we move the comb rather slowly, we ﬁnd a complication which is  magnetism.  Magnetic inﬂuences have to do with  charges in relative motion,  so magnetic forces and electric forces can really be attributed to one ﬁeld, as two 30 Six Easy Pieces 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:01 PM  Page 30 different aspects of exactly the same thing. A changing electric ﬁeld cannot exist without magnetism.) If we move the charged paper farther out, the delay is greater. Then an interesting thing is ob- served. Although the forces between two charged objects should go inversely as the  square  of the distance, it is found, when we shake a charge, that the inﬂuence extends  very much======================================================== that all reversible machines must lift to  exactly the same height.  Suppose that  B  was really reversible also. The argu- ment that  Y is not higher than  X  is, of course, just as good as it was before, but we can also make our argument the other way around, using the machines in the opposite order, and prove that  X is not higher than Y.  This, then, is a very remarkable observation because it permits us to analyze the height to which different machines are going to lift something  without looking at the interior mechanism. We know at once that if somebody makes an enormously elaborate series of levers that lift three units a certain distance by lowering one unit by one unit distance, and we compare it with a simple lever which does the same thing and is fundamentally reversible, his machine will lift it no higher, but perhaps less high. If his ma- chine is reversible, we also know exactly  how  high it will lift. To summarize: every reversible machine, no matter how it operates, which drops one pound one foot and lifts a three-pound weight al- ways lifts it the same distance,  X.  This is clearly a universal law of great utility. The next question is, of course, what is  X? Suppose we have a reversible machine which is going to lift this distance  X,  three for one. We set up three balls in a rack which does not move, as shown in Fig. 4-2. One ball is held on a stage at a dis- tance one foot above the ground. The machine can lift three balls, lowering one by a distance 1. Now, we have arranged that the plat- form which holds three balls has a ﬂoor and two shelves, exactly spaced at distance  X,  and further, that the rack which holds the balls is spaced at distance  X,  (a). First we roll the balls horizontally 74 Six Easy Pieces 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:01 PM  Page 74 from the rack to the shelves, (b), and we suppose that this takes no energy because we  do not change the height. The reversible machine then operates: it lowers the single ball to the ﬂoor, and it lifts the rack a distance  X,  (c). Now we have ingeniously arranged the rack so that these balls are again even with the platforms. Thus we unload the balls onto the rack, (d); having unloaded the balls, we can restore the machine to its original condition. Now we have three balls on the upper three shelves and one at the bottom. But the strange thing is that, in a certain way of speaking, we have not lifted  two  of them at all because, after all, there were balls on shelves 2 and 3 before. The resulting effect  has been to lift  one ball  a distance 3 X . Now, if 3 X exceeds one foot, then we can  lower  the ball to return the machine to the initial condition, (f), and we can run the apparatus again. Therefore 3 X  cannot exceed one foot, for if 3 X exceeds one foot we can make perpetual motion. Likewise, we can prove that  one foot cannot exceed  3 X,  by making the whole machine run the opposite 75 Conservation of Energy Figure 4-2 A reversible machine. 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:01 PM  Page 75 way, since it is a reversible machine. Therefore 3 X is neither  greater nor less than a foot,  and we discover then, by argument alone, the law that  X =  1 / 3 foot. The generalization is clear: one pound falls a certain distance in operating a reversible machine; then the ma- chine can lift  p  pounds this distance divided by  p.  Another way of putting the result is that three pounds times the height lifted, which in our problem was  X , is equal to one pound times the distance lowered, which is one foot in this case. If we take all the weights and multiply them by the heights at which they are now, above the ﬂoor, let the machine operate, and then multiply all the weights by all the heights again,  there will be no change.  (We have to generalize the example where we moved only one weight to the case where when we lower one, we lift several different ones—but that is easy.) We call the sum of the weights times the heights  gravitational potential energy —the energy which an object has because of its re- lationship in space, relative to the earth. The formula for gravita- tional energy, then, so long as we are not too far from the earth (the force weakens as we go higher) is . (4.3) It is a very beautiful line of reasoning. The only problem is that perhaps it is not true. (After all, nature does not  have  to go along with our reasoning.) For example, perhaps perpetual motion is, in fact, possible. Some of the assumptions may be wrong, or we may have made a mistake in reasoning, so it is always necessary to check. It turns out experimentally,  in fact, to be true. The general name of energy which has to do with location rela- tive to something else is called  potential  energy. In this particular case, of course, we call it  gravitational potential energy.  If it is a ques- tion of electrical forces against which we are working, instead of gravitational forces, if we are “lifting” charges away from other charges with======================================================== changing, but if we could see it a billion times magniﬁed, we would see that from its own point of view it is always changing: molecules are leaving the surface, molecules are coming back. Why do  we  see  no change ? Because just as many molecules are leaving as are coming back! In the long run “nothing happens.” If we then take the top of the vessel off and blow the moist air away, replacing it with dry air, then the number of molecules leaving is just the same as it was before, because this depends on the jiggling of the water, but the number coming back is greatly reduced be- cause there are so many fewer water molecules above the water. Therefore there are more going out than coming in, and the water evaporates. Hence, if you wish to evaporate water turn on the fan! Here is something else: Which molecules leave? When a mole- cule leaves it is due to an accidental, extra accumulation of a little bit more than ordinary energy, which it needs if it is to break away from the attractions of its neighbors. Therefore, since those that leave have more energy than the average, the ones that are left have less  average motion than they had before. So the liquid gradually cools  if it evaporates. Of course, when a molecule of vapor comes from the air to the water below there is a sudden great attraction as the molecule approaches the surface. This speeds up the incoming molecule and results in generation of heat. So when they leave they take away heat; when they come back they generate heat. Of course when there is no net evaporation the result is nothing—the water is not changing temperature. If we blow on the water so as to main- tain a continuous preponderance in the number evaporating, then the water is cooled. Hence, blow on soup to cool it! Of course you should realize that the processes just described are more complicated than we have indicated. Not only does the water go into the air, but also, from time to time, one of the oxygen or nitrogen molecules will come in and “get lost” in the mass of water molecules, and work its way into the water. Thus the air dissolves in the water; oxygen and nitrogen molecules will work their way 12 Six Easy Pieces 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:00 PM  Page 12 into the water and the water will contain air. If we suddenly take the air away from the vessel, then the air molecules will leave more rapidly than they come in, and in doing so will make bubbles. This is very bad for divers, as you may know. Now we go on to another process. In Fig. 1-6 we see, from an atomic point of view, a solid dissolving in water. If we put a crystal of salt in the water, what will happen? Salt is a solid, a crystal, an organized arrangement of “salt atoms.” Figure 1-7 is an illustration of the three-dimensional structure of common salt, sodium chlo- ride. Strictly speaking, the crystal is not made of atoms, but of what we call  ions.  An ion is an atom which either has a few extra electrons or has lost a few electrons. In a salt crystal we ﬁnd chlorine ions (chlorine atoms with an extra electron) and sodium ions (sodium atoms with one electron missing). The ions all stick together by electrical attraction in the solid salt, but when we put them in the water we ﬁnd, because of the attractions of the negative oxygen and positive hydrogen for the ions, that some of the ions jiggle loose. In Fig. 1-6 we see a chlorine ion getting loose, and other atoms ﬂoating in the water in the form of ions. This picture was made with some care. Notice, for example, that the hydrogen ends of the water mol- ecules are more likely to be near the chlorine ion, while near the sodium ion we are more likely to ﬁnd the oxygen end, because the 13 Atoms in Motion Figure 1-6 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:01 PM  Page 13 sodium is positive and the oxygen end of the water is negative, and they attract electrically. Can we tell from this picture whether the salt is  dissolving in  water or  crystallizing out  of water? Of course we cannot  tell, because while some of the atoms are leaving the crystal other atoms are rejoining it. The process is a  dynamic  one, just as in the case of evaporation, and it depends on whether there is more or less salt in the water than the amount needed for equilibrium. By equilibrium we mean that situation in which the rate at which atoms are leaving just matches the rate at which they are coming back. If there is almost no salt in the water, more atoms leave than return, and the salt dissolves. If, on the other hand, there are too many “salt atoms,” more return than leave, and the salt is crystallizing. In passing, we mention that the concept of a  molecule  of a sub- stance is only approximate and exists only for a certain class of sub- stances. It is clear in the case of water that the three atoms are actually stuck together. It is not so clear in the case of sodium chlo- ride in the solid. There is just an arrangement of sodium and chlo- rine ions in a cubic pattern.======================================================== Six Easy Pieces 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:01 PM  Page 112 years we have discovered that all mass is made of tiny particles and that there are several kinds of interactions, such as nuclear forces, etc. None of these nuclear or electrical forces has yet been found to explain gravitation. The quantum-mechanical aspects of nature have not yet been carried over to gravitation. When the scale is so small that we need the quantum effects, the gravitational effects are so weak that the need for a quantum theory of gravitation has not yet developed. On the other hand, for consistency in our physical theories it would be important to see whether Newton’s law mod- iﬁed to Einstein’s law can be further modiﬁed to be consistent with the uncertainty principle. This last modiﬁcation has not yet been completed. 113 The Theory of Gravitation 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:01 PM  Page 113 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:01 PM  Page 114 QUANTUM BEHAVIOR Atomic mechanics In the last few chapters we have treated the essential ideas nec- essary for an understanding of most of the important phenom- ena of light—or electromagnetic radiation in general. (We have left a few special topics for next year. Speciﬁcally, the theory of the index of dense materials and total internal reﬂection.) What we have dealt with is called the “classical theory” of electric waves, which turns out to be a completely adequate description of nature for a large number of effects. We have not had to worry yet about the fact that light energy comes in lumps or “photons.” We would like to take up as our next subject the problem of the behavior of relatively large pieces of matter—their mechanical and thermal properties, for instance. In discussing these, we will ﬁnd that the “classical” (or older) theory fails almost immediately, be- cause matter is really made up of atomic-sized particles. Still, we will deal only with the classical part, because that is the only part that we can understand using the classical mechanics we have been learning. But we shall not be very successful. We shall ﬁnd that in the case of matter, unlike the case of light, we shall be in difficulty relatively soon. We could, of course, continuously skirt away from the atomic effects, but we shall instead interpose here a short ex- cursion in which we will describe the basic ideas of the quantum properties of matter, i.e., the quantum ideas of atomic physics, so 115 6 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:01 PM  Page 115 that you will have some feeling for what it is we are leaving out. For we will have to leave out some important subjects that we can- not avoid coming close to. So we will give now the  introduction  to the subject of quantum mechanics, but will not be able actually to get into the subject until much later. “Quantum mechanics” is the description of the behavior of mat- ter in all its details and, in particular, of the happenings on an atomic scale. Things on a very small scale behave like nothing that you have any direct experience about. They do not behave like waves, they do not behave like particles, they do not behave like clouds, or billiard balls, or weights on springs, or like anything that you have ever seen. Newton thought that light was made up of particles, but then it was discovered, as we have seen here, that it behaves like a wave. Later, however (in the beginning of the twentieth century), it was found that light did indeed sometimes behave like a particle. His- torically, the electron, for example, was thought to behave like a particle, and then it was found that in many respects it behaved like a wave. So it really behaves like neither. Now we have given up. We say: “It is like  neither .” There is one lucky break, however—electrons behave just like light. The quantum behavior of atomic objects (electrons, pro- tons, neutrons, photons, and so on) is the same for all; they are all “particle waves,” or whatever you want to call them. So what we learn about the properties of electrons (which we shall use for our examples) will apply also to all “particles,” including photons of light. The gradual accumulation of information about atomic and small-scale behavior during the ﬁrst quarter of this century, which gave some indications about how small things do behave, produced an increasing confusion which was ﬁnally resolved in 1926 and 1927 by Schrödinger, Heisenberg, and Born. They ﬁnally obtained a consistent description of the behavior of matter on a small scale. We take up the main features of that description in this chapter. 116 Six Easy Pieces 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:01 PM  Page 116 Because atomic behavior is so unlike ordinary experience, it is very difficult to get used to and it appears peculiar and mysterious to everyone, both to the novice and to the experienced physicist. Even the experts do not understand it the way they would like to, and it is perfectly reasonable that they should not, because======================================================== this membrane has an interesting property; if it “discharges” in one place, i.e., if some of the ions were able to move through one place, so that the electric voltage is reduced there, that electrical inﬂuence makes itself felt on the ions in the neighborhood, and it affects the membrane in such a way that it lets the ions through at neighboring points also. This in turn affects it farther along, etc., and so there is a wave of “pen- etrability” of the membrane which runs down the ﬁber when it is “excited” at one end by stepping on the sharp stone. This wave is somewhat analogous to a long sequence of vertical dominoes; if the end one is pushed over, that one pushes the next, etc. Of course this will transmit only one message unless the dominoes are set up again; and similarly in the nerve cell, there are processes which pump the ions slowly out again, to get the nerve ready for the next impulse. So it is that we know what we are doing (or at least where we are). Of course the electrical effects associated with 50 Six Easy Pieces 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:01 PM  Page 50 this nerve impulse can be picked up with electrical instruments, and because there  are  electrical effects, obviously the physics of electrical effects has had a great deal of inﬂuence on understand- ing the phenomenon. The opposite effect is that, from somewhere in the brain, a mes- sage is sent out along a nerve. What happens at the end of the nerve? There the nerve branches out into ﬁne little things, con- nected to a structure near a muscle, called an endplate. For reasons which are not exactly understood, when the impulse reaches the end of the nerve, little packets of a chemical called acetylcholine are shot off (ﬁve or ten molecules at a time) and they affect the muscle ﬁber and make it contract—how simple! What makes a muscle contract? A muscle is a very large number of ﬁbers close to- gether, containing two different substances, myosin and acto- myosin, but the machinery by which the chemical reaction induced by acetylcholine can modify the dimensions of the muscle is not yet known. Thus the fundamental processes in the muscle that make mechanical motions are not known. Biology is such an enormously wide ﬁeld that there are hosts of other problems that we cannot mention at all—problems on how vision works (what the light does in the eye), how hearing works, etc. (The way in which  thinking  works we shall discuss later under psychology.) Now, these things concerning biology which we have just discussed are, from a biological standpoint, really not funda- mental, at the bottom of life, in the sense that even if we under- stood them we still would not understand life itself. To illustrate: the men who study nerves feel their work is very important, because after all you cannot have animals without nerves. But you  can  have life  without nerves. Plants have neither nerves nor muscles, but they are working, they are alive, just the same. So for the fundamental problems of biology we must look deeper; when we do, we discover that all living things have a great many characteristics in common. The most common feature is that they are made of  cells,  within each of which is complex machinery for doing things chemically. 51 The Relation of Physics to Other Sciences 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:01 PM  Page 51 In plant cells, for example, there is machinery for picking up light and generating sucrose, which is consumed in the dark to keep the plant alive. When the plant is eaten the sucrose itself generates in the animal a series of chemical reactions very closely related to pho- tosynthesis (and its opposite effect in the dark) in plants. In the cells of living systems there are many elaborate chemical reactions, in which one compound is changed into another and another. To give some impression of the enormous efforts that have gone into the study of biochemistry, the chart in Fig. 3-1 summarizes our knowledge to date on just one small part of the many series of reactions which occur in cells, perhaps a percent or so of it. Here we see a whole series of molecules which change from one to another in a sequence or cycle of rather small steps. It is called the Krebs cycle, the respiratory cycle. Each of the chemicals and each of the steps is fairly simple, in terms of what change is made in the molecule, but—and this is a centrally important discovery in biochemistry—these changes are  relatively difficult to accomplish in a laboratory.  If we have one substance and another very similar substance, the one does not just turn into the other, because the two forms are usually separated by an energy barrier or “hill.” Con- sider this analogy: If we wanted to take an object from one place to another, at the same level but on the other side of a hill, we could push it over the top, but to do so requires the addition of some en- ergy. Thus most chemical reactions do not occur, because there is what is called an  activation======================================================== consider the time it takes light to go across a proton, 10 –24 sec- ond. If we compare this time with the  age of the universe,  2  ¥ 10 10 years, the answer is 10 –42 . It has about the same number of zeros going off it, so it has been proposed that the gravitational constant is related to the age of the universe. If that were the case, the grav- itational constant would change with time, because as the universe 110 Six Easy Pieces Figure 5-14 The relative strengths of electrical and gravitational interactions between two electrons.  0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:01 PM  Page 110 got older the ratio of the age of the universe to the time which it takes for light to go across a proton would be gradually increasing. Is it possible that the gravitational constant  is  changing with time? Of course the changes would be so small that it is quite difficult to be sure. One test which we can think of is to determine what would have been the effect of the change during the past 10 9 years, which is approximately the age from the earliest life on the earth to now, and one-tenth of the age of the universe. In this time, the gravity constant would have increased by about 10 percent. It turns out that if we consider the structure of the sun—the balance between the weight of its material and the rate at which radiant energy is generated inside it—we can deduce that if the gravity were 10 per- cent stronger, the sun would be much more than 10 percent brighter—by the  sixth power  of the gravity constant! If we calculate what happens to the orbit of the earth when the gravity is changing, we ﬁnd that the earth was then  closer in.  Altogether, the earth would be about 100 degrees centigrade hotter, and all of the water would not have been in the sea, but vapor in the air, so life would not have started in the sea. So we do  not  now believe that the gravity constant is changing with the age of the universe. But such arguments as the one we have just given are not very convincing, and the subject is not completely closed. It is a fact that the force of gravitation is proportional to the mass,  the quantity which is fundamentally a measure of  inertia — of how hard it is to hold something which is going around in a cir- cle. Therefore two objects, one heavy and one light, going around a larger object in the same circle at the same speed because of grav- ity, will stay together because to go in a circle  requires  a force which is stronger for a bigger mass. That is, the gravity is stronger for a given mass in  just the right proportion  so that the two objects will go around together. If one object were inside the other it would stay  inside; it is a perfect balance. Therefore, Gagarin or Titov would ﬁnd things “weightless” inside a spaceship; if they happened 111 The Theory of Gravitation 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:01 PM  Page 111 to let go of a piece of chalk, for example, it would go around the earth in exactly the same way as the whole spaceship, and so it would appear to remain suspended before them in space. It is very interesting that this force is  exactly  proportional to the mass with great precision, because if it were not exactly proportional there would be some effect by which inertia and weight would differ. The absence of such an effect has been checked with great accuracy by an experiment done ﬁrst by Eötvös in 1909 and more recently by Dicke. For all substances tried, the masses and weights are exactly proportional within 1 part in 1,000,000,000, or less. This is a re- markable experiment. Gravity and relativity Another topic deserving discussion is Einstein’s modiﬁcation of Newton’s law of gravitation. In spite of all the excitement it created, Newton’s law of gravitation is not correct! It was modiﬁed by Ein- stein to take into account the theory of relativity. According to Newton, the gravitational effect is instantaneous, that is, if we were to move a mass, we would at once feel a new force because of the new position of that mass; by such means we could send signals at inﬁnite speed. Einstein advanced arguments which suggest that we cannot send signals faster than the speed of light,  so the law of gravi- tation must be wrong. By correcting it to take the delays into ac- count, we have a new law, called Einstein’s law of gravitation. One feature of this new law which is quite easy to understand is this: In the Einstein relativity theory, anything which has  energy  has mass— mass in the sense that it is attracted gravitationally. Even light, which has an energy, has a “mass.” When a light beam, which has energy in it, comes past the sun there is an attraction on it by the sun. Thus the light does not go straight, but is deﬂected. During the eclipse of the sun, for example, the stars which are around the sun should appear displaced from where they would be if the sun were not there, and this has been observed. Finally, let us compare gravitation with other theories. In recent 112======================================================== present quantum mechanics in this reverse fashion—for several reasons which may be apparent in the lectures themselves. However, I think that the experiment in the quantum mechanics part was not completely successful—in large part because I really did not have enough time at the end (I should, for instance, have had three or four more lectures in order to deal more com- pletely with such matters as energy bands and the spatial dependence of amplitudes). Also, I had never presented the subject this way be- fore, so the lack of feedback was particularly serious. I now believe the quantum mechanics should be given at a later time. Maybe I’ll have a chance to do it again someday. Then I’ll do it right. The reason there are no lectures on how to solve problems is be- cause there were recitation sections. Although I did put in three lectures in the ﬁrst year on how to solve problems, they are not in- cluded here. Also there was a lecture on inertial guidance which certainly belongs after the lecture on rotating systems, but which was, unfortunately, omitted. The ﬁfth and sixth lectures are actually due to Matthew Sands, as I was out of town. The question, of course, is how well this experiment has suc- ceeded. My own point of view—which, however, does not seem to be shared by most of the people who worked with the students— is pessimistic. I don’t think I did very well by the students. When I look at the way the majority of the students handled the problems on the examinations, I think that the system is a failure. Of course, my friends point out to me that there were one or two dozen stu- dents who—very surprisingly—understood almost everything in all of the lectures, and who were quite active in working with the material and worrying about the many points in an excited and in- xxviii Feynman’s Preface 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:00 PM  Page xxviii terested way. These people have now, I believe, a ﬁrst-rate back- ground in physics—and they are, after all, the ones I was trying to get at. But then, “The power of instruction is seldom of much effi- cacy except in those happy dispositions where it is almost super- ﬂuous.” (Gibbon) Still, I didn’t want to leave any student completely behind, as perhaps I did. I think one way we could help the students more would be by putting more hard work into developing a set of prob- lems which would elucidate some of the ideas in the lectures. Prob- lems give a good opportunity to ﬁll out the material of the lectures and make more realistic, more complete, and more settled in the mind the ideas that have been exposed. I think, however, that there isn’t any solution to this problem of education other than to realize that the best teaching can be done only when there is a direct individual relationship between a stu- dent and a good teacher—a situation in which the student discusses the ideas, thinks about the things, and talks about the things. It’s impossible to learn very much by simply sitting in a lecture, or even by simply doing problems that are assigned. But in our modern times we have so many students to teach that we have to try to ﬁnd some substitute for the ideal. Perhaps my lectures can make some contribution. Perhaps in some small place where there are individ- ual teachers and students, they may get some inspiration or some ideas from the lectures. Perhaps they will have fun thinking them through—or going on to develop some of the ideas further. June 1963 Richard P.

This is not necessarily the case of course, but that is what every professor in every subject assumes! If you are going to be a physicist, you will have a lot to study: two hundred years of the most rapidly devel- oping ﬁeld of knowledge that there is. So much knowledge, in fact, that you might think that you cannot learn all of it in four years, and truly you cannot; you will have to go to graduate school too! Surprisingly enough, in spite of the tremendous amount of work that has been done for all this time it is possible to condense the enormous mass of results to a large extent—that is, to ﬁnd  laws which summarize all our knowledge. Even so, the laws are so hard to grasp that it is unfair to you to start exploring this tremendous subject without some kind of map or outline of the relationship of one part of the subject of science to another. Following these pre- liminary remarks, the ﬁrst three chapters will therefore outline the relation of physics to the rest of the sciences, the relations of the sciences to each other, and the meaning of science, to help us de- velop a “feel” for the subject. You might ask why we cannot teach physics by just giving the basic laws on page one and then showing how======================================================== remained close to the real and often grubby world of experimental results. Nobody who watched the elderly Feynman elucidate the cause of the Chal- lenger space shuttle disaster by dipping an elastic band in ice water could doubt that here was both a showman and a very practical thinker. Initially, Feynman made a name for himself from his work on the theory of subatomic particles, speciﬁcally the topic known as quan- tum electrodynamics or QED. In fact, the quantum theory began with this topic. In 1900, the German physicist Max Planck pro- posed that light and other electromagnetic radiation, which had hitherto been regarded as waves, paradoxically behaved like tiny packets of energy, or “quanta,” when interacting with matter. These particular quanta became known as photons. By the early 1930s the architects of the new quantum mechanics had worked out a mathematical scheme to describe the emission and absorption of photons by electrically charged particles such as electrons. Although this early formulation of QED enjoyed some limited success, the theory was clearly ﬂawed. In many cases calculations gave incon- sistent and even inﬁnite answers to well-posed physical questions. x Introduction 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:00 PM  Page x It was to the problem of constructing a consistent theory of QED that the young Feynman turned his attention in the late 1940s. To place QED on a sound basis it was necessary to make the theory consistent not only with the principles of quantum mechan- ics but with those of the special theory of relativity too. These two theories come with their own distinctive mathematical machinery, complicated systems of equations that can indeed be combined and reconciled to yield a satisfactory description of QED. Doing this was a tough undertaking, requiring a high degree of mathematical skill, and was the approach followed by Feynman’s contemporaries. Feynman himself, however, took a radically different route—so rad- ical, in fact, that he was more or less able to write down the answers straightaway without using any mathematics! To aid this extraordinary feat of intuition, Feynman invented a simple system of eponymous diagrams. Feynman diagrams are a symbolic but powerfully heuristic way of picturing what is going on when electrons, photons, and other particles interact with each other. These days Feynman diagrams are a routine aid to calcula- tion, but in the early 1950s they marked a startling departure from the traditional way of doing theoretical physics. The particular problem of constructing a consistent theory of quantum electrodynamics, although it was a milestone in the de- velopment of physics, was just the start. It was to deﬁne a distinctive Feynman style, a style destined to produce a string of important results from a broad range of topics in physical science. The Feyn- man style can best be described as a mixture of reverence and dis- respect for received wisdom. Physics is an exact science, and the existing body of knowledge, while incomplete, can’t simply be shrugged aside. Feynman ac- quired a formidable grasp of the accepted principles of physics at a very young age, and he chose to work almost entirely on conven- tional problems. He was not the sort of genius to beaver away in isolation in a backwater of the discipline and to stumble across the profoundly new. His special talent was to approach essentially mainstream topics in an idiosyncratic way. This meant eschewing xi Introduction 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:00 PM  Page xi existing formalisms and developing his own highly intuitive ap- proach. Whereas most theoretical physicists rely on careful mathe- matical calculation to provide a guide and a crutch to take them into unfamiliar territory, Feynman’s attitude was almost cavalier. You get the impression that he could read nature like a book and simply report on what he found, without the tedium of complex analysis. Indeed, in pursuing his interests in this manner Feynman dis- played a healthy contempt for rigorous formalisms. It is hard to convey the depth of genius that is necessary to work like this. The- oretical physics is one of the toughest intellectual exercises, com- bining abstract concepts that defy visualization with extreme mathematical complexity. Only by adopting the highest standards of mental discipline can most physicists make progress. Yet Feyn- man appeared to ride roughshod over this strict code of practice and pluck new results like ready-made fruit from the Tree of Knowledge. The Feynman style owed a great deal to the personality of the man. In his professional and private life he seemed to treat the world as a hugely entertaining game. The physical universe pre- sented him with a fascinating series of puzzles and challenges, and so did his social environment. A lifelong prankster, he treated au- thority and the academic establishment with the same sort of dis- respect he showed for stuffy mathematical formalism. Never======================================================== with the forms actually exhibited by crystals as they occur in nature. The angles between the various “faces” of a crystal agree, within seconds of arc, with angles deduced on the assump- tion that a crystal is made of many “layers” of atoms. Everything is made of atoms.  That is the key hypothesis. The most important hypothesis in all of biology, for example, is that  every- thing that animals do, atoms do.  In other words,  there is nothing that living things do that cannot be understood from the point of view that they are made of atoms acting according to the laws of physics.  This was not known from the beginning: it took some experimenting and theorizing to suggest this hypothesis, but now it is accepted, and it is the most useful theory for producing new ideas in the ﬁeld of biology. If a piece of steel or a piece of salt, consisting of atoms one next to the other, can have such interesting properties; if water—which is nothing but these little blobs, mile upon mile of the same thing over the earth—can form waves and foam, and make rushing noises and strange patterns as it runs over cement; if all of this, all the life of a stream of water, can be nothing but a pile of atoms,  how much more is possible ? If instead of arranging the atoms in some deﬁnite pattern, again and again repeated, on and on, or even forming little lumps of complexity like the odor of violets, we make an arrange- ment which is  always different  from place to place, with different kinds of atoms arranged in many ways, continually changing, not repeating, how much more marvelously is it possible that this thing might behave? Is it possible that that “thing” walking back and forth in front of you, talking to you, is a great glob of these atoms 20 Six Easy Pieces 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:01 PM  Page 20 in a very complex arrangement, such that the sheer complexity of it staggers the imagination as to what it can do? When we say we are a pile of atoms, we do not mean we are  merely  a pile of atoms, because a pile of atoms which is not repeated from one to the other might well have the possibilities which you see before you in the mirror. 21 Atoms in Motion 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:01 PM  Page 21 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:01 PM  Page 22 BASIC PHYSICS Introduction In this chapter, we shall examine the most fundamental ideas that we have about physics—the nature of things as we see them at the present time. We shall not discuss the history of how we know that all these ideas are true; you will learn these details in due time. The things with which we concern ourselves in science appear in myriad forms, and with a multitude of attributes. For example, if we stand on the shore and look at the sea, we see the water, the waves breaking, the foam, the sloshing motion of the water, the sound, the air, the winds and the clouds, the sun and the blue sky, and light; there is sand and there are rocks of various hardness and permanence, color and texture. There are animals and seaweed, hunger and disease, and the observer on the beach; there may be even happiness and thought. Any other spot in nature has a similar variety of things and inﬂuences. It is always as complicated as that, no matter where it is. Curiosity demands that we ask questions, that we try to put things together and try to understand this mul- titude of aspects as perhaps resulting from the action of a relatively small number of elemental things and forces acting in an inﬁnite variety of combinations. For example: Is the sand other than the rocks? That is, is the sand perhaps nothing but a great number of very tiny stones? Is the moon a great rock? If we understood rocks, would we  also understand the 23 2 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:01 PM  Page 23 sand and the moon? Is the wind a sloshing of the air analogous to the sloshing motion of the water in the sea? What common features do different movements have? What is common to different kinds of sound? How many different colors are there? And so on. In this way we try gradually to analyze all things, to put together things which at ﬁrst sight look different, with the hope that we may be able to  reduce  the number of  different  things and thereby under- stand them better. A few hundred years ago, a method was devised to ﬁnd partial answers to such questions.  Observation, reason,  and  experiment make up what we call the  scientiﬁc method.  We shall have to limit ourselves to a bare description of our basic view of what is some- times called  fundamental physics,  or fundamental ideas which have arisen from the application of the scientiﬁc method. What do we mean by “understanding” something? We can imag- ine that this complicated array of moving things which constitutes “the world” is something like a great chess game being played by the gods, and we are observers of the game. We do not know what the rules of the game are; all we are allowed to do is to  watch  the playing.======================================================== electron apparatus we add a very strong light source, placed behind the wall and between the two holes, as shown in Fig. 6-4. We know that electric charges scatter light. So when an electron passes, however it does pass, on its way to the detector, it will scatter some light to our eye, and we can see  where the electron goes. If, for instance, an electron were to take the path via hole 2 that is sketched in Fig. 6-4, we should see a ﬂash of light coming from the vicinity of the place marked  A  in the ﬁg- ure. If an electron passes through hole 1 we would expect to see a ﬂash from the vicinity of the upper hole. If it should happen that we get light from both places  at the same time,  becausethe  electron divides in half . . . Let us just do the experiment! Here is what we see:  every  time that we hear a “click” from our electron detector (at the backstop), we  also see  a ﬂash of light  either near hole 1  or  near hole 2, but  never  both at once! And we observe the same result no matter where we put the detector. From this ob- servation we conclude that when we look at the electrons we ﬁnd that the electrons go either through one hole or the other. Experi- mentally, Proposition A is necessarily true. 127 Quantum Behavior 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:01 PM  Page 127 What, then, is wrong with our argument  against  Proposition A? Why  isn’t P 12 just equal to  P 1 +  P 2 ? Back to experiment! Let us keep track of the electrons and ﬁnd out what they are doing. For each position ( x -location) of the detector we will count the electrons that arrive and  also  keep track of which hole they went through, by watching for the ﬂashes. We can keep track of things this way: whenever we hear a “click” we will put a count in Column 1 if we see the ﬂash near hole 1, and if we see the ﬂash near hole 2, we will record a count in Column 2. Every electron which arrives is recorded in one of two classes: those which come through 1 and those which come through 2. From the number recorded in Col- umn 1 we get the probability  P' 1 that an electron will arrive at the detector via hole 1; and from the number recorded in Column 2 we get  P' 2 , the probability that an electron will arrive at the detector via hole 2. If we now repeat such a measurement for many values of  x , we get the curves for  P' 1 and  P' 2 shown in part (b) of Fig. 6- 4. Well, that is not too surprising! We get for  P' 1 something quite similar to what we got before for  P , by blocking off hole 2; and  P' 2 is similar to what we got by blocking hole 1. So there is  not  any complicated business like going through both holes. When we 128 Six Easy Pieces Figure 6-4 A different electron experiment. 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:01 PM  Page 128 watch them, the electrons come through just as we would expect them to come through. Whether the holes are closed or open, those which we see come through hole 1 are distributed in the same way whether hole 2 is open or closed. But wait! What do we have  now  for the  total  probability, the probability that an electron will arrive at the detector by any route? We already have that information. We just pretend that we never looked at the light ﬂashes, and we lump together the detector clicks which we have separated into the two columns. We  must  just  add the numbers. For the probability that an electron will arrive at the backstop by passing through  either  hole, we do ﬁnd  P' 12 =  P' 1 +  P' 2 . That is, although we succeeded in watching which hole our elec- trons come through, we no longer get the old interference curve P 12 , but a new one,  P' 12 , showing no interference! If we turn out the light  P 12 is restored. We must conclude that  when we look at the electrons  the distri- bution of them on the screen is different than when we do not look. Perhaps it is turning on our light source that disturbs things? It must be that the electrons are very delicate, and the light, when it scatters off the electrons, gives them a jolt that changes their mo- tion. We know that the electric ﬁeld of the light acting on a charge will exert a force on it. So perhaps we  should  expect the motion to be changed. Anyway, the light exerts a big inﬂuence on the elec- trons. By trying to “watch” the electrons we have changed their mo- tions. That is, the jolt given to the electron when the photon is scattered by it is such as to change the electron’s motion enough so that if it  might  have gone to where  P 12 was at a maximum, it will instead land where  P 12 was a minimum; that is why we no longer see the wavy interference effects. You may be thinking: “Don’t use such a bright source! Turn the brightness down! The light waves will then be weaker and will not disturb the electrons so much. Surely, by making the light dimmer and dimmer, eventually the wave will be weak enough that it will have a negligible effect.” OK. Let’s try it. The ﬁrst thing we observe is that the ﬂash of light scattered from the
