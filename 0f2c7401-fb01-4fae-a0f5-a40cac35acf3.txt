 that these new  universes might have different laws of physics – and that, moreover,  those laws would be affected by conditions in the parent universe. In  particular, intelligent beings in the parent universe could influence the  black holes to produce further universes with person-friendly laws of  physics. But there is a problem with explanations of this type (known  as ‘evolutionary cosmologies’): how many universes were there to  begin with? If there were infinitely many, then we are left with the  problem of how to count them – and the mere fact that each  astrophysicist-bearing universe would give rise to several others need  not meaningfully increase the  proportion  of such universes in the total.  If there was no first universe or universes, but the whole ensemble has  already existed for an infinite time, then the theory has an infinite- regress problem. For then, as the cosmologist Frank Tipler has pointed  out, the entire collection must have settled into its equilibrium state  ‘an infinite time ago’, which would mean that the evolution that  brought about that equilibrium – the very process that is supposed to  explain the fine-tuning –  never happened  (just as the lost puppy is  nowhere ). If there was initially only one universe, or a finite number,  179 A Window on Infinity then we are left with the fine-tuning problem for the original universe(s):  did they contain astrophysicists? Presumably not; but if the original  universes produced an enormous chain of descendants until one, by  chance, contains astrophysicists, then that still does not answer the  question of why the entire system – now operating under a single law  of physics in which the apparent ‘constants’ are varying according    to laws of nature – permits this ultimately astrophysicist-friendly  mechanism to happen. And there would be no anthropic explanation  for  that  coincidence. Smolin’s theory does the right thing: it proposes an overarching  framework for the ensemble of universes, and some physical connec- tions between them. But the explanation connects only universes and  their ‘parent’ universes, which is insufficient. So it does not work. But now suppose we also tell a story about the reality that connects  all these universes and gives a preferred physical meaning to one way  of labelling them. Here is one. A girl called Lyra, who was born in  universe 1, discovers a device that can move her to other universes. It  also keeps her alive inside a small sphere of life support, even in universes  whose laws of physics do not otherwise support life. So long as she  holds down a certain button on the device, she moves from universe to  universe,  in a fixed order , at intervals of exactly one minute. As soon  as she lets go, she returns to her home universe. Let us label the universes  1, 2, 3 and so on, in the order in which the device visits them.  Sometimes Lyra also takes with her a measuring instrument that  measures the constant  D , and another that measures – rather like the  SETI  project, only much faster and more reliably – whether there are  astrophysicists in the universe. She is hoping to test the predictions of  the anthropic principle. But she can only ever visit a finite number of universes, and she has  no way of telling whether those are representative of the whole infinite  set. However, the device does have a second setting. On that setting, it  takes Lyra to universe 2 for one minute, then universe 3 for  half  a  minute, universe 4 for a quarter of a minute and so on. If she has not  released the button by the time two minutes are up, she will have visited  every universe in the infinite set, which in this story means every universe  in existence. The device then returns her automatically to universe 1. If  she presses it again, her journey begins again with universe 2. 180 the beginning of infinity Most of the universes flash by too fast for Lyra to see. But her  measuring instruments are not subject to the limitations of human  senses – nor to  our  world’s laws of physics. After they are switched  on, their displays show a running average of the values from all the  universes they have been in, regardless of how much time they spent  in each. So, for instance, if the even-numbered universes have astro- physicists and the odd-numbered ones do not, then at the end of a  two-minute journey through all the universes her  SETI -like instrument  will be displaying 0.5. So in that multiverse it  is  meaningful to say that  half the universes have astrophysicists. Using a universe-travelling device that visited the same universes in  a different order, one would obtain a different value for that proportion.  But , suppose that the laws of physics permit visiting them in only one  order (rather as our own laws of physics normally allow us to be at  different  times  only in one particular order). Since there is now only  one way for measuring instruments to respond to averages, typical  values and so

 nation merely has one more legislator to feed than planned.  The real problem is that this apportionment is no longer representative:  85 per cent of eleven is not 8.5 but 9.35. So the large state, with only  eight seats, is in fact short of its quota by well over one seat. My rule  under-represents 85 per cent of the population. Because we  intended   to allocate ten seats, the exact quotas necessarily add up to ten; but  the rounded ones add up to eleven. And if there are going to be eleven  seats in the House, the principle of representative government – and  the Constitution – requires each state to receive its fair share of those,  not of the ten that we merely intended.  Again, many ‘why don’t they just . . . ?’ ideas spring to mind. Why  don’t they just create three additional seats and give them to the large  state, thus bringing the allocation within the quota? (Curious readers  328 the beginning of infinity may check that no fewer than three additional seats are needed to  achieve this.) Alternatively, why don’t they just transfer a seat from  one of the small states to the large state? Perhaps it should be from the  state with the smallest population, so as to disadvantage as few people  as possible. That would not only bring all the allocations within the  quota, but also restore the number of seats to the originally intended  ten. Such strategies are known as  reallocation schemes . They are indeed  capable of staying within the quota. So, what is wrong with them? In  the jargon of the subject, the answer is  apportionment paradoxes  – or,  in ordinary language,  unfairness  and  irrationality .  For example, the last reallocation scheme that I described is unfair  by being biased against the inhabitants of the least populous state.  They bear the whole cost of correcting the rounding errors. On this  occasion their representation has been rounded down to zero. Yet, in  the sense of minimizing the deviation from the quotas, the apportion- ment is almost perfectly fair: previously, 85 per cent of the population  were well outside the quota, and now all are within it and 95 per cent  are at the closest whole numbers to their quotas. It is true that 5 per  cent now have no representatives – so they will not be able to vote in  congressional elections at all – but that still leaves them within the  quota, and indeed only slightly further from their exact quota than  they were. (The numbers zero and one are almost equidistant from the  quota of just over one half.) Nevertheless, because those 5 per cent  have been completely disenfranchised, most advocates of representative  government would regard this outcome as much less representative  than it was before.  That must mean that the ‘minimum total deviation from quota’ is  not the right measure of representativeness. But what is the right  measure? What is the right trade-off between being slightly unfair to  many people and very unfair to a few people? The Founding Fathers  were aware that different conceptions of fairness, or representativeness,  could conflict. For example, one of their justifications for democracy  was that govern  ment was not legitimate unless everyone who was  subject to the law had a representative, of equal power, among the  lawmakers. This was expressed in their slogan ‘No taxation without  representation’. Another of their aspirations was to abolish  privilege :  329 Choices they wanted the system of government to have no built-in bias. Hence  the requirement of proportional allocation. Since these two aspirations  can conflict, the Constitution contains a clause that explicitly adjudicates  between them: ‘Each State shall have at least one Representative.’ This  favours the principle of representative government in the no-taxation- without-representation sense over the same principle in the abolish- privilege sense. Another concept that frequently appeared in the Founding Fathers’  arguments for representative government was ‘the will of the people’.  Governments are supposed to enact it. But that is a source of further  inconsistencies. For in elections, only the will of  voters  counts, and not  all of ‘the people’ are voters. At the time, voters were a fairly small  minority: only free male citizens over the age of twenty-one. To address  this point, the ‘Numbers’ referred to in the Constitution constituted  the whole population of a state, including non-voters such as women,  children, immigrants and slaves. In this way the Constitution attempted  to treat the  population  equally by treating  voters  unequally. So voters in states with a higher proportion of non-voters were  allocated more representatives per capita.  This had the perverse effect  that in the states where the voters were already the most privileged  within  the state (i.e. where they were an exceptionally small minority),  they now received an additional privilege relative to voters in other  states: they were allocated more representation in

 what to want , what to  strive for. The human mind seeks explanations; and now that we  know how to find them, we are not going to stop voluntarily. Here  is another misconception in the Garden of Eden myth: that the  supposed unproblematic state would be a  good  state to be in. Some  theologians have denied this, and I agree with them: an unproblematic  state is a state without creative thought. Its other name is death. All those kinds of problem (survival-related, progress-related, moral,  and sheer-curiosity-driven problems) are connected. We can, for in    - stance, expect that our ability to cope with existential threats will  64 the beginning of infinity continue to depend on knowledge that was originally created for its  own sake. And we can expect disagreements about goals and values  always to exist, because, among other reasons, moral explanations  depend partly on facts about the physical world. For instance, the  moral stances in the Principle of Mediocrity and the Spaceship Earth  idea depend on the physical world not being explicable in the sense  that I have argued it must be. Nor will we ever run out of problems. The deeper an explanation  is, the more new problems it creates. That must be so, if only because  there can be no such thing as an ultimate explanation: just as ‘the gods  did it’ is always a bad explanation, so any other purported foundation  of all explanations must be bad too. It must be easily variable because  it cannot answer the question: why that foundation and not another?  Nothing can be explained only in terms of itself. That holds for  philosophy just as it does for science, and in particular it holds for  moral  philosophy: no utopia is possible, but only because our values  and our objectives can continue to improve indefinitely.  Thus fallibilism alone rather understates the error-prone nature of  knowledge-creation. Knowledge-creation is not only  subject  to error:  errors are common, and significant, and always will be, and correcting  them will always reveal further and better problems. And so the maxim  that I suggested should be carved in stone, namely ‘The Earth’s  biosphere is  incapable  of supporting human life’ is actually a special  case of a much more general truth, namely that, for people,  problems  are inevitable . So let us carve  that  in stone: It is inevitable that we face problems, but no particular problem is  inevitable. We survive, and thrive, by solving each problem as it comes  PROBLEMS ARE INEVITABLE PROBLEMS ARE INEVITABLE 65 The Spark up. And, since the human ability to transform nature is limited only  by the laws of physics, none of the endless stream of problems will  ever constitute an impassable barrier. So a complementary and equally  important truth about people and the physical world is that  problems  are soluble.  By ‘soluble’ I mean that the right knowledge would solve  them. It is not, of course, that we can possess knowledge just by wishing  for it; but it is in principle accessible to us. So let us carve that in    stone too: That  progress  is both possible and desirable is perhaps the  quintessential idea of the Enlightenment. It motivates all traditions of  criticism, as well as the principle of seeking good explanations. But it  can be interpreted in two almost opposite ways, both of which,  confusingly, are known as ‘perfectibility’. One is that humans, or human  societies, are capable of attaining a state of supposed perfection – such  as the Buddhist or Hindu ‘nirvana’, or various political utopias. The  other is that every attainable state can be indefinitely improved.  Fallibilism rules out that first position in favour of the second. Neither  the human condition in particular nor our explanatory knowledge in  general will ever be perfect, nor even approximately perfect. We shall  always be at the  beginning  of infinity. These two interpretations of human progress and perfectibility have  historically inspired two broad branches of the Enlightenment which,  though they share attributes such as their rejection of authority, are so  different in important respects in that it is most unfortunate that they  share the same name. The utopian ‘Enlightenment’ is sometimes called  the Continental (European) Enlightenment to distinguish it from the  more fallibilist British Enlightenment, which began a little earlier and  PROBLEMS ARE SOLUBLE PROBLEMS ARE SOLUBLE PROBLEMS ARE SOLUBLE 66 the beginning of infinity took a very different course. (See, for instance, the historian Roy  Porter’s book  Enlightenment .) In my terminology, the Continental  Enlightenment understood that problems are soluble but not that they  are inevitable, while the British Enlightenment understood both equally.  Note that this is a classification of ideas, not of nations or even  individual thinkers: not all Enlightenment thinkers belong wholly to  one branch or the other; nor were all thinkers of the respective  Enlighten  ments born in the

 the idea of creativity is still rather confused by various mis  - conceptions. Empiricism miscasts science as an automatic, non-creative  process. And art, though acknowledged as ‘creative’, has often been  seen as the antithesis of science, and hence irrational, random, in    - explicable – and hence unjudgeable, and non-objective. But if beauty  is  objective, then a new work of art, like a newly discovered law of  nature or mathematical theorem, adds something irreducibly new to  the world.  We stare at the red traffic light because doing so will allow us to  continue our journey with the least possible delay. An animal can be  359 Why are Flowers Beautiful?  attracted towards another animal in order to mate with it, or to eat it.  Once the predator has taken a bite, it is attracted to take another –  unless the bite tastes bad, in which case it will be repelled. So there we  have a literal matter of taste. And that matter of taste is indeed caused  by the laws of physics in the form of the laws of chemistry and  biochemistry. We can guess that there is no higher-level explanation  of the resulting behaviour than the zoological level, because the be    - haviour is predictable. It is repetitive, and where it is not repetitive it  is random.  Art does not consist of repetition. But in human tastes there can be  genuine novelty. Because we are universal explainers, we are not simply  obeying our genes. For instance, humans often act in ways that are  contrary to any preferences that might plausibly have been built into  our genes. People fast – sometimes for aesthetic reasons. Some abstain  from sex. People act in very diverse ways for religious reasons or for  any number of other reasons, philosophical or scientific, practical or  whimsical. We have an inborn aversion to heights and to falling, yet  people go skydiving – not in spite of this feeling, but because of it. It  is that very feeling of inborn aversion that humans can reinterpret into  a larger picture which to them is attractive – they want more of it; they  want to appreciate it more deeply. To a skydiver, the vista from which  we were born to recoil is beautiful. The whole activity of skydiving is  beautiful, and part of that beauty is in the very sensations that evolved  to deter us from trying it. The conclusion is inescapable: that attraction  is not inborn, just as the contents of a newly discovered law of physics  or mathematical theorem are not inborn.  Could it be purely cultural? We pursue beauty as well as truth, and  in both cases we can be fooled. Perhaps we see a face as beautiful  because it really is, or perhaps it is only because of a combination of  our genes and our culture. A beetle is attracted to another beetle that  you and I may see as hideous. But not if you are an entomologist.  People can  learn  to see many things as beautiful or ugly. But, there  again, people can also learn to see false scientific theories as true, and  true ones as false, yet there is such a thing as objective scientific truth.  So that still does not tell us whether there is such a thing as objective  beauty. 360 the beginning of infinity Now, why is a flower the shape that it is? Because the relevant genes  evolved to make it attractive to insects. Why would they do this?  Because when insects visit a flower they are dusted with pollen, which  they then deposit in other flowers of the same species, and so the    genes in the DNA in that pollen are spread far and wide. This is the  reproductive mechanism that flowering plants evolved and which most  still use today: before there were insects, there were no flowers on  Earth. But the mechanism could work only because insects, at the    same time, evolved genes that attracted them to flowers. Why did    they? Because flowers provide nectar, which is food. Just as there is  co-evolution between the genes to coordinate mating behaviours in  males and females of the same species, so genes for making flowers  and giving them their shapes and colours co-evolved with genes in  insects for recognizing flowers with the best nectar.  During that biological co-evolution, just as in the history of art,  criteria  evolved, and  means of meeting those criteria  co-evolved with  them. That is what gave flowers the knowledge of how to attract insects,  and insects the knowledge of how to recognize those flowers and the  propensity to fly towards them. But what is surprising is that these    same flowers  also attract humans . This is so familiar a fact that it is hard to see how amazing it is. But  think of all the countless hideous animals in nature, and think also that  all of them who find their mates by sight have evolved to find that  appearance attractive. And therefore it is not surprising that we do not.  With predators and prey there is a similar co-evolution, but in a  361 Why are Flowers Beautiful?  competitive sense rather than a cooperative one: each has genes that  evolved to enable it to recognize
========================================================
 policy is bad, and to remove them without violence if they are. Just as  the institutions of science are structured so as to avoid entrenching  theories, but instead to expose them to criticism and testing, so political  institutions should not make it hard to oppose rulers and policies,  non-violently, and should embody traditions of peaceful, critical dis-  cussion of them and of the institutions themselves and everything else.  Thus, systems of government are to be judged not for their prophetic  ability to choose and install good leaders and policies, but for their  ability to remove bad ones that are already there.  That entire stance is fallibilism in action. It  assumes  that rulers and  policies are always going to be flawed – that problems are inevitable.  But it also assumes that improving upon them is possible: problems  are soluble. The ideal towards which this is working is not that nothing  212 the beginning of infinity unexpected will go wrong, but that when it does it will be an opportun- ity for further progress. Why would anyone want to make the leaders and policies that they  themselves favour more vulnerable to removal? Indeed, let me first  ask:  why would anyone want to replace bad leaders and policies at  all?  That question may seem absurd, but perhaps it is absurd only from  the perspective of a civilization that takes progress for granted. If we  did not expect progress, why should we expect the new leader or policy,  chosen by whatever method, to be any better than the old? On the  contrary, we should then expect any changes on average to do as much  harm as good. And then the precautionary principle advises, ‘Better  the devil you know than the devil you don’t.’ There is a closed loop of  ideas here: on the assumption that knowledge is not going to grow,  the precautionary principle is true; and on the assumption that the  precautionary principle is true, we cannot afford to allow knowledge  to grow. Unless a society is expecting its own future choices to be better  than its present ones, it will strive to make its present policies and  institutions as immutable as possible. Therefore Popper’s criterion can  be met only by societies that expect their knowledge to grow – and to  grow unpredictably. And, further, they are expecting that if it did grow,  that would help .  This expectation is what I call optimism, and I can state it, in its  most general form, thus: The Principle of Optimism All evils are caused by insufficient knowledge. Optimism is, in the first instance, a way of explaining failure, not  prophesying success. It says that there is no fundamental barrier, no  law of nature or supernatural decree, preventing progress. Whenever  we try to improve things and fail, it is not because the spiteful (or  unfathomably benevolent) gods are thwarting us or punishing us for  trying, or because we have reached a limit on the capacity of reason  to make improvements, or because it is best that we fail, but always  because we did not know enough, in time. But optimism is also a stance  towards the future, because nearly all failures, and nearly all successes,  are yet to come. 213 Optimism Optimism follows from the explicability of the physical world, as I  explained in Chapter 3. If something is permitted by the laws of physics,  then the only thing that can prevent it from being technologically  possible is not knowing how. Optimism also assumes that none of the  prohibitions  imposed by the laws of physics are necessarily  evils . So,  for instance, the lack of the impossible knowledge of prophecy is not  an insuperable obstacle to progress. Nor are insoluble mathematical  problems, as I explained in Chapter 8.  That means that in the long run there are no insuperable evils, and  in the short run the only insuperable evils are parochial ones. There  can be no such thing as a disease for which it is impossible to discover  a cure, other than certain types of brain damage – those that have  dissipated the knowledge that constitutes the patient’s personality. For  a sick person is a physical object, and the task of transforming this  object into the same person in good health is one that no law of physics  rules out. Hence there is a way of achieving such a transformation –  that is to say, a cure. It is only a matter of knowing how. If we do not,  for the moment, know how to eliminate a particular evil, or we know  in theory but do not yet have enough time or resources (i.e. wealth),  then, even so, it is universally true that  either  the laws of physics forbid  eliminating it in a given time with the available resources  or  there is a  way of eliminating it in the time and with those resources. The same must hold, equally trivially, for the evil of death – that is  to say, the deaths of human beings from disease or old age. This problem  has a tremendous resonance in every culture – in its literature, its values,  its objectives great and small. It also has an almost

 the moon project would require a  vehicle ‘made of new metal alloys, some of which have not yet been  invented, capable of standing heat and stresses several times more than  have ever been experienced, fitted together with a precision better than  the finest watch, carrying all the equipment needed for propulsion,  guidance, control, communications, food and survival’. Those were the  known problems, which would require as-yet-unknown knowledge.  That this was ‘on an untried mission, to an unknown celestial body’  referred to the unknown problems that made the probabilities, and the  outcomes, profoundly unknowable. Yet none of that prevented rational  people from forming the expectation that the mission could succeed.  This expectation was not a judgement of probability: until far into the  project, no one could predict that, because it depended on solutions  216 the beginning of infinity not yet discovered to problems not yet known. When people were  being persuaded to work on the project – and to vote for it, and so on  – they were being persuaded that our being confined to one planet    was an evil, that exploring the universe was a good, that the Earth’s  gravitational field was not a barrier but merely a problem, and that  overcoming it and all the other problems involved in the project was  only a matter of knowing how, and that the nature of the problems  made that moment the right one to try to solve them. Probabilities and  prophecies were not needed in that argument. Pessimism has been endemic in almost every society throughout  history. It has taken the form of the precautionary principle, and of  ‘who should rule?’ political philosophies and all sorts of other demands  for prophecy, and of despair in the power of creativity, and of the  misinterpretation of problems as insuperable barriers. Yet there have  always been a few individuals who see obstacles as problems, and see  problems as soluble. And so, very occasionally, there have been places  and moments when there was, briefly, an end to pessimism. As far as  I know, no historian has investigated the history of optimism, but my  guess is that whenever it has emerged in a civilization there has been  a mini-enlightenment: a tradition of criticism resulting in an efflor- escence of many of the patterns of human progress with which we are  familiar, such as art, literature, philosophy, science, technology and the  institutions of an open society. The end of pessimism is potentially a  beginning of infinity. Yet I also guess that in every case – with the single,  tremendous exception (so far) of our own Enlightenment – this process  was soon brought to an end and the reign of pessimism was restored. The best-known mini-enlightenment was the intellectual and political  tradition of criticism in ancient Greece which culminated in the so-  called ‘Golden Age’ of the city-state of Athens in the fifth century  bce.  Athens was one of the first democracies, and was home to an astonish- ing number of people who are regarded to this day as major figures in  the history of ideas, such as the philosophers Socrates, Plato and  Aristotle, the playwrights Aeschylus, Aristophanes, Euripides and  Sophocles, and the historians Herodotus, Thucydides and Xenophon.  The Athenian philosophical tradition continued a tradition of criticism  dating back to Thales of Miletus over a century earlier and which had  included Xenophanes of Colophon (570–480  bce),  one of the first to  217 Optimism question anthropocentric theories of the gods. Athens grew wealthy  through trade, attracted creative people from all over the known world,  became one of the foremost military powers of the age, and built a  structure, the Parthenon, which is to this day regarded as one of the  great architectural achievements of all time. At the height of the Golden  Age, the Athenian leader Pericles tried to explain what made Athens  successful. Though he no doubt believed that the city’s patron goddess,  Athena, was on their side, he evidently did not consider ‘the goddess  did it’ to be a sufficient explanation for the Athenians’ success. Instead,  he listed specific attributes of Athenian civilization. We do not know  exactly how much of what he described was flattery or wishful thinking,  but, in assessing the optimism of a civilization, what that civilization  aspired to be must be even more important than what it had yet  succeeded in becoming. The first attribute that Pericles cited was Athens’ democracy. And  he explained why. Not because ‘the people should rule’, but because it  promotes ‘wise action’. It involves continual discussion, which is a  necessary condition for discovering the right answer, which is in turn  a necessary condition for progress: Instead of looking upon discussion as a stumbling-block in the way of  action, we think it an indispensable preliminary to any wise action at all. Pericles, ‘Funeral Oration’,  c . 431 bce He also mentioned  freedom  as a cause of

 in evidence. We happened to get round to  testing Newton’s laws in the seventeenth century, and Einstein’s in the  twentieth, but the evidence with which we did that – light from the  sky – had been deluging the surface of the Earth for billions of years  before that, and will continue to do so for billions more. Even today  we have barely begun to examine that evidence: on any clear night,  the chances are that your roof will be struck by evidence falling from  the sky which, if you only knew what to look for and how, would    win you a Nobel prize. In chemistry, every stable element that exists  62 the beginning of infinity anywhere is also present on or just below the Earth’s surface. In biology,  copious evidence of the nature of life is ubiquitous in the biosphere  – and within arm’s reach, in our own DNA. As far as we know,    all the fundamental constants of nature can be measured here, and    every fundamental law can be tested here. Everything needed for the    open-ended creation of knowledge is here in abundance, in the Earth’s  biosphere.  And the same is true of the moon. It has essentially the same resources  of mass, energy and evidence as the Earth has. Parochial details differ,  but the fact that humans living on the moon will have to make their  own air is no more significant than the fact that laboratories on Earth  have to make their own vacuum. Both tasks can be automated so as to  require arbitrarily little human effort or attention. Likewise, because  humans are universal constructors,  every  problem of finding or trans- form    ing resources can be no more than a transient factor limiting the  creation of knowledge in a given environment. And therefore matter,  energy and evidence are the only requirements that an environment  needs to have in order to be a venue for open-ended knowledge creation. Though any particular problem is a transient factor, the condition  of having to solve problems in order to survive and continue to create  knowledge is permanent. I have mentioned that there has never been  an unproblematic time for humans; that applies as much to the future  as to the past. Today on Earth, in the short run, there are still countless  problems to be solved to eliminate even starvation and other forms of  extreme human suffering that date back to prehistory. On a timescale  of decades, we shall be faced with choices to make substantial modifi- cations to the biosphere, or to keep it the same, or anything in between.  Whichever option we choose, it will be a project of planet-wide control,  requiring the creation of a great deal of scientific and tech  nological  knowledge as well as knowledge about how to make such decisions  rationally (see Chapter 13). In the even longer run, it is not only our  comfort and aesthetic sensibilities, and the suffering of individ  uals,  that are problematic, but, as always, the survival of our species. For  instance, at present during any given century there is about one chance  in a thousand that the Earth will be struck by a comet or asteroid large  enough to kill at least a substantial proportion of all human beings.  That means that a typical child born in the United States today is more  63 The Spark likely to die as a result of an astronomical event than a car accident.  Both are very low-probability events, but, unless we create a great deal  more scientific and technological knowledge than we have now, we  shall have no defence against those and other forms of natural disaster  that must, eventually, strike. Arguably there are more immediate  existential threats too – see Chapter 9. Setting up self-sufficient colonies on the moon and elsewhere in the  solar system – and eventually in other solar systems – will be a good  hedge against the extinction of our species or the destruction of civil- ization, and is a highly desirable goal for that reason among others.  As Hawking has said: I don’t think the human race will survive the next thousand years, unless  we spread into space. There are too many accidents that can befall life  on a single planet. But I’m an optimist. We will reach out to the stars. Daily Telegraph , 16 October 2001 But even that will be far from an unproblematic state. And most people  are not satisfied merely to be confident in the survival of the  species :  they want to survive personally. Also, like our earliest human ancestors,  they want to be free from physical danger and suffering. In future, as  various causes of suffering and death such as disease and ageing are  successively addressed and eliminated, and human life spans increase,  people will care about ever longer-term risks.  In fact people will always want still more than that: they will want  to make progress. For, in addition to threats, there will always be  problems in the benign sense of the word: errors, gaps, inconsistencies  and inadequacies in our knowledge that we wish to solve – including,  not least, moral knowledge: knowledge about
========================================================
 then interpret  those elements as being connected by the logic of a larger sentence or  program. Similarly, in behaviour parsing (which evolved millions of  years before human language parsing), an ape parses a continuous  stream of behaviour that it witnesses into individual elements, each of  which it already knows – genetically – how to imitate. The individual  408 the beginning of infinity elements can be inborn behaviours, such as biting; or behaviours  learned by trial and error, such as grasping a nettle without being stung;  or previously learned memes. As for connecting these elements together  in the right way without knowing why, it turns out that, in every known  case of complex behaviours in non-humans, the necessary information  can be obtained merely by watching the behaviour many times and  looking out for simple statistical patterns – such as which right-hand  behaviour often goes with which left-hand behaviour, and which  elements are often omitted. It is a very inefficient method, requiring a  lot of watching of behaviours that a human could mimic almost  immediately by understanding their purpose. Also, it allows only a few  fixed options for connecting the behaviours together, so only relatively  simple memes can be replicated. Apes can copy certain individual  actions instantly – the ones of which they have pre-existing knowledge  through their mirror-neuron system – but it takes them years to learn  a repertoire of memes that involve combinations of actions. Yet those  memes – trivially simple tricks by human standards – are enormously  valuable: using them, apes have privileged access to sources of food  that are closed to all other animals; and meme evolution gives them  the ability to switch to other sources far faster than gene evolution  would allow.  So, an ape knows (inexplicitly) that another ape is ‘picking up a  rock’, and not performing any of the countless other possible inter- pretations of the same actions, such as ‘picking up an object in a given  relative position’, because picking up a rock is in its inborn repertoire  of copiable behaviours while the other possibilities are not. Indeed, it  may well be that apes  cannot  imitate the behaviour of ‘picking up an  object in a given relative position’. Note, in this connection, that apes  are unable to imitate sounds. They cannot even parrot sounds (repeat  them blindly), despite having a complex inborn repertoire of calls that  they can make, recognize and act upon in genetically predetermined  ways. Their behaviour-parsing system simply did not evolve a pre  - determined translation mechanism from hearing sounds to uttering  them, so they cannot ape them. Consequently there are no customized  sounds in any of the apes’ memetically controlled behaviours. Thus, in the crucial respect that is relevant to meme replication,  aping has the same logic as parroting: like the parrot, the ape avoids  409 The Evolution of Creativity the infinite ambiguity of copying by already knowing, inexplicitly, the  meaning of every action that it is capable of copying. And it is only  capable of associating one meaning with each action that it can copy  – one definition of how to perform the ‘same’ action under various  circumstances. That is how ape memes can be replicated without the  impossible step of literally copying knowledge from another ape. The  recipient of the meme instantly recognizes the meaning of each element  of the behaviour; and it relates the elements by statistical analysis, not  by discovering how they support each other’s functioning.  Human beings acquiring human memes are doing something pro  - foundly different. When an audience is watching a lecture, or a child  is learning language, their problem is almost the opposite of that of  parroting or aping: the meaning of the behaviour that they are observ- ing is precisely what they are striving to discover and do not know in  advance. The actions themselves, and even the logic of how they are  connected, are largely secondary and are often entirely forgotten  afterwards. For example, as adults we remember few of the actual  sentences from which we learned to speak. If a parrot had copied  snatches of Popper’s voice at a lecture, it would certainly have copied  them with his Austrian accent: parrots are incapable of copying an  utterance without its accent. But a human student might well be unable  to copy it  with  the accent. In fact a student might well acquire a  complex meme at a lecture without being able to repeat a single  sentence spoken by the lecturer, even immediately afterwards. In such  a case the student has replicated the meaning – which is the whole  content – of the meme without imitating any actions at all. As I said,  imitation is not at the heart of human meme replication. Suppose that the lecturer had repeatedly returned to a certain key  idea, and had expressed it with different words and gestures each time.  The parrot’s (or ape’s) job would be
========================================================
 come to  a juddering halt like quantum theory did? Unfortunately, most philosophies of science since Mach’s have    been even worse (Popper’s being an important exception). During the  313 A Physicist’s History of Bad Philosophy twentieth century, anti-realism became almost universal among  philosophers, and common among scientists. Some denied that the  physical world exists at all, and most felt obliged to admit that, even  if it does, science has no access to it. For example, in ‘Reflections on  my Critics’ the philosopher Thomas Kuhn wrote: There is [a step] which many philosophers of science wish to take and  which I refuse. They wish, that is, to compare [scientific] theories as  representations of nature, as statements about ‘what is really out there’. Imre Lakatos and Alan Musgrave, eds.,  Criticism and the Growth  of Knowledge  (1979) Positivism degenerated into  logical positivism , which held that statements  not verifiable by observation are not only worthless but meaningless.  This doctrine threatened to sweep away not only explanatory scientific  knowledge but the whole of philosophy. In particular: logical positivism  itself is a philosophical theory, and it cannot be verified by observation;  hence it asserts its own meaninglessness (as well as that of all other  philosophy).  The logical positivists tried to rescue their theory from that implication  (for instance by calling it ‘logical’, as distinct from philosophical), but  in vain. Then Wittgenstein embraced the implication and declared all  philosophy, including his own, to be meaningless. He advocated remain- ing silent about philosophical problems, and, although he never attempted  to live up to that aspiration, he was hailed by many as one of the greatest  geniuses of the twentieth century.  One might have thought that this would be the nadir of philosophical  thinking but unfortunately there were greater depths to plumb. During  the second half of the twentieth century, mainstream philosophy lost  contact with, and interest in, trying to understand science as it was  actually being done, or how it should be done. Following Wittgenstein,  the predominant school of philosophy for a while was ‘linguistic  philosophy’, whose defining tenet was that what seem to be philo- sophical problems are actually just puzzles about how words are used  in everyday life, and that philosophers can meaningfully study only  that. Next, in a related trend that originated in the European Enlightenment  but spread all over the West, many philosophers moved away from  314 the beginning of infinity trying to understand  anything . They actively attacked the idea not only  of explanation and reality, but of truth, and of reason. Merely to  criticize such attacks for being self-contradictory like logical positivism  – which they were – is to give them far too much credence. For at least  the logical positivists and Wittgenstein were interested in making a  distinction  between what does and does not make sense – albeit that  they advocated a hopelessly wrong one. One currently influential philosophical movement goes under various  names such as postmodernism, deconstructionism and structuralism,  depending on historical details that are unimportant here. It claims  that because all ideas, including scientific theories, are conjectural and  impossible to justify, they are essentially arbitrary: they are no more  than stories, known in this context as ‘narratives’. Mixing extreme  cultural relativism with other forms of anti-realism, it regards objective  truth and falsity, as well as reality and knowledge of reality, as mere  conventional forms of words that stand for an idea’s being endorsed  by a designated group of people such as an elite or consensus, or by a  fashion or other arbitrary authority. And it regards science and the  Enlightenment as no more than one such fashion, and the objective  knowledge claimed by science as an arrogant cultural conceit. Perhaps inevitably, these charges are true of postmodernism itself: it  is a narrative that resists rational criticism or improvement, precisely  because it rejects all criticism as mere narrative. Creating a successful  postmodernist theory is indeed purely a matter of meeting the criteria  of the postmodernist community – which have evolved to be complex,  exclusive and authority-based. Nothing like that is true of rational ways  of thinking: creating a good explanation is hard not because of what  anyone has decided, but because there is an objective reality that does  not meet  anyone’s  prior expectations, including those of authorities.  The creators of bad explanations such as myths are indeed just making  things up. But the method of seeking good explanations creates an  engagement with reality, not only in science, but in good philosophy  too – which is why it works, and why it is the antithesis of concocting  stories to meet made-up criteria. Although there have been signs of improvement since

 belief when I asked whether you are sure that I am before  your eyes. I was only questioning how you can claim to be ‘seeing  clearly’ what is before your eyes when you also claim to be asleep! socrates:  Oh! Yes, you have caught me in an error – but surely only  a trivial one. Indeed, you may not be literally before my eyes. Perhaps  you are at home on Olympus, sending me a mere likeness of yourself.  But in that case you are controlling that likeness and I am seeing it,  and referring to it as ‘you’, so I am seeing ‘you’. hermes:  But that is not what I asked. I asked what is here  before your  eyes . In reality. socrates:  All right. Before my eyes, in reality, there is – a small room.  Or, if you want a literal reply, what is before my eyes is – eyelids,  since I expect that they are shut. Yet I see from your expression that  you want even more precision. Very well: before my eyes are the  inside surfaces  of my eyelids. hermes:  And can you see those? In other words, is it really ‘easy to  see’ what is before your eyes? 228 the beginning of infinity socrates:  Not at the moment. But that is only because I am dream- ing.  hermes: Is it  only  because you are dreaming? Are you saying that if  you were awake you would now be seeing the inside surfaces of  your eyelids?  socrates: [ carefully ] If I were awake with my eyes still closed, then  yes.  hermes:  What  colour  do you see when you close your eyes? socrates: In a  room as dimly lit as this one – black. hermes: Do  you think that the inside surfaces of your eyelids are  black? socrates: I  suppose not.  hermes: So  would you really be seeing them? socrates:  Not exactly.  hermes:  And if you were to open your eyes, would you be able to  see the room? socrates:  Only very vaguely. It is dark. hermes: So I  ask again: is it true that, if you were awake, you could  easily see what was before your eyes? socrates:  All right – not always. But nevertheless, when I am awake,  and with my eyes open,  and  in bright light – hermes:  But not  too  bright, I suppose? socrates: Yes,  yes. If you want to keep quibbling, I must accept that  when one is dazzled by the sun one may see even less well than in  the dark. Likewise one may see one’s own face behind a mirror where  there is in reality only empty space. One may sometimes see a mirage,  or be fooled by a pile of crumpled clothes that happens to resemble  a mythical creature – hermes: Or  one may be fooled by dreaming of one . . . socrates: [ Smiles. ] Quite so. And, conversely, whether sleeping or  waking, we often  fail  to see things that  are  there in reality. hermes: You  have no idea how many such things there are . . . socrates: No  doubt. But still, when one is  not  dreaming, and  conditions are  good  for seeing – hermes:  And how can you tell whether ‘conditions are good’ for  seeing? socrates:  Ah! Now you are trying to catch me in a circularity. You  229 A Dream of Socrates want me to say that one can tell that conditions are good for seeing  when one can easily see what is there.  hermes: I  want you  not  to say so.  socrates: It  seems to me that you have been asking questions about  me  – what is in front of me, what I can easily see, whether I am sure,  and so on. But I seek fundamental truths, of which I estimate that  not a single one is predominantly about me. So let me stress again:  I am  not  sure what is in front of my eyes – ever – with my eyes open  or closed, asleep or awake. Nor can I be sure what is  probably  in  front of my eyes, for how could I estimate the probability that I am  dreaming when I think I am awake? Or that my whole previous life  has been but a dream in which it has pleased one of you immortals  to imprison me?  hermes:  Indeed. socrates: I  might even be a victim of a mundane deception, such as  those of conjurers. We know that a conjurer is deceiving us because  he shows us something that cannot be – and then asks for money!  But if he were to forgo his fee and show me something that  can  be  but is not, how could I ever know? Perhaps this entire vision of you  is not a dream after all but some cunning conjurer’s trick. On the  other hand, perhaps you really are here in person and I am awake  after all. None of this can I ever be  sure  is so, or not so. I can, however,  conceive of  knowing  some of it . hermes:  Precisely. And is the same true of your  moral  knowledge? In  regard to what is right and wrong, could you be mistaken, or misled,  by the equivalent of mirages or tricks? socrates:  That seems harder to imagine. For in regard to moral  knowledge I need my senses very little: it is mainly just my own  thoughts. I  reason  about what is right and wrong, or what makes a  person virtuous or wicked. I can be mistaken, of course, in these  mental deliberations, but not so easily  deceived  by outside tricks or  illusions, for they affect only our senses and not our reason. hermes: How,  then, do you account for the fact that you Athenians  are

 only superficial? Was Beethoven fooling  himself when he thought that the sheets in his waste-paper basket  contained  mistakes : that they were  worse  than the sheets he would  eventually publish? Was he merely meeting the arbitrary standards of  his culture, like the twentieth-century women who carefully adjusted  their hemlines each year to conform to the latest fashions? Or is there  a real meaning to saying that the music of Beethoven and Mozart was  as far above that of their Stone Age ancestors banging mammoth bones  together as Ramanujan’s mathematics was above tally marks?  Is it an illusion that the  criteria  that Beethoven and Mozart were  trying to meet were better too? Or is there no such thing as better? Is  there only ‘I know what I like,’ or what tradition or authority designates  as good? Or what our genes predispose us to like? The psychologist  Shigeru Watanabe has found that sparrows prefer harmonious to  discordant music. Is that all that human artistic appreciation is? All these theories assume – with little or no argument – that for each  logically possible aesthetic standard there could exist, say, a culture in  which people would enjoy and be deeply moved by art that met that  standard. Or that a genetic predisposition could exist with the same  properties. But is it not much more plausible that only very exceptional  aesthetic standards could possibly end up as the norm of any culture,  or be the objective towards which some great artist, creating a new  artistic style, spent a lifetime working? Quite generally, cultural  relativism (about art or morality) has a very hard time explaining what  people are doing when they think they are improving a tradition.  Then there is the equivalent of instrumentalism: is art no more than  a means to non-artistic ends? For instance, artistic creations can deliver  information – a painting can depict something, and a piece of music  can represent an emotion. But their beauty is not primarily in that  content. It is in the form. For instance, here is a boring picture: 357 Why are Flowers Beautiful?  and here is another picture with much the same content: yet with greater aesthetic value. One can see that someone thought  about the second picture. In its composition, framing, cropping, light- ing, focus – it has the  appearance of design  by the photographer. But  design for what? Unlike Paley’s watch, it does not seem to have a  function – it only seems to be more beautiful than the first picture. But  what does that mean? One possible instrumental purpose of beauty is  attraction.  A beautiful  object can be attractive to people who appreciate the beauty. Attractive- ness (to a given audience) can be functional, and is a down-to-earth,  scientifically measurable quantity. Art can be literally attractive in the  sense of causing people to move towards it. Visitors to an art gallery  can see a painting and be reluctant to leave, and then later be caused,  by the painting, to return to it. People may travel great distances to  hear a musical performance – and so on. If you see a work of art that  358 the beginning of infinity you appreciate, that means that you want to dwell on it, to give it your  attention, in order to appreciate more in it. If you are an artist, and  halfway through creating a work of art you see something in it that  you want to bring out, then you are being attracted by a beauty that  you have not yet experienced. You are being attracted by the  idea  of a  piece of art before you have created it.  Not all attractiveness has anything to do with aesthetics. You lose  your balance and fall off a log because we are all attracted to the planet  Earth. That may seem merely a play on the word ‘attraction’: our  attraction to the Earth is due not to aesthetic appreciation but to a law  of physics, which affects artists no more than it does aardvarks. A red  traffic light may induce us to stop and stare at it so long as it remains  red. But that is not artistic appreciation either, even though it is  attraction. It is mechanical. But, when analysed in sufficient detail,  everything  is mechanical. The  laws of physics are sovereign. So, can one draw the conclusion that  beauty cannot have an objective meaning other than ‘that which we  are attracted to by processes in our brains and hence by the laws of  physics’? One cannot, because by that argument the physical world  would not exist objectively either, since the laws of physics also deter- mine what a scientist or mathematician wants to call true. Yet one  cannot  explain  what a mathematician does – or what Hofstadter’s  dominoes do – without referring to the objective truths of mathematics.  New art is unpredictable, like new scientific discoveries. Is that    the unpredictability of randomness, or the deeper unknowability of  knowledge-creation? In other words, is art truly creative, like science  and mathematics? That question is usually asked the other way round,  because

 forbidden by the laws  of physics (such as replanting a forest) can only be a matter of knowing  425 Unsustainable how. We know that finding out how is a matter of seeking good  explanations. We also know that whether a particular attempt to make  progress will succeed or not is profoundly unpredictable. It can be  understood in retrospect, but not in terms of factors that could have  been known in advance. Thus we now understand why alchemists never  succeeded at transmutation: because they would have had to understand  some nuclear physics first. But this could not have been known at the  time. And the progress that they did make – which led to the science  of chemistry – depended strongly on how individual alchemists  thought ,  and only peripherally on factors like which chemicals could be found  nearby. The conditions for a beginning of infinity exist in almost every  human habitation on Earth. In his book  Guns, Germs and Steel , the biogeographer Jared Diamond  takes the opposite view. He proposes what he calls an ‘ultimate ex    - planation’ of why human history was so different on different con  - tinents. In particular, he seeks to explain why it was Europeans who  sailed out to conquer the Americas, Australasia and Africa and not vice  versa. In Diamond’s view, the psychology and philosophy and politics  of historical events are no more than ephemeral ripples on the great  river of history. Its course is set by factors independent of human ideas  and decisions. Specifically, he says, the continents on our planet had  different natural resources – different geographies, plants, animals and  micro-organisms – and, details aside, that is what explains the broad  sweep of history, including which human ideas were created and what  decisions were made, politics, philosophy, cutlery and all. For example, part of his explanation of why the Americas never  developed a technological civilization before the advent of Europeans  is that there were no animals there suitable for domestication as beasts  of burden. Llamas are native to South America, and have been used as beasts of  burden since prehistoric times, so Diamond points out that they are  not native to the continent as a whole, but only to the Andes mountains.  Why did no technological civilization arise in the Andes mountains?  Why did the Incan Empire not have an Enlightenment? Diamond’s  position is that other biogeographical factors were unfavourable.  The communist thinker Friedrich Engels proposed the same ultimate  426 the beginning of infinity explanation of history, and made the same proviso about llamas,    in 1884: The Eastern Hemisphere . . . possessed nearly all the animals adaptable  to domestication . . . The Western Hemisphere, America, had no mammals  that could be domesticated except the llama, which, moreover, was only  found in one part of South America . . . Owing to these differences in  natural conditions, the population of each hemisphere now goes on its  own way . . . The Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State (Friedrich Engels, based on notes by Karl Marx) But why did llamas  continue  to be ‘only found in one part of South  America’, if they could have been useful elsewhere? Engels did not  address that issue. But Diamond realized that it ‘cries out for explan- ation’. Because, unless the reason that llamas were not exported was  itself biogeographical, Diamond’s ‘ultimate explanation’ is false. So he  proposed a biogeographical reason: he pointed out that a hot, lowland  region, unsuitable for llamas, separates the Andes from the highlands  of Central America where llamas would have been useful in agriculture. But, again,  why  must such a region have been a barrier to the spread  of domesticated llamas? Traders travelled between South and Central  America for centuries, perhaps overland and certainly by sea. Where  there are long-range traders, it is not necessary for an idea to be useful  in an unbroken line of places for it to be able to spread. As I remarked  in Chapter 11, knowledge has the unique ability to take aim at a distant  427 Unsustainable target and utterly transform it while having scarcely any effect on the  space between. So, what would it have taken for some of those traders  to take some llamas north for sale? Only the idea: the leap of imagin- ation to guess that if something is useful here, it might be useful there  too. And the boldness to take the speculative and physical risk.  Polynesian traders did exactly that. They ranged further, across a more  formidable natural barrier, carrying goods including livestock. Why  did none of the South American traders ever think of selling llamas to  the Central Americans? We may never know – but why should it have  had anything to do with geography? They may simply have been too  set in their ways. Perhaps innovative uses for animals were taboo.  Perhaps such a trade was attempted, but failed every time because of  sheer bad luck. But, whatever

 contrary,  it wiped them out because they  were  living the lifestyles that they  had evolved to live, and in which, according to the Spaceship Earth  metaphor, the biosphere had been ‘supporting’ them.  Yet that still overstates the degree to which the biosphere is hospitable  to humans in particular. The first people to live at the latitude of Oxford  (who were actually from a species related to us, possibly the Neanderthals)  50 the beginning of infinity could do so only because they brought knowledge with them, about  such things as tools, weapons, fire and clothing. That knowledge was  transmitted from generation to generation not genetically but culturally.  Our pre-human ancestors in the Great Rift Valley used such know-  ledge too, and our own species must have come into existence already  dependent on it for survival. As evidence of that, note that I would soon  die if I tried to live in the Great Rift Valley in its primeval state: I do  not have the requisite knowledge. Since then, there have been human  populations who, for instance, knew how to survive in the Amazon  jungle but not in the Arctic, and populations for whom it was the other  way round. Therefore that knowledge was not part of their genetic  inheritance. It was created by human thought, and preserved and  transmitted in human culture. Today, almost the entire capacity of the Earth’s ‘life-support system  for humans’ has been provided not  for  us but  by  us, using our ability  to create new knowledge. There are people in the Great Rift Valley  today who live far more comfortably than early humans did, and in  far greater numbers, through knowledge of things like tools, farming  and hygiene. The Earth did provide the raw materials for our survival  – just as the sun has provided the energy, and supernovae provided the  elements, and so on. But a heap of raw materials is not the same thing  as a life-support system. It takes knowledge to convert the one into  the other, and biological evolution never provided us with enough  knowledge to survive, let alone to thrive. In this respect we differ from  almost all other species. They do have all the knowledge that they need,  genetically encoded in their brains. And that knowledge was indeed  provided for them by evolution – and so, in the relevant sense, ‘by the  biosphere’. So  their  home environments do have the appearance of  having been designed as life-support systems for them, albeit only in  the desperately limited sense that I have described. But the biosphere  no more provides humans with a life-support system than it provides  us with radio telescopes. So the biosphere is incapable of supporting human life. From the  outset, it was only human knowledge that made the planet even  marginally habitable by humans, and the enormously increased capacity  of our life-support system since then (in terms both of numbers and  of security and quality of life) has been entirely due to the creation of  51 The Spark human knowledge. To the extent that we are on a ‘spaceship’, we have  never been merely its passengers, nor (as is often said) its stewards, nor  even its maintenance crew: we are its designers and builders. Before  the designs created by humans, it was not a vehicle, but only a heap  of dangerous raw materials. The ‘passengers’ metaphor is a misconception in another sense too.  It implies that there was a time when humans lived unproblematically:  when they were provided for, like pas    sengers, without themselves  having to solve a stream of problems in order to survive and to thrive.  But in fact, even with the benefit of their cultural knowledge, our  ancestors continually faced desperate problems, such as where the  next meal was coming from, and typically they barely solved these  problems or they died. There are very few fossils of old people. The moral component of the Spaceship Earth metaphor is therefore  somewhat paradoxical. It casts humans as ungrateful for gifts which,  in reality, they never received. And it casts all other species in morally  positive roles in the spaceship’s life-support system, with humans as  the only negative actors. But humans are part of the biosphere, and  the supposedly immoral behaviour is identical to what all other species  do when times are good – except that humans alone try to mitigate the  effect of that response on their descendants and on other species.  The Principle of Mediocrity is paradoxical too. Since it singles out  anthropocentrism for special opprobrium among all forms of parochial  misconception, it is itself anthropocentric. Also, it claims that all value  judgements are anthropocentric, yet it itself is often expressed in value- laden terminology, such as ‘arrogance’, ‘just scum’ and the very word  ‘mediocrity’. With respect to whose values are those disparagements  to be understood? Why is arrogance even relevant as a criticism? Also,  even if holding an arrogant opinion is morally wrong, morality is  supposed to

 possible computer programs  are running. What we think of as reality  is just virtual reality generated by one or more of those programs. Then  we define ‘common’ and ‘uncommon’ in terms of an average over all  those programs, counting programs in order of their lengths (how  many elementary operations each contains). But again that assumes  that there is a preferred notion of what an ‘elementary operation’ is.  Since the length and complexity of a program are entirely dependent  on the laws of physics, this theory again requires an external world in  which those computers run – a world that would be unknowable    to us. Both those approaches fail because they attempt to reverse the  direction of the real explanatory connection between physics and  computation. They seem plausible only because they rely on that  standard mistake of Zeno’s, applied to computation: the misconception  that the set of classically computable functions has an a-priori privileged  status within mathematics. But it does not. The only thing that privileges  that set of operations is that it is instantiated in the laws of physics.    The whole point of universality is lost if one conceives of computation  as being somehow prior to the physical world, generating its laws.  Computational universality is all about computers  inside  our physical  191 A Window on Infinity world being related to each other under the universal laws of physics  to which we (thereby) have access. How do all those drastic limitations on what can be known and what  can be achieved by mathematics and by computation, including the  existence of undecidable questions in mathematics, square with the  maxim that  problems are soluble ?  Problems are conflicts between ideas. Most mathematical questions  that exist abstractly never appear as the subject of such a conflict: they  are never the subject of curiosity, never the focus of conflicting mis  - conceptions about some attribute of the world of abstractions. In short,  most of them are uninteresting. Moreover, recall that finding proofs is not the purpose of math-  ematics: it is merely one of the methods of mathematics. The purpose  is to understand, and the overall method, as in all fields, is to make  conjectures and to criticize them according to how good they are as  explanations. One does not understand a mathematical proposition  merely by proving it true. This is why there are such things as math-  ematics lectures rather than just lists of proofs. And, conversely, the lack  of a proof does not necessarily prevent a proposition from being  understood. On the contrary, the usual order of events is for the  mathematician  first  to understand something about the abstraction  in question and  then  to use that understanding to conjecture how  true propositions about the abstraction might be proved, and  then  to  prove them.  A mathematical theorem can be proved, yet remain for ever un    - interesting. And an unproved mathematical conjecture can be fruitful  in providing explanations even if it remains unproved for centuries, or  even if it is unprovable. One example is the conjecture known in the  jargon of computer science as ‘P ≠ NP’. It is, roughly speaking, that there  exist classes of mathematical questions whose answers can be  verified   efficiently once one has them but cannot be  computed  efficiently in the  first place by a universal (classical) computer. (‘Efficient’ computation  has a technical definition that roughly approximates what we mean  by the phrase in practice.) Almost all researchers in computing theory  are sure that the conjecture is true (which is further refutation of the  idea that mathematical knowledge consists only of proofs). That is  192 the beginning of infinity because, although no proof is known, there are fairly good explanations  of why we should expect it to be true, and none to the contrary. (And  so the same is thought to hold for quantum computers.) Moreover, a vast amount of mathematical knowledge that is both  useful and interesting has been built on the conjecture. It includes  theorems of the form ‘ if  the conjecture is true then this interesting  consequence follows.’ And there are fewer, but still interesting, theorems  about what would follow if it were false. A mathematician studying an undecidable question may  prove  that  it is undecidable (and explain why). From the mathematician’s point  of view, that is a success. Though it does not answer the  mathematical  question , it solves the  mathematician’s problem.  Even working on a  mathematical problem without any of those kinds of success is still  not the same as failing to create knowledge. Whenever one tries and  fails to solve a mathematical problem one has discovered a theorem  – and usually also an explanation – about why that approach to solving  it does not work.  Hence, undecidability no more contradicts the maxim that problems  are soluble than does the fact that there are truths about the

 hostile that they barely permit astrophysicists  at all. So, if we imagine all the values consistent with the emergence of  astrophysicists arrayed on a line, then the anthropic explanation leads  us to expect the measured value to fall at some typical point, not too  close to the middle or to either end. 100 the beginning of infinity However – and here we are reaching Sciama’s main conclusion – that  prediction changes radically if there are  several  constants to explain.  For although any one constant is unlikely to be near the edge of its  range, the more constants there are, the more likely it is that at least  one of them will be. This can be illustrated pictorially as follows, with  our bull’s-eye replaced by a line segment, a square, a cube . . . and we  can imagine this sequence continuing for as many dimensions as there  are fine-tuned constants in nature. Arbitrarily define ‘near the edge’ as  meaning ‘within 10 per cent of the whole range from it’. Then in the  case of one constant, as shown in the diagram, 20 per cent of its possible  values are near one of the two edges of the range, and 80 per cent are  ‘away from the edge’. But with two constants a pair of values has to  satisfy two constraints in order to be ‘away from the edge’. Only 64  per cent of them do so. Hence 36 per cent are near the edge. With three  constants, nearly half the possible choices are near the edge. With 100  constants, over 99.9999999 per cent of them are. Whatever anthropic reasoning predicts about the values of multiple    constants, it predicts will only just happen. So, the more constants are involved, the closer to having no astro- physicists a typical universe- with -astrophysicists is. It is not known  how many constants are involved, but it seems to be several, in which  101 Creation case the overwhelming majority of universes in the anthropically  selected region would be close to its edge. Hence, Sciama concluded,  the anthropic explanation predicts that the universe is  only just  capable  of producing astrophysicists – almost the opposite prediction from the  one that it makes in the case of one constant. On the face of it, this might in turn seem to explain another great  unsolved scientific mystery, known as ‘Fermi’s problem’, named after  the physicist Enrico Fermi, who is said to have asked, ‘ Where are they? ’  Where are the extraterrestrial civilizations? Given the Principle of  Mediocrity, or even just what we know of the galaxy and the universe,  there is no reason to believe that the phenomenon of astrophysicists  is unique to our planet. Similar conditions presumably exist in many  other solar systems, so why would some of them not produce similar  outcomes? Moreover, given the timescales on which stars and galaxies  develop, it is overwhelmingly unlikely that any given extraterrestrial  civilization is currently at a similar state of technological development  to ours: it is likely to be millions of years younger (i.e. non-existent)  or older. The older civilizations have had plenty of time to explore the  galaxy – or at least to send robot space probes or signals. Fermi’s  problem is that we do not see any such civilizations, probes or signals.  Many candidate explanations have been proposed, and none of them,  so far, are very good. The anthropic explanation of fine-tuning, in the  light of Sciama’s argument, might seem to solve the problem neatly:    if the constants of physics in our universe are only just capable of  producing astrophysicists, then it is not surprising that this event has  happened only once, since its happening twice independently in the  same universe would be vanishingly unlikely. Unfortunately, that turns out to be a bad explanation too, because  focusing on fundamental  constants  is parochial: there is no relevant  difference between (1) ‘the same’ laws of physics with different constants  and (2) different laws of physics. And there are infinitely many logically  possible laws of physics. If they were all instantiated in real universes  – as has been suggested by some cosmologists, such as Max Tegmark –    it would be statistically certain that our universe is exactly on the edge  of the astrophysicist-producing class of universes.  We know that that cannot be so from an argument due to Feynman  (which he applied to a slightly different problem). Consider the class  102 the beginning of infinity of all possible universes that contain astrophysicists, and consider what  else  most of them contain. In particular, consider a sphere just large  enough to contain your own brain. If you are interested in explaining  fine-tuning, your brain in its current state counts as an ‘astrophysicist’  for these purposes. In the class of all universes that contain astro- physicists, there are many that contain a sphere whose interior is  perfectly identical to the interior of your sphere, including every detail  of your brain. But in the vast majority of those universes there is

 It may seem strange that scientific instruments bring us closer to reality  when in purely physical terms they only ever separate us further from  it. But we observe nothing directly anyway. All observation is theory- laden. Likewise, whenever we make an error, it is an error in the  explanation of something. That is why appearances can be deceptive,  and it is also why we, and our instruments, can correct for that decep- tiveness. The growth of knowledge consists of correcting misconceptions  in our theories. Edison said that research is one per cent inspiration and  ninety-nine per cent perspiration – but that is misleading, because people  can apply creativity even to tasks that computers and other machines  do uncreatively. So science is not mindless toil for which rare moments  of discovery are the compensation: the toil can be creative, and fun, just  as the discovery of new explanations is. Now, can this creativity – and this fun – continue indefinitely? 42 3 The Spark Most ancient accounts of the reality beyond our everyday experience  were not only false, they had a radically different character from modern  ones: they were  anthropocentric . That is to say, they centred on human  beings, and more broadly on  people  – entities with intentions and  human-like thoughts – which included powerful, supernatural people  such as spirits and gods. So, winter might be attributed to someone’s  sadness, harvests to someone’s generosity, natural disasters to someone’s  anger, and so on. Such explanations often involved cosmically significant  beings caring what humans did, or having intentions about them. This  conferred cosmic significance on humans too. Then the geocentric theory  placed humans at the physical hub of the universe as well. Those two  kinds of anthropocentrism – explanatory and geometrical – made each  other more plausible, and, as a result, pre-Enlightenment thinking was  more anthropocentric than we can readily imagine nowadays.  A notable exception was the science of geometry itself, especially  the system developed by the ancient Greek mathematician Euclid. Its  elegant axioms and modes of reasoning about impersonal entities such  as points and lines would later be an inspiration to many of the pioneers  of the Enlightenment. But until then it had little impact on prevailing  world views. For example, most astronomers were also astrologers:  despite using sophisticated geometry in their work, they believed that  the stars foretold political and personal events on Earth.  Before anything was known about how the world works, trying    to explain physical phenomena in terms of purposeful, human-like  thought and action may have been a reasonable approach. After all,  that is how we explain much of our everyday experience even today:  if a jewel is mysteriously missing from a locked safe, we seek human- 43 The Spark level explanations such as error or theft (or, under some circumstances,  conjuring), not new laws of physics. But that anthropocentric approach  has never yielded any good explanations beyond the realm of human  affairs. In regard to the physical world at large, it was colossally  misconceived. We now know that the patterns of stars and planets in  our night sky have no significance for human affairs. We know that  we are not at the centre of the universe – it does not even have a  geometrical centre. And we know that, although some of the titanic  astrophysical phenomena that I have described played a significant  role in our past, we have never been significant to them. We call a  phenomenon  significant  (or  fundamental ) if parochial theories are  inadequate to explain it, or if it appears in the explanation of many  other phenomena; so it may seem that human beings and their wishes  and actions are extremely insignificant in the universe at large. Anthropocentric misconceptions have also been overturned in every  other fundamental area of science: our knowledge of physics is now  expressed entirely in terms of entities that are as impersonal as Euclid’s  points and lines, such as elementary particles, forces and spacetime – a  four-dimensional continuum with three dimensions of space and one  of time. Their effects on each other are explained not in terms of feelings  and intentions, but through mathematical equations expressing laws  of nature. In biology, it was once thought that living things must have  been designed by a supernatural person, and that they must contain  some special ingredient, a ‘vital principle’, to make them behave with  apparent purposefulness. But biological science discovered new modes  of explanation through such impersonal things as chemical reactions,  genes and evolution. So we now know that living things, including  humans, all consist of the same ingredients as rocks and stars, and    obey the same laws, and that they were not designed by anyone.  Modern science, far from explaining physical phenomena in terms of  the thoughts and intentions

 myriad  individuals who can conceive of no improvement of themselves  nevertheless add up to a  city  that relentlessly seeks nothing else for  itself, day and night.  chaerephon: Yes, I  see.  socrates: In  Sparta there are no such politicians, and no such  sophists. And no gadflies such as me, because any Spartan who did  doubt or disapprove of the way things have always been done would  keep it to himself. What few new ideas they have are intended to  sustain the city more securely in its current state. As for war, I know  that there are Spartans who glory in war, and would love to conquer  and enslave the whole world, just as they once set out to conquer  their neighbours. Yet the institutions of their city, and the deep  assumptions that are built into the minds of even the hotheads,  embody a visceral fear of any such step into the unknown. Perhaps  it is significant that the statue of Ares that stands outside Sparta  represents him  chained , so that he will always be there to protect  the city. Is that not the same as preventing the god of violence from  breaking discipline? From being loosed upon the world to cause  random mayhem, with its terrifying risk of change? chaerephon:  Perhaps it is. In any case, I understand now, Socrates,  how a city can have ‘overarching concerns’ that are not shared by  all its citizens. However, I’m afraid I still don’t see how your theory  accounts for the  enmity  between our cities. First of all, I cannot recall  the Spartans ever objecting to our propensity to improve ourselves.  Instead, they cite all sorts of specific grievances about how we are  allegedly violating treaties, undermining their allies, plotting to build  249 A Dream of Socrates an empire on the mainland and so on. Second – not that I want to  criticize the god, of course! – socrates: It is  not impious to criticize the gods, Chaerephon, but  rational. Hermes thinks so too, for what it’s worth . . . plato : [ Scribbles,   ‘It is not impious to criticize gods.’ ] chaerephon: W ell, even if the god is right about those two ‘over- arching concerns’ of stasis and improvement, each city holds its  respective concern  only for itself.  It has no ambition to impose it  on anyone else. So, although Athens chooses to race forwards  while Sparta chooses to tie itself down, and although these choices  may logically be ‘opposite’, how can they possibly be a source of  enmity ? socrates: My  guess is this. The very existence of Athens, however  peaceful, is a deadly threat to Sparta’s stasis. And therefore, in the  long run, the condition for the continued stasis of Sparta (which  means its continued  existence , as they see it) is the destruction of  progress in Athens (which from our perspective would constitute  the destruction of Athens).  chaerephon: I  still do not see specifically what the threat is. socrates: W ell, suppose that in future both cities were to continue  to succeed with their overarching concerns. The Spartans would  stay exactly as they are now. But we Athenians are already the envy  of other Greeks with our wealth and diverse achievements. What  will happen when we improve further, and begin to outshine  everyone in the world  at  everything ? Spartans seldom travel or  interact with foreigners, but they cannot keep themselves entirely  in ignorance of developments elsewhere. Even going to war gives  them some inkling of what life is like in other cities that are  wealthier, and freer, than they. One day, some Spartan youths  visiting Delphi will find that it is the Athenians who have the    better ‘moves’ and the greater skill. And what if, in a generation  or two, Athenian warriors have developed some better ‘moves’  on  the battlefield ?  plato : But, Socrates, even if this is true, the Spartans are unaware of  it! So how can they fear it? socrates:  They need no prescience. Do you think that a Spartan  messenger, on reaching Athens, does not gasp in admiration like  250 the beginning of infinity everyone else when he sees what stands on our Acropolis?* And,  however much he may mutter (perhaps justly) about our hubris and  irresponsibility, do you think that he does not reflect, on his way  home, that his city can never and will never attract that sort of  admiration from anyone? Do you think that the Spartan elders are  not at this very moment worrying about the growing reputation of  democracy  in many cities, including some of their allies?      By the way, we ourselves should be at least as wary of democracy  as I think the Spartans are of bloodlust and battle rage, for it is  intrinsically as dangerous. We could not do without our democracy  any more than the Spartans could do without their military training.  And, just as they have moderated the destructiveness of bloodlust  through their traditions of discipline and caution, we have moderated  the destructiveness of democracy through our traditions of virtue,  tolerance and liberty. We are utterly dependent on those

 tell from the rule of thumb whether  it would be possible to perform the trick with lighted candles instead  of balls. If I had an explanation of how the trick worked, I could tell.  Explanations are also essential for arriving at a rule of thumb in the  first place: I could not have guessed those predictions about conjuring  tricks without having a great deal of explanatory information in mind  – even before any specific explanation of how the trick works. For  instance, it is only in the light of explanations that I could have  abstracted the concept of  cups  and  balls  from my experience of the  trick, rather than, say,  red  and  blue , even if it so happened that the  cups were red and the balls blue in every instance of the trick that I  had witnessed. The essence of experimental testing is that there are at least two  apparently viable theories known about the issue in question, making  conflicting predictions that can be distinguished by the experiment.  Just as conflicting predictions are the occasion for experiment and  17 The Reach of Explanations observation, so  conflicting ideas  in a broader sense are the occasion  for all rational thought and inquiry. For example, if we are simply  curious about something, it means that we believe that our existing  ideas do not adequately capture or explain it. So, we have some  criterion  that our best existing explanation fails to meet .  The criterion  and the existing explanation are conflicting ideas. I shall call a situation  in which we experience conflicting ideas a  problem .  The example of a conjuring trick illustrates how observations provide  problems for science – dependent, as always, on prior explanatory  theories. For a conjuring trick is a trick only if it makes us think that  something happened  that  cannot happen . Both halves of that proposition  depend on our bringing quite a rich set of explanatory theories to the  experience. That is why a trick that mystifies an adult may be uninterest- ing to a young child who has not yet learned to have the expectations  on which the trick relies. Even those members of the audience who are  incurious about how the trick works can detect that it  is  a trick only  because of the explanatory theories that they brought with them into  the auditorium.  Solving  a problem means creating an explanation that  does not have the conflict.  Similarly, no one would have wondered what stars are if there had  not been existing expectations – explanations – that unsupported things  fall, and that lights need fuel, which runs out, and so on, which con  - flicted with interpretations (which are also explanations) of what was  seen, such as that the stars shine constantly and do not fall. In this case  it was those interpretations that were false: stars are indeed in free fall  and do need fuel. But it took a great deal of conjecture, criticism and  testing to discover how that can be. A problem can also arise purely theoretically, without any obser- vations. For instance, there is a problem when a theory makes a  prediction that we did not expect. Expectations are theories too.  Similarly, it is a problem when the way things  are  (according to our  best explanation) is not the way they  should be  – that is, according to  our current criterion of how they should be. This covers the whole  range of ordinary meanings of the word ‘problem’, from unpleasant,  as when the Apollo 13 mission reported, ‘Houston, we’ve had a problem  here,’ to pleasant, as when Popper wrote: 18 the beginning of infinity I think that there is only one way to science – or to philosophy, for that  matter: to meet a problem, to see its beauty and fall in love with it; to  get married to it and to live with it happily, till death do ye part – unless  you should meet another and even more fascinating problem or unless,  indeed, you should obtain a solution. But even if you do obtain a solution,  you may then discover, to your delight, the existence of a whole family  of enchanting, though perhaps difficult, problem children . . .  Realism and the Aim of Science  (1983) Experimental testing involves many prior explanations in addition  to the ones being tested, such as theories of how measuring instruments  work. The refutation of a scientific theory has, from the point of view  of someone who expected it to be true, the same logic as a conjuring  trick – the only difference being that a conjurer does not normally have  access to unknown laws of nature to make a trick work. Since theories can contradict each other, but there are no contra- dictions in reality, every problem signals that our knowledge must be  flawed or inadequate. Our misconception could be about the reality  we are observing, or about how our perceptions are related to it, or  both. For instance, a conjuring trick presents us with a problem only  because we have misconceptions about what ‘must’ be happening –  which implies that the knowledge that we used to interpret what

 unmatched repu- tation for insolubility (except among believers in the supernatural):    it is taken to be the epitome of an insuperable obstacle. But there is    no rational basis for that reputation. It is absurdly parochial to read  some deep significance into this particular failure, among so many,    of the biosphere to support human life – or of medical science through-  out the ages to cure ageing. The problem of ageing is of the same    general type as that of disease. Although it is a complex problem by  present-day standards, the complexity is finite and confined to a  relatively narrow arena whose basic principles are already fairly well  understood. Meanwhile, knowledge in the relevant fields is increasing  exponentially. 214 the beginning of infinity Sometimes ‘immortality’ (in this sense) is even regarded as undesir- able. For instance, there are arguments from overpopulation; but those  are examples of the Malthusian prophetic fallacy: what each additional  surviving person would need to survive at present-day standards of  living is easily calculated; what knowledge that person would contri- bute to the solution of the resulting problems is unknowable. There  are also arguments about the stultification of society caused by the  entrenchment of old people in positions of power; but the traditions  of criticism in our society are already well adapted to solving that sort  of problem. Even today, it is common in Western countries for powerful  politicians or business executives to be removed from office while still  in good health.  There is a traditional optimistic story that runs as follows. Our hero  is a prisoner who has been sentenced to death by a tyrannical king,  but gains a reprieve by promising to teach the king’s favourite horse  to talk within a year. That night, a fellow prisoner asks what possessed  him to make such a bargain. He replies, ‘A lot can happen in a year.  The horse might die. The king might die. I might die. Or the horse  might talk!’ The prisoner understands that, while his immediate  problems have to do with prison bars and the king and his horse,  ultimately the evil he faces is caused by insufficient knowledge. That  makes him an optimist. He knows that, if progress is to be made, some  of the opportunities and some of the discoveries will be inconceivable  in advance. Progress cannot take place at all unless someone is open  to, and prepares for, those inconceivable possibilities. The prisoner  may or may not discover a way of teaching the horse to talk. But he  may discover something else. He may persuade the king to repeal the  law that he had broken; he may learn a convincing conjuring trick in  which the horse would seem to talk; he may escape; he may think of  an achievable task that would please the king even more than making  the horse talk. The list is infinite. Even if every such possibility is  unlikely, it takes only one of them to be realized for the whole problem  to be solved. But if our prisoner is going to escape by creating a new  idea, he cannot possibly know that idea today, and therefore he cannot  let the assumption that it will never exist condition his planning. Optimism implies all the other necessary conditions for knowledge  to grow, and for knowledge-creating civilizations to last, and hence  215 Optimism for the beginning of infinity. We have, as Popper put it, a duty to be  optimistic – in general, and about civilization in particular. One can  argue that saving civilization will be difficult. That does not mean that  there is a low probability of solving the associated problems. When we  say that a mathematical problem is hard to solve, we do not mean that  it is  unlikely  to be solved. All sorts of factors determine whether  mathematicians even address a problem, and with what effort. If an  easy problem is not deemed to be interesting or useful, they might leave  it unsolved indefinitely, while hard problems are solved all the time. Usually the hardness of a problem is one of the very factors that  cause it to be solved. Thus President John F. Kennedy said in 1962, in  a celebrated example of an optimistic approach to the unknown, ‘We  choose to go to the moon. We choose to go to the moon in this decade  and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they  are hard.’ Kennedy did not mean that the moon project, being hard,  was unlikely to succeed. On the contrary, he believed that it would.  What he meant by a hard task was one that depends on facing the  unknown. And the intuitive fact to which he was appealing was that  although such hardness is always a negative factor when choosing  among  means  to pursue an objective, when choosing the objective itself  it can be a positive one, because we want to engage with projects that  will involve creating new knowledge. And an optimist expects the  creation of knowledge to constitute progress – including its unforesee- able consequences. Thus, Kennedy remarked that

 universe does not imply that you  will be happy if you make the ‘corresponding’ decision. Once there are  differences between the universes (and without such differences news  from the other universe is not news), there is no good reason to expect  the outcome of a decision to be unaffected by them. In one universe, you  met because of an accidental shared experience; in the other, because  you have illegally used the ship’s equipment. Can that affect the happiness  of a marriage? Perhaps not, but you can only know that if you have    a good explanatory theory of which factors affect the outcomes of  marriages and which do not. And if you have such a theory, then perhaps  you have no need to be skulking in transporter rooms. Still more generally, the benefit of inter-universe communication  would be, in effect, that it permits new forms of information processing.  In the fictional case I have described, since the two universes have been  identical until quite recently, communicating with one’s other-universe  counterpart achieves the same effect as running a computer simulation  of an alternative version of a period of one’s own life, without having  to know all the relevant physical variables explicitly. This computation  272 the beginning of infinity is infeasible in any other way, and could be helpful in testing explana- tory theories of how various factors affect outcomes. Nevertheless,    it is no substitute for thinking of those theories in the first place.  Therefore, if such communication is a scarce resource, a more  efficient way of using it might be to exchange the theories themselves:  if your  doppelgänger  solves a problem and tells you the solution, then  you can see for yourself that it is a good explanation even if you have  no way of knowing how your  doppelgänger  arrived at it. Another efficient use of inter-universe communication might be to  share the work of a lengthy computation. For instance, the story  might be that some crew members have been poisoned and will die  within hours unless the antidote is administered. To find the antidote  requires computer simulations of the effects of many variants of a  drug. So the two instances of the ship’s computer can each search  half the list of variants, thus running through the full list in half the  time. When the cure is found in one universe, its number in the list  can be transmitted to the other universe, the result can be checked  there, and the crew in both universes are saved. Again, evidence that  there is computer power accessible in this way through the transporter  would be evidence that there really was a computer out there, per    - forming different calculations from one’s own. Reflecting on the  details (about what the  doppelgängers  breathe and so on) would then  let the inhabitants know that the other universe as a whole was a  real place with similar structure and complexity to their own. So  their world would be explicable.  Since there is no inter-universe communication in real quantum  physics, we shall not allow it in our story, and so that specific route to  explicability is not open. The history in which our crew members are  married and the one in which they still hardly know each other cannot  communicate  with each other or  observe  each other. Nevertheless, as  we shall see, there are circumstances in which histories can still  affect   each other in ways that do not amount to communication, and the  need to explain those effects provides the main argument that our own  multiverse is real. After the universes in our story begin to differ inside one starship,  everything else in the world exists in pairs of identical instances. We  must continue to imagine those pairs as being fungible. This is necessary  273 The Multiverse because the universes are not ‘receptacles’ – there is nothing to them  apart from the objects that they contain. If they did have an independent  reality, then each of the objects in such a pair would have a property  of being in one particular universe and not the other, which would  make them non-fungible.  Typically, the region in which the universes are different will then  grow. For instance, when the couple decide to marry, they send messages  to their home planets announcing this. When the messages arrive, the  two instances of each of those planets become different. Previously  only the two instances of the starship were different, bur soon, even  before anyone broadcasts it intentionally, some of the information    will have leaked out. For instance, people in the starship are moving  differently in the two universes as a result of the marriage decision, so  light bounces off them differently and some of it leaves the starship  through portholes, making the two universes slightly different wherever  it goes. The same is true of heat radiation (infra-red light), which leaves  the starship through every point on the hull. Thus, starting with the  voltage happening in only one

 counter-intuitive properties, some of which are illustrated by  Hilbert’s thought experiment of Infinity Hotel. One of them is that, if  195 A Window on Infinity unlimited progress really is going to happen, not only are we now at  almost the very beginning of it, we always shall be. Cantor proved, with  his diagonal argument, that there are infinitely many levels of infinity,  of which physics uses at most the first one or two: the infinity of the  natural numbers and the infinity of the continuum. Where there are  infinitely many identical copies of an observer (for instance in multiple  universes), probability and proportions do not make sense unless the  collection as a whole has a structure subject to laws of physics that give  them meaning. A mere infinite sequence of universes, like the rooms in    In  finity Hotel, does not have such structure, which means that anthropic  reasoning by itself is insufficient to explain the apparent ‘fine-tuning’  of the constants of physics. Proof is a physical process: whether a  mathematical proposition is provable or unprovable, de    cidable or  undecidable, depends on the laws of physics, which determine which  abstract entities and relationships are modelled by physical objects.  Similarly, whether a task or pattern is simple or complex depends on  what the laws of physics are. 196 9 Optimism The possibilities that lie in the future are infinite. When I say  ‘It is our duty to remain optimists,’ this includes not only the  openness of the future but also that which all of us contribute  to it by everything we do: we are all responsible for what the  future holds in store. Thus it is our duty, not to prophesy evil  but, rather, to fight for a better world. Karl Popper,  The Myth of the Framework  (1994) Martin Rees suspects that civilization was lucky to survive the twentieth  century. For throughout the Cold War there was always a possibility  that another world war would break out, this time fought with hydrogen  bombs, and that civilization would be destroyed. That danger seems to  have receded, but in Rees’s book  Our Final Century , published in 2003,  he came to the worrying conclusion that civilization now had only a  50 per cent chance of surviving the twenty-first century.  Again this was because of the danger that newly created knowledge  would have catastrophic consequences. For example, Rees thought it  likely that civilization-destroying weapons, particularly biological ones,  would soon become so easy to make that terrorist organizations, or  even malevolent individuals, could not be prevented from acquiring  them. He also feared accidental catastrophes, such as the escape of  genetically modified micro-organisms from a laboratory, resulting in  a pandemic of an incurable disease. Intelligent robots, and nano- technology (engineering on the atomic scale), ‘could in the long run be  even more threatening’, he wrote. And ‘it is not inconceivable that  physics could be dangerous too.’ For instance, it has been suggested  197 Optimism that elementary-particle accelerators that briefly create conditions that  are in some respects more extreme than any since the Big Bang might  destabilize the very vacuum of space and destroy our entire universe.  Rees pointed out that, for his conclusion to hold, it is not necessary  for any one of those catastrophes to be at all probable, because we  need be unlucky only once, and we incur the risk afresh every time  progress is made in a variety of fields. He compared this with playing  Russian roulette.  But there is a crucial difference between the human condition and  Russian roulette: the probability of winning at Russian roulette is  unaffected by anything that the player may think or do. Within its  rules, it is a game of pure chance. In contrast, the future of civilization  depends entirely on what we think and do. If civilization falls, that will  not be something that just happens to us: it will be the outcome of  choices that people make. If civilization survives, that will be because  people succeed in solving the problems of survival, and that too will  not have happened by chance.  Both the future of civilization and the outcome of a game of Russian  roulette are unpredictable, but in different senses and for entirely  unrelated reasons. Russian roulette is merely  random . Although we  cannot predict the outcome, we do know what the possible outcomes  are, and the probability of each, provided that the rules of the game  are obeyed. The future of civilization is  unknowable , because the  knowledge that is going to affect it has yet to be created. Hence the  possible outcomes are not yet known, let alone their probabilities. The growth of knowledge cannot change that fact. On the contrary,  it contributes strongly to it: the ability of scientific theories to predict  the future depends on the reach of their explanations, but no explan- ation has enough reach to predict the content of its own successors –

 here to play debating tricks!  Are you denying your own existence now? When sophists do that,  I usually take them at their word and stop arguing with them. hermes: A  policy that again bespeaks your wisdom, Socrates. But I  have not denied my existence. I was only questioning  what difference  it makes  whether I am real or not. Would it make you change your  mind about anything that you have learned about epistemology  during this conversation? 237 A Dream of Socrates socrates:  Perhaps not . . . hermes:  Perhaps  not? Come now, Socrates, you were boasting earlier  that you and your fellow citizens are always open to persuasion. socrates: Yes, I  see. hermes: Now, if I  am  only a figment of your imagination, then who  has persuaded you?  socrates:  Presumably I myself – unless this dream is coming neither  from you nor from within myself, but from some other source . . . hermes:  But did you not say that you are open to persuasion  by  anyone ? If dreams emanate from an unknown source, what difference  should that make? If they are persuasive, are you not honour-bound  as an Athenian to accept them? socrates: It  seems that I am. But what if a dream were to emanate  from a malevolent source? hermes:  That makes no fundamental difference either. Suppose that  the source purports to tell you a fact. Then, if you suspect that the  source is malevolent, you will try to understand what evil it is trying  to perpetrate by telling you the alleged fact. But then, depending on  your explanation, you may well decide to believe it anyway – socrates: I  see. For instance, if an enemy announces that he is  planning to kill me, I may well believe him despite his malevolence. hermes: Yes. Or  you may not. And if your closest friend purports to  tell you a fact, you may likewise wonder whether  he  has been misled  by a malevolent third party – or is simply mistaken for any of  countless reasons. Thus situations can easily arise in which you  disbelieve your closest friend and believe your worst enemy. What  matters in all cases is the explanation you create, within your own  mind, for the facts, and for the observations and advice in question.      But the case here is simpler. As I said, I reveal no facts. I’m only  making arguments. socrates: I  see. I have no need to trust the source if the argument  itself is persuasive. And no way of using  any  source unless I also  have a persuasive argument.     Wait a moment – I’ve just realized something. You ‘reveal no facts’.  But the god Apollo  does  reveal facts, hundreds of them every day,  through the Oracle. Aha, I understand now. You are not Apollo, but  a different god.  238 the beginning of infinity hermes: [ Is silent. ] socrates: Y ou’re evidently a god of knowledge . . . but several gods  have an interest in knowledge. Athena herself does – but I can tell  that you are not she. hermes: No  you can’t. socrates: Yes I  can. I don’t mean from your appearance. I mean  I can infer it from the detached way you speak of Athens. So – I  think you are Hermes. God of knowledge, and of messages, and of  information flow – hermes: A  fine thought. But, by the way, what makes you think that  Apollo  reveals   facts  through the Oracle? socrates:  Oh!  hermes: We  have agreed that by ‘reveal’ we mean telling the sup  - plicant something that he doesn’t yet know . . . socrates:  Are  all  its replies just jokes and tricks?  hermes: [ Is silent. ] socrates: As  you wish, fleet Hermes. Then let me try to understand  your argument about knowledge. I asked where knowledge comes  from, and you directed my attention to this very dream. You asked  whether it would make any difference to how I regard the knowledge  I am learning from you if it turns out not to have been supernaturally  inspired after all. And I had to agree that it would not. So am I to  conclude that . . . all knowledge originates from the same source as  dreams? Which is within ourselves? hermes: Of  course it does. Do you remember what Xenophanes wrote  just after he said that objective knowledge is attainable by humans? socrates: Yes.  The passage continues: But as for certain truth, no man has known it, Nor will he know it; neither of the gods, Nor yet of all things of which I speak. And even if by chance he were to utter The perfect truth, he would himself not know it –   So there he’s saying that, although objective knowledge is attainable,  justified belief (‘certain truth’) is not. hermes: Yes,  we’ve covered all that. But your answer is in the next  line. 239 A Dream of Socrates socrates:  ‘For all is but a woven web of guesses.’ Guesses!  hermes: Yes.  Conjectures. socrates:  But wait! What about when knowledge  does not  come  from guesswork – as when a god sends me a dream? What about  when I simply hear ideas from other people?  They  may have guessed  them, but I then obtain them merely by listening. hermes: You do  not. In all those cases, you still have to guess in order  to acquire the knowledge.

 thing as one object being objectively more beautiful than another.  Mathematics has its proofs (so the argument goes), and science has its  experimental tests; but if you choose to believe that Mozart was an  inept and cacophonous composer then neither logic nor experiment  nor anything else objective will ever contradict you.  However, it would be a mistake to dismiss the possibility of objective  beauty for that sort of reason, for it is none other than the relic of  empiricism that I discussed in Chapter 9 – the assertion that philo- sophical knowledge in general cannot exist. It is true that, just as one  cannot  deduce  moral maxims from scientific theories, likewise nor can  one deduce aesthetic values. But that would not prevent aesthetic truths  from being linked to physical facts through explanations, as moral  ones are. Wheeler was very nearly asserting such a link in that quotation.  Facts can be used to criticize aesthetic theories, as they can moral  theories. For instance, there is the criticism that, since most arts depend  on parochial properties of human senses (such as which range of  colours and sounds they can detect), they cannot be attaining anything  objective. Extraterrestrial people whose senses detected radio waves  but not light or sound would have art that was inaccessible to us, and  vice versa. And the reply to that criticism might be, first, that perhaps  our arts are merely scratching the surface of what is possible: they are  indeed parochial, but they are a first approximation to something  universal. Or, second, that deaf composers on Earth have composed,  and appreciated, great music; why could deaf extraterrestrials (or  humans who were born deaf) not learn to do the same – if by no other  means than by downloading a set of deaf-composer aesthetics into  their brains? Or, third, what is the difference between using radio  telescopes to understand the physics of quasars and using prosthetic  senses (wired into the brain to create new qualia) to appreciate extra- terrestrial art? 355 Why are Flowers Beautiful?  Experience may also provide artistic  problems . Our ancestors had  eyes and paint, which may have led them to wonder how paint could  be used in a way that would look more beautiful. Just as Bronowski pointed out that scientific discovery depends on  a commitment to certain moral values, might it not also entail the  appreciation of certain forms of beauty? It is a fact – often mentioned  but seldom explained – that deep truth is often beautiful. Mathemat- icians and theoretical scientists call this form of beauty ‘elegance’.  Elegance is the beauty in explanations. It is by no means synonymous  with how good, or how true, an explanation is. The poet John Keats’  assertion (which I think was ironic) that ‘Beauty is truth, truth beauty’  is refuted by what the evolutionist Thomas Huxley called ‘the great  tragedy of Science – the slaying of a beautiful hypothesis by an ugly  fact – which is so constantly being enacted under the eyes of philo- sophers’. (By ‘philosophers’ he meant ‘scientists’.) I think Huxley, too  was being ironic in calling this process a great tragedy, especially since  he was referring to the refutation of spontaneous-generation theories.  But it is true that some important mathematical proofs, and some  scientific theories, are far from elegant. Yet the truth so often  is  elegant  that elegance is, at least, a useful heuristic when searching for funda- mental truths. And when a ‘beautiful hypothesis’ is slain, it is more  often than not replaced, as the spontaneous-generation theory was, by  a more beautiful one. Surely this is not coincidence: it is a regularity  in nature. So it must have an explanation. The processes of science and art can look rather different: a new  artistic creation rarely proves an old one wrong; artists rarely look at a  scene through microscopes, or understand a sculpture through equations.  Yet scientific and artistic creation do sometimes look remarkably alike.  Richard Feynman once remarked that the only equipment a theoretical  physicist needs is a stack of paper, a pencil and a waste-paper basket,  and some artists, when they are at work, closely resemble that picture.  Before the invention of the typewriter, novelists used exactly the same  equipment.  Composers like Ludwig van Beethoven agonized through change  after change, apparently seeking something that they knew was there  to be created, apparently meeting a standard that could be met only  after much creative effort and much failure. Scientists often do the  356 the beginning of infinity same. In both science and art there are the exceptional creators like  Mozart or the mathematician Srinivasa Ramanujan, who reputedly  made brilliant contributions without any such effort. But from what  we know of knowledge-creation we have to conclude that in such cases  the effort, and the mistakes, did happen, invisibly, inside their brains. Are these resemblances

 non-physicists  consider it self-evident that when you hold your arm out horizontally  you can  feel  the force of gravity pulling it downwards. But you cannot.  The existence of a force of gravity is, astonishingly, denied by Einstein’s  general theory of relativity, one of the two deepest theories of physics.  This says that the only force on your arm in that situation is that which  you yourself are exerting, upwards, to keep it constantly accelerating  away from the straightest possible path in a curved region of spacetime.  The reality described by our other deepest theory, quantum theory,  which I shall describe in Chapter 11, is even more counter-intuitive.  To understand explanations like those, physicists have to learn to think  about everyday events in new ways.  The guiding principle is, as always, to reject bad explanations in  favour of good ones. In regard to what is or is not real, this leads to  the requirement that, if an entity is referred to by our best explanation  in the relevant field, we must regard it as really existing. And if, as with  the force of gravity, our best explanation denies that it exists, then we  must stop assuming that it does. Furthermore, everyday events are stupendously  complex  when ex    - pressed in terms of fundamental physics. If you fill a kettle with water  and switch it on, all the supercomputers on Earth working for the age  of the universe could not solve the equations that predict what all those  water molecules will do – even if we could somehow determine their  initial state and that of all the outside influences on them, which is  itself an intractable task.  Fortunately, some of that complexity resolves itself into a higher-level  108 the beginning of infinity simplicity. For example, we  can  predict with some accuracy how long  the water will take to boil. To do so, we need know only a few physical  quantities that are quite easy to measure, such as its mass, the power  of the heating element, and so on. For greater accuracy we may also  need information about subtler properties, such as the number and type  of nucleation sites for bubbles. But those are still relatively ‘high-level’  phenomena, composed of intractably large numbers of interacting  atomic-level phenomena. Thus there is a class of high-level phenomena  – including the liquidity of water and the relation        ship between  con  tainers, heating elements, boiling and bubbles – that can be well  explained in terms of each other alone, with no direct reference to  anything at the atomic level or below. In other words, the behaviour of  that whole class of high-level phenomena is  quasi-autonomous  – almost  self-contained. This resolution into explicability at a higher, quasi- autonomous level is known as  emergence . Emergent phenomena are a tiny minority. We can predict when the  water will boil, and that bubbles will form when it does, but if you  wanted to predict where each bubble will go (or, to be precise, what  the probabilities of its various possible motions are – see Chapter 11),  you would be out of luck. Still less is it feasible to predict the countless  microscopically defined properties of the water, such as whether an  odd or an even number of its electrons will be affected by the heating  during a given period. Fortunately, we are uninterested in predicting or explaining most of  those properties, despite the fact that they are the overwhelming  majority. That is because none of them has any bearing on what we  want to do with the water – such as understand what it is made of, or  make tea. To make tea, we want the water to be boiling, but we    do not care what the pattern of bubbles was. We want its volume    to be between a certain minimum and maximum, but we do not    care how many molecules that is. We can make progress in achieving  those purposes because we can express them in terms of those quasi- autonomous emergent properties about which we have good high-level  explanations. Nor do we need most of the microscopic details in order  to understand the role of water in the cosmic scheme of things, because  nearly all of those details are parochial. The behaviour of high-level physical quantities consists of nothing  109 The Reality of Abstractions but the behaviour of their low-level constituents with most of the details  ignored. This has given rise to a widespread misconception about  emergence and explanation, known as  reductionism : the doctrine that  science always explains and predicts things reductively, i.e. by analysing  them into components. Often it does, as when we use the fact that  inter-atomic forces obey the law of conservation of energy to make  and explain a high-level prediction that the kettle cannot boil water  without a power supply. But reductionism requires the relationship  between different levels of explanation  always  to be like that, and often  it is not. For example, as I wrote in  The Fabric of Reality : Consider one

 begin  new lives as separate people, or they may merge with their originals.  The latter option violates the principle of the conservation of mass,  among other laws of physics. But, again, this is fiction. Nevertheless, there is a certain category of rather pedantic science  fiction enthusiasts, myself included, who prefer the fictional science to  make sense – to consist of reasonably good explanations. Imagining  worlds with different laws of physics is one thing; imagining worlds  that do not make sense in their own terms is quite another. For instance,  we want to know how it can be that the exiles can see and hear the  ordinary world but not touch it. This attitude of ours was nicely  parodied in an episode of the television series  The Simpsons , in which  fans of a fantasy-adventure series question its star: 260 the beginning of infinity star: Next question. fan: Yes, over here. [ Clears throat .] In episode BF12, you were battling  barbarians while riding a wingèd Appaloosa, yet in the very next scene,  my dear, you’re clearly atop a wingèd Arabian. Please to explain it. star: Ah, yeah, well, whenever you notice something like that, a wizard  did it. fan: I see, all right, yes, but in episode AG4 – star: [ firmly ] Wizard. fan: Aw, for glayvin* out loud! Because that is a parody, the fan is complaining not about the story  itself, but only that there is a  continuity error : two horses were used  at different times to play the role of a single fictional horse. Neverthe- less, there are such things as flawed stories. Consider, for instance, a  story about a quest to discover whether winged horses are real, in  which the characters pursue that quest on winged horses. Though  logically consistent, such a story would not make sense in its own  terms, as an explanation. One could embed it in a context that would  make sense of it – for instance, it could be part of an allegory about  how people often fail to see the meaning of what is right there in front  of them. But in that case any merit in the story would still depend on  how the characters’ apparently nonsensical behaviour was  explicable   in terms of that allegory. Compare that with the explanation that ‘a  wizard did it.’ Since a wizard could equally well have been said to  conjure  any  events, in  any  story, it is a bad explanation; and that is  why the fan is exasperated by it.  In some stories the plot is not important: the story is really about  something else. But a good plot always rests, implicitly or explicitly,  on good explanations of how and why events happen, given its fictional  premises. In that case, even if those premises are about wizards, the  story is not really about the supernatural: it is about imaginary laws  of physics and imaginary societies, as well as real problems and true  ideas. As I shall explain in Chapter 14, not only do all good science- fiction plots resemble scientific explanation in this way, in the broadest  sense all good art does.  In that spirit, then, consider the fictional  doppelgänger s in the  *‘Glayvin’ is a term of indeterminate meaning, coined by  The Simpsons . 261 The Multiverse phantom zone. What enables them to  see  the ordinary world? Since  they are structurally identical to their originals, their eyes work by  absorbing light and detecting the resulting chemical changes, just as  real eyes do. But if they absorb some of the light coming from the  ordinary world, then they must cast shadows at the places where that  light would otherwise have arrived. Also, if the exiles in the phantom  zone can see each other, what light are they seeing with? The phantom  zone’s own light? If so, where does it come from? On the other hand, if the exiles can see  without  absorbing light,  then they must be differently constituted from their originals, at the  microscopic level. And in that case we no longer have an explanation  of why they outwardly resemble their originals: the ‘accidental-copying’  idea will no longer do: where did the transporter get the knowledge  required to build things that look and behave like human bodies, but  function internally in a different way? It would be a case of spontaneous  generation. Similarly, is there air in the phantom zone? If the exiles breathe air,  it can’t be the ship’s air, because they would be heard speaking or even  breathing. But nor can it be a copy of the small amount of air that was  in the transporter with them, because they are free to move around the  ship. So there must be a whole shipful of phantom-zone air. But then  what is preventing it from expanding out into space?  It seems that almost everything that happens in the story not only  conflicts with the real laws of physics (which is unexceptionable in  fiction), but raises problems within the fictional explanation. If the  doppelgängers  can walk through people, why do they not fall through  the floor? In reality, a floor supports people by bending slightly. But if  it were to bend in the

 the profound  difference   between our civilization and civilizations like the one that built those  421 Unsustainable statues.  We are not like them  was his message. We have taken the step  that they did not. Attenborough’s argument rests on the opposite claim:  we are like them  and are following headlong in their footsteps. And  so he drew an extended analogy between the Easter Island civilization  and ours, feature for feature, and danger for danger: A warning of what the future could hold can be seen on one of the  remotest places on Earth . . . When the first Polynesian settlers landed  here they found a miniature world that had ample resources to sustain  them. They lived well . . . The State of the Planet  (BBC TV, 2000) A miniature world : there, in three words, is Attenborough’s reason  for travelling all the way to Easter Island and telling its story. He  believed that it holds a warning for the world because Easter Island  was itself a miniature world – a Spaceship Earth – that went wrong.  It had ‘ample resources’ to sustain its population, just as the Earth has  seemingly ample resources to sustain us. (Imagine how amazed Malthus  would have been had he known that the Earth’s resources would still  be called ‘ample’ by pessimists in the year 2000.) Its inhabitants ‘lived  well’, just as we do. And yet they were doomed, just as we are doomed  unless we change our ways. If we do not, here is ‘what the future could  hold’: The old culture that had sustained them was abandoned and the statues  toppled. What had been a rich, fertile world in miniature had become a  barren desert. Again, Attenborough puts in a good word for the old culture: it  ‘sustained’ the islanders (just as the ample resources did, until the  islanders failed to use them  sustainably ). He uses the toppling of the  statues to symbolize the fall of that culture, as if to warn of future  disaster for ours, and he reiterates his world-in-miniature analogy  between the society and technology of ancient Easter Island and that  of our whole planet today.  Thus Attenborough’s Easter Island is a variant of Spaceship Earth:  humans are sustained  jointly  by the ‘rich, fertile’ biosphere  and  the  cultural knowledge of a static society. In this context, ‘sustain’ is an  interestingly ambiguous word. It can mean providing someone with  422 the beginning of infinity what they need. But it can also mean preventing things from changing  – which can be almost the opposite meaning, for the suppression of  change is seldom what human beings need.  The knowledge that currently sustains human life in Oxfordshire  does so only in the first sense: it does not make us enact the same,  traditional way of life in every generation. In fact it prevents us from  doing so. For comparison: if your way of life merely makes you build  a new, giant statue, you can continue to live afterwards exactly as you  did before. That is  sustainable . But if your way of life leads you to  invent a more efficient method of farming, and to cure a disease that  has been killing many children, that is  unsustainable . The population  grows because children who would have died survive; meanwhile,  fewer of them are needed to work in the fields. And so there is no way  to continue as before. You have to live the solution, and to set about  solving the new problems that this creates. It is because of this unsus- tainability that the island of Britain, with a far less hospitable climate  than the subtropical Easter Island, now hosts a civilization with at  least three times the population density that Easter Island had at its  zenith, and at an enormously higher standard of living. Appropriately  enough, this civilization has knowledge of how to live well without  the forests that once covered much of Britain.  The Easter Islanders’ culture sustained them in both senses. This is  the hallmark of a functioning static society. It provided them with a  way of life; but it also inhibited change: it sustained their determination  to enact and re-enact the same behaviours for generations. It sustained  the values that placed forests – literally – beneath statues. And it  sustained the shapes of those statues, and the pointless project of  building ever more of them.  Moreover, the portion of the culture that sustained them in the sense  of providing for their needs was not especially impressive. Other Stone  Age societies have managed to take fish from the sea and sow crops  without wasting their efforts in endless monument-building. And, if the  prevailing theory is true, the Easter Islanders started to starve  before  the  fall of their civilization. In other words, even after it had stopped providing  for them, it retained its fatal proficiency at sustaining a fixed pattern of  behaviour. And so it remained effective at preventing them from addressing  the problem by the only means that could possibly have been effective:  423 Unsustainable creative thought and innovation.

From the least parochial perspectives available to us,  people  are the  most significant entities in the cosmic scheme of things. They are not  ‘supported’ by their environments, but support themselves by creating  knowledge. Once they have suitable knowledge (essentially, the know- ledge of the Enlightenment), they are capable of sparking unlimited  further progress. Apart from the thoughts of people, the only process known to be  77 The Spark capable of creating knowledge is biological evolution. The knowledge  it creates (other than via people) is inherently bounded and parochial.  Yet it also has close similarities with human knowledge. The similarities  and the differences are the subject of the next chapter. 78 4 Creation The knowledge in human brains and the knowledge in biological  adaptations are both created by  evolution  in the broad sense: the  variation of existing information, alternating with selection. In the  case of human knowledge, the variation is by conjecture, and the  selection is by criticism and experiment. In the biosphere, the variation  consists of mutations (random changes) in genes, and natural selection  favours the variants that most improve the ability of their organisms  to reproduce, thus causing those variant genes to spread through    the population.  That a gene is  adapted  to a given function means that few, if any,  small changes would improve its ability to perform that function. Some  changes might make no practical difference to that ability, but most  of those that did would make it worse. In other words good adaptations,  like good explanations, are distinguished by being hard to vary while  still fulfilling their functions. Human brains and DNA molecules each have many functions, but  among other things they are general-purpose information-storage  media: they are in principle capable of storing any kind of information.  Moreover, the two types of information that they respectively evolved  to store have a property of cosmic significance in common:  once they  are physically  embodied in a suitable environment, they tend to cause  themselves to remain so . Such information – which I call  knowledge   – is very unlikely to come into existence other than through the error- correcting processes of evolution or thought.  There are also important differences between those two kinds of  knowledge. One is that biological knowledge is non-explanatory, and  therefore has limited reach; explanatory human knowledge can have  79 Creation broad or even unlimited reach. Another difference is that mutations  are random, while conjectures can be constructed intentionally for a  purpose. Nevertheless, the two kinds of knowledge share enough of  their underlying logic for the theory of evolution to be highly relevant  to human knowledge. In particular, some historic misconceptions    about biological evolution have counterparts in misconceptions about    human knowledge. So in this chapter I shall describe some of those  misconceptions in addition to the actual explanation of biological  adaptations, namely modern Darwinian evolutionary theory, sometimes  known as ‘neo-Darwinism’. Creationism Creationism is the idea that some supernatural being or beings designed  and created all biological adaptations. In other words, ‘the gods did  it.’ As I explained in Chapter 1, theories of that form are bad ex    - planations. Unless supplemented by hard-to-vary specifics, they do not  even address the problem – just as ‘the laws of physics did it’ will never  win you a Nobel prize, and ‘the conjurer did it’ does not solve the  mystery of the conjuring trick.  Before a conjuring trick is ever performed, its explanation must be  known to the person who invented it. The origin of that knowledge is  the origin of the trick. Similarly, the problem of explaining the biosphere  is that of explaining how the knowledge embodied in its adaptations  could possibly have been created. In particular, a putative designer of  any

 contrary,  it wiped them out because they  were  living the lifestyles that they  had evolved to live, and in which, according to the Spaceship Earth  metaphor, the biosphere had been ‘supporting’ them.  Yet that still overstates the degree to which the biosphere is hospitable  to humans in particular. The first people to live at the latitude of Oxford  (who were actually from a species related to us, possibly the Neanderthals)  50 the beginning of infinity could do so only because they brought knowledge with them, about  such things as tools, weapons, fire and clothing. That knowledge was  transmitted from generation to generation not genetically but culturally.  Our pre-human ancestors in the Great Rift Valley used such know-  ledge too, and our own species must have come into existence already  dependent on it for survival. As evidence of that, note that I would soon  die if I tried to live in the Great Rift Valley in its primeval state: I do  not have the requisite knowledge. Since then, there have been human  populations who, for instance, knew how to survive in the Amazon  jungle but not in the Arctic, and populations for whom it was the other  way round. Therefore that knowledge was not part of their genetic  inheritance. It was created by human thought, and preserved and  transmitted in human culture. Today, almost the entire capacity of the Earth’s ‘life-support system  for humans’ has been provided not  for  us but  by  us, using our ability  to create new knowledge. There are people in the Great Rift Valley  today who live far more comfortably than early humans did, and in  far greater numbers, through knowledge of things like tools, farming  and hygiene. The Earth did provide the raw materials for our survival  – just as the sun has provided the energy, and supernovae provided the  elements, and so on. But a heap of raw materials is not the same thing  as a life-support system. It takes knowledge to convert the one into  the other, and biological evolution never provided us with enough  knowledge to survive, let alone to thrive. In this respect we differ from  almost all other species. They do have all the knowledge that they need,  genetically encoded in their brains. And that knowledge was indeed  provided for them by evolution – and so, in the relevant sense, ‘by the  biosphere’. So  their  home environments do have the appearance of  having been designed as life-support systems for them, albeit only in  the desperately limited sense that I have described. But the biosphere  no more provides humans with a life-support system than it provides  us with radio telescopes. So the biosphere is incapable of supporting human life. From the  outset, it was only human knowledge that made the planet even  marginally habitable by humans, and the enormously increased capacity  of our life-support system since then (in terms both of numbers and  of security and quality of life) has been entirely due to the creation of  51 The Spark human knowledge. To the extent that we are on a ‘spaceship’, we have  never been merely its passengers, nor (as is often said) its stewards, nor  even its maintenance crew: we are its designers and builders. Before  the designs created by humans, it was not a vehicle, but only a heap  of dangerous raw materials. The ‘passengers’ metaphor is a misconception in another sense too.  It implies that there was a time when humans lived unproblematically:  when they were provided for, like pas    sengers, without themselves  having to solve a stream of problems in order to survive and to thrive.  But in fact, even with the benefit of their cultural knowledge, our  ancestors continually faced desperate problems, such as where the  next meal was coming from, and typically they barely solved these  problems or they died. There are very few fossils of old people. The moral component of the Spaceship Earth metaphor is therefore  somewhat paradoxical. It casts humans as ungrateful for gifts which,  in reality, they never received. And it casts all other species in morally  positive roles in the spaceship’s life-support system, with humans as  the only negative actors. But humans are part of the biosphere, and  the supposedly immoral behaviour is identical to what all other species  do when times are good – except that humans alone try to mitigate the  effect of that response on their descendants and on other species.  The Principle of Mediocrity is paradoxical too. Since it singles out  anthropocentrism for special opprobrium among all forms of parochial  misconception, it is itself anthropocentric. Also, it claims that all value  judgements are anthropocentric, yet it itself is often expressed in value- laden terminology, such as ‘arrogance’, ‘just scum’ and the very word  ‘mediocrity’. With respect to whose values are those disparagements  to be understood? Why is arrogance even relevant as a criticism? Also,  even if holding an arrogant opinion is morally wrong, morality is  supposed to

 structure. We do not discover new facts or new effects by copying them,  or by inferring them inductively from observation, or by any other  method of instruction by the environment. We use, rather, the method  412 the beginning of infinity of trial and the elimination of error. As Ernst Gombrich says, ‘making  comes before matching’: the active production of a new trial structure  comes before its exposure to eliminating tests. The Myth of the Framework Popper could just as well have written, ‘We do not  acquire new memes   by copying them, or by inferring them inductively from observation,  or by any other method of imitation of, or instruction by, the environ- ment.’ The transmission of human-type memes – memes whose meaning  is not mostly predefined within the receiver – cannot be other than a  creative activity on the part of the receiver. Memes, like scientific theories, are not derived from anything. They  are created afresh by the recipient. They are conjectural explanations,  which are then subjected to criticism and testing before being tentatively  adopted. This same pattern of creative conjecture, criticism and testing generates  inexplicit as well as explicit ideas. In fact all creativity does, for no    idea can be represented entirely explicitly. When we make an explicit  conjecture, it has an inexplicit component whether we are aware of it  or not. And so does all criticism. Thus, as has so often happened in the history of universality, the human  capacity for universal explanation did not evolve to have a universal  function. It evolved simply to increase the volume of memetic information  that our ancestors could acquire, and the speed and accuracy which they  could acquire it. But since the easiest way for evolution to do that was  to give us a universal ability to explain, through creativity, that is what  it did. This epistemological fact provides not only the solution of the  two puzzles I mentioned, but also the reason for the evolution of human  creativity – and therefore the human species – in the first place.  It must have happened something like this. In early pre-human  societies, there were only very simple memes – the kind that apes now  have, though perhaps with a wider repertoire of copiable elementary  behaviours. Those memes were about practical things like how to get  food that was otherwise inaccessible. The value of such knowledge  must have been high, so this created a ready-made niche for any  adaptation that would reduce the effort required to replicate memes.  Creativity was the ultimate adaptation to fill that niche. As it increased,  413 The Evolution of Creativity further adaptations co-evolved, such as an increase in memory capacity  (to store more memes), finer motor control, and specialized brain  structures for dealing with language. As a result, the meme band-  width (the amount of memetic information that could be passed from    each generation to the next) increased too. Memes also became more  complex and sophisticated. This is why and how our species evolved, and why it evolved rapidly  – at first. Memes gradually came to dominate our ancestors’ behaviour.  Meme evolution took place, and, like all evolution, this was always in  the direction of greater faithfulness. This meant becoming ever more  anti-rational. At some point, meme evolution achieved static societies  – presumably they were tribes. Consequently, all those increases in  creativity never produced streams of innovations. Innovation remained  imperceptibly slow, even as the capacity for it was increasing rapidly. Even in a static society, memes still evolve, due to imperceptible  errors of replication. They just evolve more slowly than anyone can  notice: imperceptible errors cannot be suppressed. They would generally  evolve towards greater fidelity of replication, as usual with evolution,  and hence to greater staticity of the society. Status in such a society is reduced by transgressing people’s ex    - pectations of proper behaviour, and is improved by meeting them.  There would have been the expectations of parents, priests, chiefs and  potential mates (or whoever controlled mating in that society) – who  were themselves conforming to the wishes and expectations of the  society at large. Those people’s opinions would determine one’s ability  to eat, thrive and reproduce, and hence the fate of one’s genes. But how does one discover the wishes and expectations of other  people? They might issue commands, but they could never specify every  detail of what they expected, let alone every detail of how to achieve  it. When one is commanded to do something (or expected to, as a  condition for being considered worthy of food or mating, for instance),  one might remember seeing an already-respected person doing the  same thing, and one might try to emulate that person. To do that  effectively, one would have to understand what the point of doing it  was, and to try to achieve  that  as best one

On the other hand, if the exiles can see  without  absorbing light,  then they must be differently constituted from their originals, at the  microscopic level. And in that case we no longer have an explanation  of why they outwardly resemble their originals: the ‘accidental-copying’  idea will no longer do: where did the transporter get the knowledge  required to build things that look and behave like human bodies, but  function internally in a different way? It would be a case of spontaneous  generation. Similarly, is there air in the phantom zone? If the exiles breathe air,  it can’t be the ship’s air, because they would be heard speaking or even  breathing. But nor can it be a copy of the small amount of air that was  in the transporter with them, because they are free to move around the  ship. So there must be a whole shipful of phantom-zone air. But then  what is preventing it from expanding out into space?  It seems that almost everything that happens in the story not only  conflicts with the real laws of physics (which is unexceptionable in  fiction), but raises problems within the fictional explanation. If the  doppelgängers  can walk through people, why do they not fall through  the floor? In reality, a floor supports people by bending slightly. But if  it were to bend in the

 experience and of classical physics, plus some apparently  random jiggling whenever the transporter operates. A tiny minority of  the histories have been significantly affected by very ‘unlikely’ events,  but even in those the information  flow  – what affects what – is still very  tame and familiar. For instance, a version of the ship’s log that contains  records of bizarre coincidences will be perceptible to people who  remember those coincidences, but not to other instances of those people.  Thus the information in the fictional multiverse flows along a  branching tree, whose branches – histories – have different thicknesses  (measures) and never rejoin once they have separated. Each behaves  exactly as if the others did not exist. If that were the whole story, that  multiverse’s imaginary laws of physics would still be fatally flawed as  explanations in the same way that they have been all along: there would  be no difference between their predictions and those of much more  straightforward laws saying that there is only one universe – one history  – in which the transporter  randomly  introduces a change in the objects  that it teleports. Under those laws, instead of branching into two  autonomous histories on such occasions, the single history randomly  does or does not undergo such a change. Thus the entire stupendously  complicated multiverse that we have imagined – with its multiplicity  of entities including people walking through each other and its bizarre  occurrences and its entanglement information – would collapse into  nothing, like the galaxy in Chapter 2 that became an emulsion flaw.  The multiverse explanation of the same events would be a bad  *That this information is carried entirely locally in objects is currently somewhat  controversial. For a detailed technical discussion see the paper ‘Information Flow in  Entangled Quantum Systems’ by myself and Patrick Hayden ( Proceedings of the Royal  Society  A456 (2000)). 282 the beginning of infinity explanation, and so the world would be inexplicable to the inhabitants  if it were true. It may seem that, by imposing all those conditions on information  flow, we have gone to a lot of trouble to achieve that very attribute – to  hide, from the inhabitants, the Byzantine intricacies of their world. In  the words of Lewis Carroll’s White Knight in  Through the Looking  Glass , it is as if we were . . . thinking of a plan   To dye one’s whiskers green, And always use so large a fan   That they could not be seen. Now it is time to start removing the fan. In quantum physics, information flow in the multiverse is not as  tame as in that branching tree of histories I have described. That is  because of one further quantum phenomenon: under certain circum- stances, the laws of motion allow histories to rejoin (becoming fungible  again). This is the time-reverse of the splitting (differentiation of history  into two or more histories) that I have already described, so a natural  way to implement it in our fictional multiverse is for the transporter  to be capable of undoing its own history-splitting. If we represent the original splitting like this where  X  is the normal voltage and  Y  is the anomalous one introduced  by the transporter, then the rejoining of histories can be represented as In an interference phenomenon, differentiated histories rejoin. X X Y ය interference X Y X ය 283 The Multiverse This phenomenon is known as  interference : the presence of the  Y- history  interferes  with what the transporter usually does to an  X -history.  Instead, the  X  and  Y  histories merge. This is  rather like  the doppelgängers  merging with their originals in some phantom-zone stories, except that  here we do not need to repeal the principle of the conservation of mass  or any other conservation law: the total measure of all the histories  remains constant.  Interference is the phenomenon that can provide the inhabitants of  the multiverse with evidence of the existence of multiple histories in  their world without allowing the histories to communicate. For example,  suppose that they run the transporter twice in quick succession (I shall  explain in a moment what ‘quick’ means):  An interference experiment If they did this repeatedly (with, say, different copies of the transporter  on each occasion), they could soon infer that the intermediate result  could not  be just randomly  X  or  Y , because if it were then the final  outcome would sometimes be  Y  (because of     ), while in fact it is  always  X . Thus the inhabitants would no longer be able to explain  away what they see by assuming that only one, randomly chosen, value  of the voltage is real at the intermediate stage. Although such an experiment would provide evidence that multiple  histories not only exist but affect each other strongly (in the sense that  they behave differently according to whether the other is present or  absent), it does not involve inter-history  communication

 in evidence. We happened to get round to  testing Newton’s laws in the seventeenth century, and Einstein’s in the  twentieth, but the evidence with which we did that – light from the  sky – had been deluging the surface of the Earth for billions of years  before that, and will continue to do so for billions more. Even today  we have barely begun to examine that evidence: on any clear night,  the chances are that your roof will be struck by evidence falling from  the sky which, if you only knew what to look for and how, would    win you a Nobel prize. In chemistry, every stable element that exists  62 the beginning of infinity anywhere is also present on or just below the Earth’s surface. In biology,  copious evidence of the nature of life is ubiquitous in the biosphere  – and within arm’s reach, in our own DNA. As far as we know,    all the fundamental constants of nature can be measured here, and    every fundamental law can be tested here. Everything needed for the    open-ended creation of knowledge is here in abundance, in the Earth’s  biosphere.  And the same is true of the moon. It has essentially the same resources  of mass, energy and evidence as the Earth has. Parochial details differ,  but the fact that humans living on the moon will have to make their  own air is no more significant than the fact that laboratories on Earth  have to make their own vacuum. Both tasks can be automated so as to  require arbitrarily little human effort or attention. Likewise, because  humans are universal constructors,  every  problem of finding or trans- form    ing resources can be no more than a transient factor limiting the  creation of knowledge in a given environment. And therefore matter,  energy and evidence are the only requirements that an environment  needs to have in order to be a venue for open-ended knowledge creation. Though any particular problem is a transient factor, the condition  of having to solve problems in order to survive and continue to create  knowledge is permanent. I have mentioned that there has never been  an unproblematic time for humans; that applies as much to the future  as to the past. Today on Earth, in the short run, there are still countless  problems to be solved to eliminate even starvation and other forms of  extreme human suffering that date back to prehistory. On a timescale  of decades, we shall be faced with choices to make substantial modifi- cations to the biosphere, or to keep it the same, or anything in between.  Whichever option we choose, it will be a project of planet-wide control,  requiring the creation of a great deal of scientific and tech  nological  knowledge as well as knowledge about how to make such decisions  rationally (see Chapter 13). In the even longer run, it is not only our  comfort and aesthetic sensibilities, and the suffering of individ  uals,  that are problematic, but, as always, the survival of our species. For  instance, at present during any given century there is about one chance  in a thousand that the Earth will be struck by a comet or asteroid large  enough to kill at least a substantial proportion of all human beings.  That means that a typical child born in the United States today is more  63 The Spark likely to die as a result of an astronomical event than a car accident.  Both are very low-probability events, but, unless we create a great deal  more scientific and technological knowledge than we have now, we  shall have no defence against those and other forms of natural disaster  that must, eventually, strike. Arguably there are more immediate  existential threats too – see Chapter 9. Setting up self-sufficient colonies on the moon and elsewhere in the  solar system – and eventually in other solar systems – will be a good  hedge against the extinction of our species or the destruction of civil- ization, and is a highly desirable goal for that reason among others.  As Hawking has said: I don’t think the human race will survive the next thousand years, unless  we spread into space. There are too many accidents that can befall life  on a single planet. But I’m an optimist. We will reach out to the stars. Daily Telegraph , 16 October 2001 But even that will be far from an unproblematic state. And most people  are not satisfied merely to be confident in the survival of the  species :  they want to survive personally. Also, like our earliest human ancestors,  they want to be free from physical danger and suffering. In future, as  various causes of suffering and death such as disease and ageing are  successively addressed and eliminated, and human life spans increase,  people will care about ever longer-term risks.  In fact people will always want still more than that: they will want  to make progress. For, in addition to threats, there will always be  problems in the benign sense of the word: errors, gaps, inconsistencies  and inadequacies in our knowledge that we wish to solve – including,  not least, moral knowledge: knowledge about

 things; and The Earth’s biosphere is  incapable  of supporting human life. Consider Hawking’s remark again. It is true that we are on a  (somewhat)  typical planet of a typical star in a typical galaxy. But we  are far from typical of the matter in the universe. For one thing, about  46 the beginning of infinity 80 per cent of that matter is thought to be invisible ‘dark matter’, which  can neither emit nor absorb light. We currently detect it only through  its indirect gravitational effects on galaxies. Only the remaining 20 per  cent is matter of the type that we parochially call ‘ordinary matter’. It  is characterized by glowing continuously. We do not usually think of  ourselves as glowing, but that is another parochial misconception, due  to the limitations of our senses: we emit radiant heat, which is infra- red light, and also light in the visible range, too faint for our eyes    to detect. Concentrations of matter as dense as ourselves and our planet and  star, though numerous, are not exactly typical either. They are isolated,  uncommon phenomena. The universe is mostly vacuum (plus radiation  and dark matter). Ordinary matter is familiar to us only because we  are made of it, and because of our untypical location near large  concentrations of it.  Moreover, we are an uncommon form of ordinary matter. The  commonest form is plasma (atoms dissociated into their electrically  charged components), which typically emits bright, visible light because  it is in stars, which are rather hot. We scums are mainly infra-red  emitters because we contain liquids and complex chemicals which can  exist only at a much lower range of temperatures.  The universe is pervaded with microwave radiation – the afterglow  of the Big Bang. Its temperature is about 2.7 kelvin, which means 2.7  degrees above the coldest possible temperature, absolute zero, or about  270 degrees Celsius colder than the freezing point of water. Only very  unusual circumstances can make anything colder than those micro- waves. Nothing in the universe is known to be cooler than about  one  kelvin – except in certain physics laboratories on Earth. There, the  record low temperature achieved is below one  billionth  of a kelvin. At  those extraordinary temperatures, the glow of ordinary matter is  effectively extinguished. The resulting ‘non-glowing ordinary matter’  on our planet is an exceedingly exotic substance in the universe at  large. It may well be that the interiors of refrigerators constructed by  physicists are by far the coldest and darkest places in the universe. Far  from typical. What is a typical place in the universe like? Let me assume that you  are reading this on Earth. In your mind’s eye, travel straight upwards  47 The Spark a few hundred kilometres. Now you are in the slightly more typical  environment of space. But you are still being heated and illuminated  by the sun, and half your field of view is still taken up by the solids,  liquids and scums of the Earth. A typical location has none of those  features. So, travel a few trillion kilometres further in the same direction.  You are now so far away that the sun looks like other stars. You are  at a much colder, darker and emptier place, with no scum in sight. But  it is not yet typical: you are still inside the Milky Way galaxy, and most  places in the universe are not in any galaxy. Continue until you are  clear outside the galaxy – say, a hundred thousand light years from  Earth. At this distance you could not glimpse the Earth even if you  used the most powerful telescope that humans have yet built. But the  Milky Way still fills much of your sky. To get to a typical place in the  universe, you have to imagine yourself at least a thousand times as far  out as that, deep in intergalactic space. What is it like there? Imagine the whole of space notionally divided  into cubes the size of our solar system. If you were observing from a  typical one of them, the sky would be pitch black. The nearest star  would be so far away that if it were to explode as a supernova, and  you were staring directly at it when its light reached you, you would  not see even a glimmer. That is how big and dark the universe is.    And it is cold: it is at that background temperature of 2.7 kelvin,    which is cold enough to freeze every known substance except helium.  (Helium is believed to remain liquid right down to absolute zero, unless    highly pressurized.) And it is empty: the density of atoms out there is below one per cubic  metre. That is a million times sparser than atoms in the space between  the stars, and those atoms are themselves sparser than in the best  vacuum that human technology has yet achieved. Almost all the atoms  in intergalactic space are hydrogen or helium, so there is no chemistry.  No life could have evolved there, nor any intelligence. Nothing changes  there. Nothing happens. The same is true of the next cube and the next,  and if you were to examine a million

 belief when I asked whether you are sure that I am before  your eyes. I was only questioning how you can claim to be ‘seeing  clearly’ what is before your eyes when you also claim to be asleep! socrates:  Oh! Yes, you have caught me in an error – but surely only  a trivial one. Indeed, you may not be literally before my eyes. Perhaps  you are at home on Olympus, sending me a mere likeness of yourself.  But in that case you are controlling that likeness and I am seeing it,  and referring to it as ‘you’, so I am seeing ‘you’. hermes:  But that is not what I asked. I asked what is here  before your  eyes . In reality. socrates:  All right. Before my eyes, in reality, there is – a small room.  Or, if you want a literal reply, what is before my eyes is – eyelids,  since I expect that they are shut. Yet I see from your expression that  you want even more precision. Very well: before my eyes are the  inside surfaces  of my eyelids. hermes:  And can you see those? In other words, is it really ‘easy to  see’ what is before your eyes? 228 the beginning of infinity socrates:  Not at the moment. But that is only because I am dream- ing.  hermes: Is it  only  because you are dreaming? Are you saying that if  you were awake you would now be seeing the inside surfaces of  your eyelids?  socrates: [ carefully ] If I were awake with my eyes still closed, then  yes.  hermes:  What  colour  do you see when you close your eyes? socrates: In a  room as dimly lit as this one – black. hermes: Do  you think that the inside surfaces of your eyelids are  black? socrates: I  suppose not.  hermes: So  would you really be seeing them? socrates:  Not exactly.  hermes:  And if you were to open your eyes, would you be able to  see the room? socrates:  Only very vaguely. It is dark. hermes: So I  ask again: is it true that, if you were awake, you could  easily see what was before your eyes? socrates:  All right – not always. But nevertheless, when I am awake,  and with my eyes open,  and  in bright light – hermes:  But not  too  bright, I suppose? socrates: Yes,  yes. If you want to keep quibbling, I must accept that  when one is dazzled by the sun one may see even less well than in  the dark. Likewise one may see one’s own face behind a mirror where  there is in reality only empty space. One may sometimes see a mirage,  or be fooled by a pile of crumpled clothes that happens to resemble  a mythical creature – hermes: Or  one may be fooled by dreaming of one . . . socrates: [ Smiles. ] Quite so. And, conversely, whether sleeping or  waking, we often  fail  to see things that  are  there in reality. hermes: You  have no idea how many such things there are . . . socrates: No  doubt. But still, when one is  not  dreaming, and  conditions are  good  for seeing – hermes:  And how can you tell whether ‘conditions are good’ for  seeing? socrates:  Ah! Now you are trying to catch me in a circularity. You  229 A Dream of Socrates want me to say that one can tell that conditions are good for seeing  when one can easily see what is there.  hermes: I  want you  not  to say so.  socrates: It  seems to me that you have been asking questions about  me  – what is in front of me, what I can easily see, whether I am sure,  and so on. But I seek fundamental truths, of which I estimate that  not a single one is predominantly about me. So let me stress again:  I am  not  sure what is in front of my eyes – ever – with my eyes open  or closed, asleep or awake. Nor can I be sure what is  probably  in  front of my eyes, for how could I estimate the probability that I am  dreaming when I think I am awake? Or that my whole previous life  has been but a dream in which it has pleased one of you immortals  to imprison me?  hermes:  Indeed. socrates: I  might even be a victim of a mundane deception, such as  those of conjurers. We know that a conjurer is deceiving us because  he shows us something that cannot be – and then asks for money!  But if he were to forgo his fee and show me something that  can  be  but is not, how could I ever know? Perhaps this entire vision of you  is not a dream after all but some cunning conjurer’s trick. On the  other hand, perhaps you really are here in person and I am awake  after all. None of this can I ever be  sure  is so, or not so. I can, however,  conceive of  knowing  some of it . hermes:  Precisely. And is the same true of your  moral  knowledge? In  regard to what is right and wrong, could you be mistaken, or misled,  by the equivalent of mirages or tricks? socrates:  That seems harder to imagine. For in regard to moral  knowledge I need my senses very little: it is mainly just my own  thoughts. I  reason  about what is right and wrong, or what makes a  person virtuous or wicked. I can be mistaken, of course, in these  mental deliberations, but not so easily  deceived  by outside tricks or  illusions, for they affect only our senses and not our reason. hermes: How,  then, do you account for the fact that you Athenians  are

Well,  the Spartan half of the riddle is easy: Sparta glories in  war . And she  values all the associated virtues such as courage, endurance and so on. [ The other  companions  of Socrates murmur their assent .] We, on the other hand – well, we value  everything , don’t we! Every- thing good, that is. companion no. 1:  Everything good? That seems a bit circular, Plato,  unless you’re going to define ‘good’ in some way that’s independent  of ‘what we Athenians value’. I think I can put it more elegantly:  fighting , versus  having something to fight for . companion no. 2:  Nice. But that’s basically ‘War versus Philosophy’,  isn’t it? plato : [ taking mock offence ] And  poetry . companion no. 3:  Could it be that Athens, whose patron deity is  female, represents the creative spirit in the world, while Sparta  favours Ares, the god of bloodlust and slaughter, whom Athena  defeated and humbled –  plato : No, no, they’re actually not that keen on Ares. They prefer  Artemis. And, strangely enough, they also revere Athena. Did you  know that? chaerephon:  Speaking as an Athenian who is older than all of you  and who has seen plenty of war, may I just say that it seems to me  that Athens, despite all its glorious martial achievements, would be  just as happy to lead a quiet life and be friends with all the Greeks,  and not least with the Spartans. But unfortunately the Spartans like  nothing better than to annoy us whenever they possibly can. Though  247 A Dream of Socrates I must admit that in that respect they are not especially worse than  anyone else. Including our allies! socrates:  Those are very interesting conjectures, all of which I think  do capture aspects of the differences between the cities. And yet I  suspect – and I may of course be mistaken – plato : A Spartan Socrates wouldn’t be  modest . Is that the difference? socrates: No.  (By the way, I think that if anything, he  would  be.)      I suspect that we have all been labouring under a misconception  about Sparta. Could it be that the Spartans do not seek war, as  such, at all? At least, not since they conquered their neighbours,  centuries ago, and made them helots. Perhaps, since then, they have  acquired an entirely different concern that is of overriding  importance to them; and perhaps they fight  only  when that concern  is under threat.  companion no. 2:  What is it? Keeping the helots down? socrates: No,  that would be only a means, not the end in itself. I  think that the god told me what their overarching concern is. And  he also told me what ours is – though alas  we  also fight for all sorts  of other reasons, of which we often repent.     Those two overarching concerns are these: we Athenians are con  - cerned above all with  improvement ; the Spartans seek only –  stasis .  Two opposite objectives. If you think about it, I believe you’ll soon  agree that  this  is the single source of all the myriad differences  between the two cities. plato : I never thought of it that way before, but I think I do agree.  Let me try out the theory. Here’s one difference between the cities:  Sparta has no philosophers. That’s because the job of a philosopher  is to understand things better, which is a form of change, so they  don’t want it. Another difference: they don’t honour living poets,  only dead ones. Why? Because dead poets don’t write anything new,  but live ones do. A third difference: their education system is insanely  harsh; ours is famously lax. Why? Because they don’t want their kids  to dare to question anything, so that they won’t ever think of  changing anything. How am I doing? socrates: You  are quick on the uptake as usual, Aristocles. How- ever – chaerephon:  Socrates, I think I know plenty of Athenians who do  248 the beginning of infinity not seek improvement! We have many politicians who think they’re  perfect. And many sophists who think they know everything. socrates:  But what, specifically, do those politicians believe to be  perfect? Their own grandiose plans for how to  improve  the city .  Similarly, each sophist believes that everyone should adopt his ideas,  which he sees as an  improvement  over everything that has been  believed before .  The laws and customs of Athens are set up to  accommodate all these many rival ideas of perfection (as well as more  modest proposals for improvement), to subject them to criticism, to  winnow out from them what may be the few tiny seeds of truth, and  to test out those that seem the most promising. Thus those

 particular copper atom at the tip of the nose of the statue  of Sir Winston Churchill that stands in Parliament Square in London.  Let me try to explain why that copper atom is there. It is because Churchill  served as prime minister in the House of Commons nearby; and because  his ideas and leadership contributed to the Allied victory in the Second  World War; and because it is customary to honour such people by putting  up statues of them; and because bronze, a traditional material for such  statues, contains copper, and so on. Thus we explain a low-level physical  observation – the presence of a copper atom at a particular location –  through extremely high-level theories about emergent phenomena such  as ideas, leadership, war and tradition.  There is no reason why there should exist, even in principle, any lower- level  explanation  of the presence of that copper atom than the one I have  just given. Presumably a reductive ‘theory of everything’ would in  principle make a low-level  prediction  of the probability that such a statue  will exist, given the condition of (say) the solar system at some earlier  date. It would also in principle describe how the statue probably got  there. But such descriptions and predictions (wildly infeasible, of course)  would explain nothing. They would merely describe the trajectory that  each copper atom followed from the copper mine, through the smelter  and the sculptor’s studio and so on . . . In fact such a prediction would  have to refer to atoms all over the planet, engaged in the complex motion  we call the Second World War, among other things. But even if you had  the superhuman capacity to follow such lengthy predictions of the copper  atom’s being there, you would still not be able to say ‘Ah yes, now I  understand  why  they are there’. [You] would have to inquire into  what  it was  about that configuration of atoms, and those trajectories, that gave  110 the beginning of infinity them the propensity to deposit a copper atom at this location. Pursuing  that inquiry would be a creative task, as discovering new explanations  always is. You would have to discover that certain atomic configurations  support emergent phenomena such as leadership and war, which are  related to one another by high-level explanatory theories. Only when  you knew those theories could you understand why that copper atom is  where it is. Even in physics, some of the most fundamental explanations, and  the predictions that they make, are not reductive. For instance, the  second law of thermodynamics says that high-level physical processes  tend towards ever greater disorder. A scrambled egg never becomes  un      scrambled by the whisk, and never extracts energy from the pan to  propel itself upwards into the shell, which never seamlessly reseals  itself. Yet, if you could somehow make a video of the scrambling  process with enough resolution to see the individual molecules, and  play it backwards, and examine any part of it at that scale, you would  see nothing but molecules moving and colliding in strict obedience to  the low-level laws of physics. It is not yet known how, or whether, the  second law of thermodynamics can be derived from a simple statement  about individual atoms. There is no reason why it should be. There is often a moral overtone  to reductionism (science  should be  essentially reductive). This is related  both to instrumentalism and to the Principle of Mediocrity, which I  criticized in Chapters 1 and 3. Instrumentalism is rather like reductionism  except that, instead of rejecting only high-level explanations, it tries to  reject all explanations. The Principle of Mediocrity is a milder form of  reductionism: it rejects only high-level explanations that involve people.  While I am on the subject of bad philosophical doctrines with moral  overtones, let me add  holism , a sort of mirror image of reductionism.  It is the idea that the only valid explanations (or at least the only  significant ones) are of parts in terms of wholes. Holists also often share  with reductionists the mistaken belief that science  can only  (or should  only) be reductive, and therefore they oppose much of science. All those  doctrines are irrational for the same reason: they advocate accepting  or rejecting theories on grounds other than whether they are good  explanations. Whenever a high-level explanation does follow logically from  111 The Reality of Abstractions low-level ones, that also means that the high-level one  implies something  about the low-level ones. Thus, additional high-level theories, provided  that they were all consistent, would place more and more constraints  on what the low-level theories could be. So it could be that all the  high-level explanations that exist, taken together,  imply  all the low-level  ones, as well as vice versa. Or it could be that some low-level, some  intermediate-level and some high-level explanations, taken together,  imply  all

Yet we have a great deal of knowledge  about the vast and unfamiliar reality that causes them, and of the  elegant, universal laws that govern that reality. This knowledge consists  of explanations: assertions about what is out there beyond the appear- ances, and how it behaves. For most of the history of our species, we  had almost no success in creating such knowledge. Where does it come  from? Empiricism said that we derive it from sensory experience. This  is false. The real source of our theories is conjecture, and the real source  of our knowledge is conjecture alternating with criticism. We create  theories by rearranging, combining, altering and adding to existing  ideas with the intention of improving upon them. The role of experiment  and observation is to choose between existing theories, not to be the  source of new ones. We interpret experiences through explanatory  theories, but true explanations are not obvious. Fallibilism entails not  looking to authorities but instead acknowledging that we may always  be mistaken, and trying to correct errors. We do so by seeking good  explanations – explanations that are hard to vary in the sense that  changing the details would ruin the explanation. This, not experimental  testing, was the decisive factor in the scientific revolution, and also    in the unique, rapid, sustained progress in other fields that have partici- pated in the Enlightenment. That was a rebellion against authority  which, unlike most such rebellions, tried not to seek authoritative  33 The Reach of Explanations justifications for theories, but instead set up a tradition of criticism.  Some of the resulting ideas have enormous reach: they explain more  than what they were originally designed to. The reach of an explanation  is an intrinsic attribute of it, not an assumption that we make about it  as empiricism and inductivism claim. Now I’ll say some more about appearance and reality, explanation  and infinity. 34 2 Closer to Reality A galaxy is a mind-bogglingly huge thing.

 you my best  guess first. So I thought: yes, we already knew he’s the wisest. And  that he’s modest. But we didn’t know quite  how  modest. So that’s  what the god revealed to us! That Socrates is so modest that he’d  contradict even a god saying he’s wise. companions: [ Laugh. ] plato : And another thing:  we  knew of Socrates’ excellence, but now  Apollo has revealed it to  the whole world . 244 the beginning of infinity chaerephon: [ under his breath ] Then I wish ‘the whole world’ had  chipped in for the fee. plato : What was that? Did I get it right? [socrates  draws breath to answer, but  plato  again continues .] Oh, and Socrates, may I call you ‘Master’? socrates: No.  plato : Yes, yes, of course. Sorry. It’s just that I’ve been hanging out  with some Spartan kids at the gymnasium, and they talk like that  all the time. ‘My master says this. My master says that. My master  does not permit . . . ’ and so on and so on. It got so that I became a  bit envious that I don’t have a master myself, so – companion no. 1: Eww,  Plato! plato : Yeah, but –  chaerephon: [ catching up ]  Spartan  kids? Aristocles, that is most  improper. We are at war! plato : Not here in Delphi we’re not. They’d  never  violate the sacred  truce of the Oracle. They’re very devout, you know. Nice kids, despite  their funny accents. We spoke a lot about wrestling – in between  actual wrestling, that is. We were up all night, wrestling by candle- light. I’ve never done that before. They’re really good! Though they  do sometimes cheat as well. [ Smiles indulgently in recollection .] But,  even so, I wasn’t going to let our city be humiliated. I won a few  bouts for Athens, you’ll be glad to know. That was intense! They  taught me some great moves. I can’t wait to try them out back home.  For some reason none of them are much into poetry, though. socrates:  They don’t honour poets in Sparta. Not living ones,  anyway.  plato : Oh! Pity. I dashed off a poem in commemoration of our  wrestling competition. Or rather, between the lines, it’s really about  why Athens is better than Sparta. It’s a mathematical argument . . .  Anyway, I’ve just sent a slave over to their compound to recite it to  them, but if they don’t honour poets perhaps they won’t appreciate  it. Oh well. It goes like this – chaerephon:  Aristocles – last night Socrates was visited by the god  Hermes! plato : Wow! Why didn’t you call us, Socrates? That would have  trumped even wrestling with Spartans!  245 A Dream of Socrates socrates: I  couldn’t call anyone because it happened in a dream – or  something. I’m not even sure that it was really the god. But, as he  pointed out to me, it doesn’t matter. plato : Why not? Oh, I guess that, once the experience is over, all that  matters is what you learned from it. So, what did he want? I bet he  wanted to poach you away from the cult of Apollo. Don’t do it,  Socrates! Apollo is much better. Not that there’s anything  wrong  with Hermes, but he has no Oracle. And he’s not as cool – chaerephon: [ shocked ] Show some respect, Aristocles – to Socrates  and  to the gods! socrates: He  is  showing respect, Chaerephon, in his own way.  plato : [ mystified ] Of course I respect them, Chaerephon. And you  know I’d literally worship Socrates if he’d let me. Oh, and I respect  you too, old man. Greatly. I beg you to forgive me if I have offended  you: I know I get too enthusiastic sometimes. [ Pauses briefly .] But,  Socrates – what did you ask the god and what did he reply? socrates: It  wasn’t quite like that. He came to reveal to me a new  branch of philosophy:  epistemology  – knowledge about knowledge,  which also has implications for morality and other fields. Much of  it I already knew, or partially knew in various special cases. But he  gave me a god’s-eye overview, which was breathtaking. Interestingly,  he mainly did this by asking  me  questions, and inviting  me  to think  about certain things. It seems an effective technique – I may try it  sometime. plato : Tell us everything, Socrates! Start with the most interesting  thing he asked, and your reply. socrates: W ell – one thing he asked me to do was to imagine a  ‘Spartan Socrates’.  plato : A Spartan  what ? Oh! I see!  That  must be whom the Oracle  meant. How sneaky Apollo is! It’s the  Spartan  Socrates who’s the  wisest man in the world – though only by the breadth of a hair, I’ll  bet! But, being Spartan, he’s probably the greatest warrior as well.  Awesome! Of course I know you were a great warrior in your day  too, Socrates. But still – a  Spartan  Socrates! So are we going to Sparta  to see him right away? Please! chaerephon:   Aristocles –  the war! socrates:      Sorry to disappoint you, Aristocles, but it was a  246 the beginning of infinity purely intellectual exercise. There is no ‘Spartan Socrates’. In fact I  know of no Spartan philosophers at all. In a way, that is what much  of my conversation with Hermes was about. plato : Please tell us more. [ While

 in the first place. (The theory that the  designer of the biosphere was designed by another designer, and so on  ad infinitum, is another example of an infinite regress.) One day in Infinity Hotel, a guest’s pet puppy happens to climb into  a trash bag. The owner does not notice, and passes the bag, with the  puppy, to the next room.  Within two minutes the puppy is nowhere. The distraught owner  phones the front desk. The receptionist announces over the public- address system, ‘We apologize for the inconvenience, but an item    of value has been inadvertently  thrown away. Will all guests please  undo all the trash-moving actions  that they have just performed, in  reverse order, starting as soon as  you receive a trash bag from the  next-higher-numbered room.’ But to no avail. None of the  guests return any bags, because  their fellow guests in the higher- numbered rooms are not returning  any either. It was no exaggeration to say that the bags are nowhere.  They have not been stuffed into a mythical ‘room number infinity’.  They no longer exist; nor does the puppy. No one has done anything  to the puppy except move it to another numbered room, within the  hotel. Yet it is not in any room. It is not anywhere in the hotel, or  anywhere else. In a finite hotel, if you move an object from room to  room, in however complicated a pattern, it will end up in one of those  rooms. Not so with an infinite number of rooms. Every individual  action that the guests performed was both harmless to the puppy and  175 A Window on Infinity perfectly reversible. Yet, taken together, those actions annihilated the  puppy and cannot be reversed. Reversing them cannot work, because, if it did, there would be no  explanation for why a puppy arrived at its owner’s room and not a  kitten. If a puppy did arrive, the explanation would have to be that a  puppy was passed down from the next-higher-numbered room – and  so on. But that whole infinite sequence of explanations never gets round  to explaining ‘why a puppy?’ It is an infinite regress. What if, one day, a puppy did just arrive at room 1, having been  passed down through all the rooms? That is not  logically  impossible:  it would merely lack an explanation. In physics, the ‘nowhere’ from  which such a puppy would have come is called a ‘naked singularity’.  Naked singularities appear in some speculative theories in physics, but  such theories are rightly criticized on the grounds that they cannot  make predictions. As Hawking once put it, ‘Television sets could come  out [of a naked singularity].’ It would be different if there were a law  of nature determining what comes out – for in that case there would  be no infinite regress and the singularity would not be ‘naked’. The Big  Bang may have been a singularity of that relatively benign type. I said that the rooms are identical, but they do differ in one respect:  their room numbers. So, given the types of tasks that the management  request from time to time, the low-numbered rooms are the most  desirable. For instance, the guest in room 1 has the unique privilege of  never having to deal with anyone else’s trash. Moving to room 1 feels  like winning first prize in a lottery. Moving to room 2 feels only slightly  less so. But  every  guest has a room number that is unusually close to  the beginning. So every guest in the hotel is more privileged than almost  all other guests. The clichéd politician’s promise to favour  everyone   can be honoured in Infinity Hotel.  Every room is at the beginning of infinity. That is one of the attributes  of the unbounded growth of knowledge too: we are only just scratching  the surface, and shall never be doing anything else.  So there is no such thing as a  typical   room number  at Infinity Hotel.  Every room number is untypically close to the beginning. The intuitive  idea that there must be ‘typical’ or ‘average’ members of any set of  values is false for infinite sets. The same is true of the intuitive ideas of  ‘rare’ and ‘common’. We might think that half of all natural numbers  176 the beginning of infinity are odd, and half even – so that odd and even numbers are equally  common among the natural numbers. But consider the following  rearrangement: A rearrangement of the natural numbers that makes it look as though one-third  of them are odd That makes it look as though the odd numbers are only half as common  as even ones. Similarly, we could make it look as though the odd  numbers were one in a million or any other proportion. So the intuitive  notion of a  proportion  of the members of a set does not necessarily  apply to infinite sets either. After the shocking loss of the puppy, the management of Infinity  Hotel want to restore the morale of the guests, so they arrange a  surprise. They announce that every guest will receive a complimentary  copy of either  The Beginning of Infinity  or my previous book,  The  Fabric of Reality.  They distribute them as follows: they dispatch a

 celebrates Persephone’s revenge and the  anniversary of her escape by commanding plants to grow and adorn  the Earth. This myth accounts for the same observations as the original,  and it is testable (and in fact refuted) by the same observations. Yet  what it asserts about reality is markedly different from – in many ways  it is the opposite of – the original myth. Every other detail of the story, apart from its bare prediction that  winter happens once a year, is just as easily variable. So, although the  myth was created to explain the seasons, it is only superficially adapted  to that purpose. When its author was wondering what could possibly  make a goddess do something once a year, he did not shout, ‘Eureka!  It must have been a marriage contract enforced by a magic seed.’ He  made that choice – and all his substantive choices as author – for  cultural and artistic reasons, and not because of the attributes of winter  at all. He may also have been trying to explain aspects of human nature  metaphorically – but here I am concerned with the myth only in its  capacity as an explanation  of seasons , and in that respect even its  21 The Reach of Explanations author could not have denied that the role of all the details could be  played equally well by countless other things. The Persephone and Freyr myths assert radically incompatible things  about what is happening in reality to cause seasons. Yet no one, I guess,  has ever adopted either myth as a result of comparing it on its merits  with the other, because there is no way of distinguishing between them.  If we ignore all the parts of both myths whose role could be easily  replaced, we are left with the same core explanation in both cases:  the  gods did it . Although Freyr is a very different god of spring from  Persephone, and his battles very different events from her conjugal  visits, none of those differing attributes has any function in the myths’  respective accounts of why seasons happen. Hence none of them  provides any reason for choosing one explanation over the other. The reason those myths are so easily variable is that their details are  barely connected to the details of the phenomena. Nothing in the  problem of why winter happens is addressed by postulating specifically  a marriage contract or a magic seed, or the gods Persephone, Hades  and Demeter – or Freyr. Whenever a wide range of variant theories can  account equally well for the phenomenon they are trying to explain,  there is no reason to prefer one of them over the others, so advocating  a particular one in preference to the others is irrational.  That freedom to make drastic changes in those mythical explanations  of seasons is the fundamental flaw in them. It is the reason that myth- making in general is not an effective way to understand the world. And  that is so whether the myths are testable or not, for whenever it is easy  to vary an explanation without changing its predictions, one could just  as easily vary it to make different predictions if they were needed. For  example, if the ancient Greeks  had  discovered that the seasons in the  northern and southern hemispheres are out of phase, they would have  had a choice of countless slight variants of the myth that would be  consistent with that observation. One would be that when Demeter is  sad she banishes warmth  from her vicinity , and it has to go elsewhere  – into the southern hemisphere. Similarly, slight variants of the Perse- phone explanation could account just as well for seasons that were  marked by green rainbows, or seasons that happened once a week, or  sporadically, or not at all. Likewise for the superstitious gambler or  the end-of-the-world prophet: when their theory is refuted by experience,  22 the beginning of infinity they do indeed switch to a new one; but, because their underlying  explanations are bad, they can easily accommodate the new experience  without changing the substance of the explanation. Without a good  explanatory theory, they can simply reinterpret the omens, pick a new  date, and make essentially the same prediction. In such cases, testing  one’s theory and abandoning it when it is refuted constitutes no  progress towards understanding the world. If an explanation could  easily explain anything in the given field, then it actually explains  nothing. In general, when theories are easily variable in the sense I have  described, experimental testing is almost useless for correcting their  errors. I call such theories  bad explanations.  Being proved wrong by  experiment, and changing the theories to other bad explanations, does  not get their holders one jot closer to the truth.  Because explanation plays this central role in science, and because  testability is of little use in the case of bad explanations, I myself prefer  to call myths, superstitions and similar theories  un scientific even when  they make testable predictions. But it does not matter what terminology  you use, so

 entrenched racial divisions, or various traditions of political violence.  Hence I do not intend the above discussion of electoral systems to  constitute a blanket endorsement of plurality voting as the One True  System of democracy, suitable for all polities under all circumstances.  Even democracy itself is unworkable under some circumstances. But  in the advanced political cultures of the Enlightenment tradition the  creation of knowledge can and should be paramount, and the idea that  representative government depends on proportionate representation  in the legislature is unequivocally a mistake. In the United States’ system of government, the Senate is required  to be representative in a different sense from the House of Represen- tatives:  states  are represented equally, in recognition of the fact that  each state is a separate political entity with its own distinctive political  and legal tradition. Each of them is entitled to two Senate seats,  regardless of population. Because the states differ greatly in their  populations (currently the most populous state, California, has    nearly seventy times the population of the least populous, Wyoming),  the Senate’s apportionment rule creates enormous deviations from  population-based proportionality – much larger than those that are  so hotly disputed in regard to the House of Representatives. And yet  350 the beginning of infinity historically, after elections, it is rare for the Senate and the House of  Representatives to be controlled by different parties. This suggests that  there is more going on in this vast process of apportionments and  elections than merely ‘representation’ – the mirroring of the population  by the legislature. Could it be that the problem-solving that is promoted  by the plurality voting system is continually changing the  options  of  the voters, and also their  preferences  among the options, through  persuasion? And so opinions  and preferences are, despite appear  ances,  converging  – not in the sense of there being less disagreement (since  solutions create new problems), but in the sense of creating ever more  shared knowledge. In science, we do not consider it surprising that a community of  scientists with different initial hopes and expectations, continually in  dispute about their rival theories, gradually come into near-unanimous  agreement over a steady stream of issues (yet still continue to disagree  all the time). It is not surprising because, in their case, there are  observable facts that they can use to test their theories. They converge  with each other on any given issue because they are all converging on  the objective truth. In politics it is customary to be cynical about that  sort of convergence being possible.  But that is a pessimistic view. Throughout the West, a great deal of  philosophical knowledge that is nowadays taken for granted by almost  everyone – say, that slavery is an abomination, or that women should  be free to go out to work, or that autopsies should be legal, or that  promotion in the armed forces should not depend on skin colour – was  highly controversial only a matter of decades ago, and originally the  opposite positions were taken for granted. A successful truth-seeking  system works its way towards broad consensus or near-unanimity – the  one state of public opinion that is not subject to decision-theoretic  paradoxes and where ‘the will of the people’ makes sense. So conver- gence in the broad consensus over time is made possible by the fact  that all concerned are gradually eliminating errors in their positions  and converging on objective truths. Facilitating that process – by  meeting Popper’s criterion as well as possible – is more important than  which of two contending factions with near-equal support gets its way  at a particular election. In regard to the apportionment issue too, since the United States’  351 Choices Constitution was instituted there have been enormous changes in    the prevailing conception of what it means for a government to be  ‘representative’. Recognizing the right of women to vote, for instance,  doubled the number of voters – and implicitly admitted that in every  previous election half the population had been disenfranchised, and  the other half over-represented compared with a just representation.  In numerical terms, such injustices dwarf all the injustices of apportion- ment that have absorbed so much political energy over the centuries.  But it is to the credit of the political system, and of the people of the  United States and of the West in general, that, while they were fiercely  debating the fairness of shifting a few percentage points’ worth of  representation between one state and another, they were also debating,  and making, these momentous improvements. And they too became  uncontroversial. Apportionment systems, electoral systems and other institutions of  human cooperation were for the most part designed, or evolved, to  cope
