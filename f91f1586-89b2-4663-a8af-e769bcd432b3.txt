======================================================== and said, “I’ll prepare a freshman lecture on it.” But a few days later he re- turned and said, “You know, I couldn’t do it. I couldn’t reduce it to the freshman level. That means we really don’t understand it.” This specialty of reducing deep ideas to simple, understandable terms is evident throughout  The Feynman Lectures on Physics,  but nowhere more so than in his treatment of quantum mechanics. To aﬁcionados, what he has done is clear. He has presented, to begin- ning students, the path integral method, the technique of his own devising that allowed him to solve some of the most profound prob- lems in physics. His own work using path integrals, among other achievements, led to the 1965 Nobel Prize that he shared with Ju- lian Schwinger and Sin-Itero Tomanaga. Through the distant veil of memory, many of the students and faculty attending the lectures have said that having two years of physics with Feynman was the experience of a lifetime. But that’s not how it seemed at the time. Many of the students dreaded the class, and as the course wore on, attendance by the registered stu- dents started dropping alarmingly. But at the same time, more and xxii Special Preface 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:00 PM  Page xxii more faculty and graduate students started attending. The room stayed full, and Feynman may never have known he was losing some of his intended audience. But even in Feynman’s view, his pedagogical endeavor did not succeed. He wrote in the 1963 pref- ace to the  Lectures:  “I don’t think I did very well by the students.” Rereading the books, one sometimes seems to catch Feynman look- ing over his shoulder, not at his young audience, but directly at his colleagues, saying, “Look at that! Look how I ﬁnessed that point! Wasn’t that clever?” But even when he thought he was explaining things lucidly to freshmen or sophomores, it was not really they who were able to beneﬁt most from what he was doing. It was his peers—scientists, physicists, and professors—who would be the main beneﬁciaries of his magniﬁcent achievement, which was noth- ing less than to see physics through the fresh and dynamic perspec- tive of Richard Feynman. Feynman was more than a great teacher. His gift was that he was an extraordinary teacher of teachers. If the purpose in giving  The Feynman Lectures on Physics  was to prepare a roomful of undergrad- uate students to solve examination problems in physics, he cannot be said to have succeeded particularly well. Moreover, if the intent was for the books to serve as introductory college textbooks, he cannot be said to have achieved his goal. Nevertheless, the books have been translated into ten foreign languages and are available in four bilingual editions. Feynman himself believed that his most im- portant contribution to physics would not be QED, or the theory of superﬂuid helium, or polarons, or partons. His foremost contri- bution would be the three red books of  The Feynman Lectures on Physics.  That belief fully justiﬁes this commemorative issue of these celebrated books. David L.

The lec- tures are, of course, not verbatim—they have been edited, some- times extensively and sometimes less so. The lectures form only part of the complete course. The whole group of 180 students gathered in a big lecture room twice a week to hear these lectures and then they broke up into small groups of 15 to 20 students in recitation sections under the guidance of a teaching assistant. In addition, there was a laboratory session once a week. The special problem we tried to get at with these lectures was to maintain the interest of the very enthusiastic and rather smart stu- dents coming out of the high schools and into Caltech. They have heard a lot about how interesting and exciting physics is—the theory of relativity, quantum mechanics, and other modern ideas. By the end of two years of our previous course, many would be very discouraged because there were really very few grand, new, modern ideas presented to them. They were made to study inclined planes, electrostatics, and so forth, and after two years it was quite stultifying. The problem was whether or not we could make a course which would save the more advanced and excited student by maintaining his enthusiasm. The lectures here are not in any way meant to be a survey course, but are very serious. I thought to address them to the most intelli- gent in the class and to make sure, if possible, that even the most xxv 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:00 PM  Page xxv intelligent student was unable to completely encompass everything that======================================================== 5.5 x 8.25”  B: 7/16” BASIC PB BLACK  +PMS 108 +PMS 1655 +PMS 234 FINISH: Gritty Matte six  easy pieces “The most original mind of his generation.”   —Freeman Dyson 6 Richa R d   p .

From 1961 to 1963,  Feynman delivered a series of lectures at the California Institute of Technology that  revolutionized the teaching of physics around the world.  Six Easy Pieces , taken from these  famous  Lectures on Physics , represent the most accessible material from the series.  In  these  classic  lessons,  Feynman  introduces  the  general  reader  to  the  following  topics: atoms, basic physics, energy, gravitation, quantum mechanics, and the relationship  of physics to other topics. With his dazzling and inimitable wit, Feynman presents each  discussion with a minimum of jargon. Filled with wonderful examples and clever illustrations,  Six Easy Pieces  is the ideal introduction to the fundamentals of physics by one of the most  admired and accessible physicists of modern times. “The essence of physics and Feynman. No jargon, just ideas, excitement, and the  straight dope. And real answers, like ‘we don’t know.’ ”                 — s T e phen Wol F r am The late  Richa R d  P.

In quantum electrodynamics,  two numbers  are put in and most of the other numbers in the world are supposed to come out. The two numbers that are put in are called the mass of the electron and the charge of the electron. Ac- tually, that is not quite true, for we have a whole set of numbers for chemistry which tells how heavy the nuclei are. That leads us to the next part. Nuclei and particles What are the nuclei made of, and how are they held together? It is found that the nuclei are held together by enormous forces. When these are released, the energy released is tremendous compared with chemical energy, in the same ratio as the atomic bomb explosion is to a TNT explosion, because, of course, the atomic bomb has to do with changes inside the nucleus, while the explosion of TNT has to do with the changes of the electrons on the outside of the atoms. The question is, what are the forces which hold the protons and neutrons together in the nucleus? Just as the electrical interac- tion can be connected to a particle, a photon, Yukawa suggested that the forces between neutrons and protons also have a ﬁeld of some kind, and that when this ﬁeld jiggles it behaves like a particle. Thus there could be some other particles in the world besides pro- tons and neutrons, and he was able to deduce the properties of these particles from the already known characteristics of nuclear forces. For example, he predicted they should have a mass of two or three hundred times that of an electron; and lo and behold, in cosmic rays there was discovered a particle of the right mass! But it later turned out to be the wrong particle. It was called a  μ -meson, or muon. 38 Six Easy Pieces 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:01 PM  Page 38 However, a little while later, in 1947 or 1948, another particle was found, the  π -meson, or pion, which satisﬁed Yukawa’s criterion. Besides the proton and the neutron, then, in order to get nuclear forces we must add the pion. Now, you say, “Oh great!, with this theory we make quantum nucleodynamics using the pions just like Yukawa wanted to do, and see if it works, and everything will be explained.” Bad luck. It turns out that the calculations that are in- volved in this theory are so difficult that no one has ever been able to ﬁgure out what the consequences of the theory are, or to check it against experiment, and this has been going on now for almost twenty years! So we are stuck with a theory, and we do not know whether it is right or wrong, but we do know that it is a  little  wrong, or at least incomplete. While we have been dawdling around theoretically, trying to calculate the consequences of this theory, the experimen- talists have been discovering some things. For example, they had already discovered this  m -meson or muon, and we do not yet know where it ﬁts. Also, in cosmic rays, a large number of other “extra” particles were found. It turns out that today we have approximately thirty particles, and it is very difficult to understand the relation- ships of all these particles, and what nature wants them for, or what the connections are from one to another. We do not today under- stand these various particles as different aspects of the same thing, and the fact that we have so many unconnected particles is a rep- resentation of the fact that we have so much unconnected infor- mation without a good theory. After the great successes of quantum electrodynamics, there is a certain amount of knowledge of nuclear physics which is rough knowledge, sort of half experience and half theory, assuming a type of force between protons and neutrons and seeing what will happen, but not really understanding where the force comes from. Aside from that, we have made very little progress. We have collected an enormous number of chemical ele- ments. In the chemical case, there suddenly appeared a relationship among these elements which was unexpected, and which is embod- ied in the periodic table of Mendeléev. For example, sodium and 39 Basic Physics 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:01 PM  Page 39 potassium are about the same in their chemical properties and are found in the same column in the Mendeléev chart. We have been seeking a Mendeléev-type chart for the new particles. One such chart of the new particles was made independently by Gell-Mann in the USA and Nishijima in Japan. The basis of their classiﬁcation is a new number, like the electric charge, which can be assigned to each particle, called its “strangeness,”  S.  This number is conserved, like the electric charge, in reactions which take place by nuclear forces. In Table 2-2 are listed all the particles. We cannot discuss them much at this stage, but the table will at least show you how much we do not know. Underneath each particle its mass is given in a cer- tain unit, called the Mev. One Mev is equal to 1.782  ¥ 10 –27 gram.======================================================== down in 12 hours. Another school of thought claimed that the high tide should be on the other side of the earth because, so they ar- gued, the moon pulls the earth away from the water! Both of these theories are wrong. It actually works like this: The pull of the moon for the earth and for the water is “balanced” at the center. But the water which is closer to the moon is pulled  more  than the average and the water which is farther away from it is pulled  less  than the average. Furthermore, the water can ﬂow while the more rigid earth cannot. The true picture is a combination of these two things. What do we mean by “balanced”? What balances? If the moon pulls the whole earth toward it, why doesn’t the earth fall right “up” to the moon? Because the earth does the same trick as the moon: it goes in a circle around a point which is inside the earth but not at its center. The moon does not just go around the earth, the earth and the moon both go around a central position, each falling to- ward this common position, as shown in Fig. 5-5. This motion around the common center is what balances the fall of each. So the earth is not going in a straight line either; it travels in a circle. The water on the far side is “unbalanced” because the moon’s attraction there is weaker than it is at the center of the earth, where it just balances the “centrifugal force.” The result of this imbalance is that the water rises up, away from the center of the earth. On the near side, the attraction from the moon is stronger, and the imbalance is in the opposite direction in space, but again  away  from the center of the earth. The net result is that we get  two  tidal bulges. Universal gravitation What else can we understand when we understand gravity? Everyone knows the earth is round. Why is the earth round? That is easy; it is due to gravitation. The earth can be understood to be round merely because everything attracts everything else and so it has attracted it- 98 Six Easy Pieces 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:01 PM  Page 98 self together as far as it can! If we go even further, the earth is not exactly  a sphere because it is rotating, and this brings in centrifugal effects which tend to oppose gravity near the equator. It turns out that the earth should be elliptical, and we even get the right shape for the ellipse. We can thus deduce that the sun, the moon, and the earth should be (nearly) spheres, just from the law of gravitation. What else can you do with the law of gravitation? If we look at the moons of Jupiter we can understand everything about the way they move around that planet. Incidentally, there was once a certain difficulty with the moons of Jupiter that is worth remarking on. These satellites were studied very carefully by Roemer, who noticed that the moons sometimes seemed to be ahead of schedule, and sometimes behind. (One can ﬁnd their schedules by waiting a very long time and ﬁnding out how long it takes on the average for the moons to go around.) Now they were  ahead  when Jupiter was par- ticularly  close  to the earth and they were  behind  when Jupiter was farther  from the earth. This would have been a very difficult thing to explain according to the law of gravitation—it would have been, in fact, the death of this wonderful theory if there were no other ex- planation. If a law does not work even in  one place  where it ought to, it is just wrong. But the reason for this discrepancy was very simple and beautiful: it takes a little while to  see  the moons of Jupiter because of the time it takes light to travel from Jupiter to the earth. 99 The Theory of Gravitation Figure 5-5 The earth-moon system, with tides. 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:01 PM  Page 99 When Jupiter is closer to the earth the time is a little less, and when it is farther from the earth, the time is more. This is why moons ap- pear to be, on the average, a little ahead or a little behind, depending on whether they are closer to or farther from the earth. This phe- nomenon showed that light does not travel instantaneously, and fur- nished the ﬁrst estimate of the speed of light. This was done in 1656. If all of the planets push and pull on each other, the force which controls, let us say, Jupiter in going around the sun is not just the force from the sun; there is also a pull from, say, Saturn. This force is not really strong, since the sun is much more massive than Saturn, but there is  some  pull, so the orbit of Jupiter should not be a perfect ellipse, and it is not; it is slightly off, and “wobbles” around the cor- rect elliptical orbit. Such a motion is a little more complicated. At- tempts were made to analyze the motions of Jupiter, Saturn, and Uranus on the basis of the law of gravitation. The effects of each of these planets on each other were calculated to see whether or not the tiny deviations and irregularities in these motions could be com- pletely understood from this one law. Lo and behold, for Jupiter======================================================== one to suffer fools gladly, he broke the rules whenever he found them arbitrary or absurd. His autobiographical writings contain amusing stories of Feynman outwitting the atom-bomb security services during the war, Feynman cracking safes, Feynman disarming women with outrageously bold behavior. He treated his Nobel Prize, awarded for his work on QED, in a similar take-it-or-leave- it manner. Alongside this distaste for formality, Feynman had a fascination with the quirky and obscure. Many will remember his obsession with the long-lost country of Tuva in Central Asia, captured so de- lightfully in a documentary ﬁlm made near the time of his death. xii Introduction 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:00 PM  Page xii His other passions included playing the bongo drums, painting, frequenting strip clubs, and deciphering Mayan texts. Feynman himself did much to cultivate his distinctive persona. Although reluctant to put pen to paper, he was voluble in conver- sation, and loved to tell stories about his ideas and escapades. These anecdotes, accumulated over the years, helped add to his mystique and made him a proverbial legend in his own lifetime. His engaging manner endeared him greatly to students, especially the younger ones, many of whom idolized him. When Feynman died of cancer in 1988 the students at Caltech, where he had worked for most of his career, unfurled a banner with the simple message: “We love you Dick.” It was Feynman’s happy-go-lucky approach to life in general and physics in particular that made him such a superb communicator. He had little time for formal lecturing or even for supervising Ph.D. students. Nevertheless he could give brilliant lectures when it suited him, deploying all the sparkling wit, penetrating insight, and irreverence that he brought to bear on his research work. In the early 1960s Feynman was persuaded to teach an introduc- tory physics course to Caltech freshmen and sophomores. He did so with characteristic panache and his inimitable blend of informality, zest, and offbeat humor. Fortunately, these priceless lectures were saved for posterity in book form. Though far removed in style and presentation from more conventional teaching texts,  The Feynman Lectures on Physics  were a huge success, and they excited and inspired a generation of students across the world. Three decades on, these vol- umes have lost nothing of their sparkle and lucidity.  Six Easy Pieces is culled directly from  The Feynman Lectur es on Physics.  It is intended to give general readers a substantive taste of Feynman the Educator by drawing on the early, nontechnical chapters from that landmark work. The result is a delightful volume—it serves both as a primer on physics for nonscientists and as a primer on Feynman himself. What is most impressive about Feynman’s carefully crafted ex- position is the way that he can develop far-reaching physical no- tions from the most slender investment in concepts, and a xiii Introduction 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:00 PM  Page xiii minimum in the way of mathematics and technical jargon. He has the knack of ﬁnding just the right analogy or everyday illustration to bring out the essence of a deep principle, without obscuring it in incidental or irrelevant details. The selection of topics contained in this volume is not intended as a comprehensive survey of modern physics, but as a tantalizing taste of the Feynman approach. We soon discover how he can illuminate even mundane topics like force and motion with new insights. Key concepts are illustrated by examples drawn from daily life or antiq- uity. Physics is continually linked to other sciences while leaving the reader in no doubt about which is the fundamental discipline. Right at the beginning of  Six Easy Pieces  we learn how all physics is rooted in the notion of law—the existence of an ordered universe that can be understood by the application of rational reasoning. However, the laws of physics are not transparent to us in our direct observations of nature. They are frustratingly hidden, subtly en- coded in the phenomena we study. The arcane procedures of the physicist—a mixture of carefully designed experimentation and mathematical theorizing—are needed to unveil the underlying law- like reality. Possibly the best-known law of physics is Newton’s inverse square law of gravitation, discussed here in Chapter Five. The topic is introduced in the context of the solar system and Kepler’s laws of planetary motion. But gravitation is universal, applying across the cosmos, enabling Feynman to spice his account with examples from astronomy and cosmology. Commenting on a picture of a globular cluster somehow held together by unseen forces, he waxes lyrical: “If one cannot see gravitation acting here, he has no soul.” Other laws are known that refer to the various nongravitational forces of nature that describe how particles of matter interact with each other. There is but a handful of these forces, and======================================================== remarkable process of detective work, ﬁnd the arrangements of the atoms. Figure 1-9 is a picture of the air in the neighborhood of a violet; again we ﬁnd nitrogen and oxygen in the air, and water vapor. (Why is there water vapor? Because the violet is  wet.  All plants transpire.) However, we also see a “monster” composed of carbon atoms, hydrogen atoms, and oxygen atoms, which have picked a certain particular pattern in which to be arranged. It is a much more complicated arrangement than that of carbon dioxide; 17 Atoms in Motion Figure 1-9 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:01 PM  Page 17 in fact, it is an enormously complicated arrangement. Unfortu- nately, we cannot picture all that is really known about it chemi- cally, because the precise arrangement of all the atoms is actually known in three dimensions, while our picture is in only two di- mensions. The six carbons which form a ring do not form a ﬂat ring, but a kind of “puckered” ring. All of the angles and distances are known. So a chemical  formula  is merely a picture of such a mol- ecule. When the chemist writes such a thing on the blackboard, he is trying to “draw,” roughly speaking, in two dimensions. For ex- ample, we see a “ring” of six carbons, and a “chain” of carbons hang- ing on the end, with an oxygen second from the end, three hydrogens tied to that carbon, two carbons and three hydrogens sticking up here, etc. How does the chemist ﬁnd what the arrangement is? He mixes bottles full of stuff together, and if it turns red, it tells him that it consists of one hydrogen and two carbons tied on here; if it turns blue, on the other hand, that is not the way it is at all. This is one of the most fantastic pieces of detective work that has ever been done—organic chemistry. To discover the arrangement of the atoms in these enormously complicated arrays the chemist looks at what happens when he mixes two different substances together. The physicist could never quite believe that the chemist knew what he was talking about when he described the arrangement of the atoms. For about twenty years it has been possible, in some cases, to look at such molecules (not quite as complicated as this one, but some which contain parts of it) by a physical method, and it has been possible to locate every atom, not by looking at colors, but by  mea- suring where they are.  And lo and behold!, the chemists are almost always correct. It turns out, in fact, that in the odor of violets there are three slightly different molecules, which differ only in the arrangement of the hydrogen atoms. One problem of chemistry is to name a substance, so that we will know what it is. Find a name for this shape! Not only must the name 18 Six Easy Pieces 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:01 PM  Page 18 tell the shape, but it must also tell that here is an oxygen atom, there a hydrogen—exactly what and where each atom is. So we can ap- preciate that the chemical names must be complex in order to be complete. You see that the name of this thing in the more complete form that will tell you the structure of it is 4-(2, 2, 3, 6 tetramethyl- 5-cyclohexenyl)-3-buten-2-one, and that tells you that this is the arrangement. We can appreciate the difficulties that the chemists have, and also appreciate the reason for such long names. It is not that they wish to be obscure, but they have an extremely difficult problem in trying to describe the molecules in words! How do we  know  that there are atoms? By one of the tricks men- tioned earlier: we make the  hypothesis  that there are atoms, and one after the other results come out the way we predict, as they ought to if things  are  made of atoms. There is also somewhat more direct evidence, a good example of which is the following: The atoms are so small that you cannot see them with a light microscope—in fact, not ev en with an  electron  microscope. (With a light microscope you can only see things which are much bigger.) Now if the atoms are always in motion, say in water, and we put a big ball of some- thing in the water, a ball much bigger than the atoms, the ball will jiggle around—much as in a push ball game, where a great big ball is pushed around by a lot of people. The people are pushing in var- ious directions, and the ball moves around the ﬁeld in an irregular fashion. So, in the same way, the  “large ball” will mo ve because of 19 Atoms in Motion Figure 1-10 The substance pictured is  ▶ -irone. 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:01 PM  Page 19 the inequalities of the collisions on one side to the other, from one moment to the next. Therefore, if we look at very tiny particles (colloids) in water through an excellent microscope, we see a per- petual jiggling of the particles, which is the result of the bombard- ment of the atoms. This is called the  Brownian motion. We can see further evidence for atoms in the structure of crystals. In many cases the structures deduced by x-ray analysis agree in their spatial “shapes”======================================================== 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:01 PM  Page 71 in little blobs of a deﬁnite amount. It is not that way. However, there are formulas for calculating some numerical quantity, and when we add it all together it gives “28”—always the same number. It is an abstract thing in that it does not tell us the mechanism or the  reasons  for the various formulas. Gravitational potential energy Conservation of energy can be understood only if we have the for- mula for all of its forms. I wish to discuss the formula for gravita- tional energy near the surface of the earth, and I wish to derive this formula in a way which has nothing to do with history but is simply a line of reasoning invented for this particular lecture to give you an illustration of the remarkable fact that a great deal about nature can be extracted from a few facts and close reasoning. It is an illus- tration of the kind of work theoretical physicists become involved in. It is patterned after a most excellent argument by Mr. Carnot on the efficiency of steam engines.* Consider weight-lifting machines—machines which have the property that they lift one weight by lowering another. Let us also make a hypothesis: that  there is no such thing as perpetual motion  with these weight-lifting machines. (In fact, that there is no perpetual mo- tion at all is a general statement of the law of conservation of energy.) We must be careful to deﬁne perpetual motion. First, let us do it for weight-lifting machines. If, when we have lifted and lowered a lot of weights and restored the machine to the original condition, we ﬁnd that the net result is to have  lifted a weight,  then we have a perpetual motion machine because we can use that lifted weight to run some- thing else. That is,  provided  the machine which lifted the weight is brought back to its exact  original condition,  and furthermore that it is completely  self-contained —that it has not received the energy to lift that weight from some external source—like Bruce’s blocks. A very simple weight-lifting machine is shown in Fig. 4-1. This 72 Six Easy Pieces * Our point here is not so much the result, (4.3), which in fact you may already know, as the possibility of arriving at it by theoretical reasoning. 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:01 PM  Page 72 machine lifts weights three units “strong.” We place three units on one balance pan, and one unit on the other. However, in order to get it actually to work, we must lift a little weight off the left pan. On the other hand, we could lift a one-unit weight by lowering the three-unit weight, if we cheat a little by lifting a little weight off the other pan. Of course, we realize that with any  actual  lifting ma- chine, we must add a little extra to get it to run. This we disregard, temporarily.  Ideal machines, although they do not exist, do not re- quire anything extra. A machine that we actually use can be, in a sense,  almost  reversible: that is, if it will lift the weight of three by lowering a weight of one, then it will also lift nearly the weight of one the same amount by lowering the weight of three. We imagine that there are two classes of machines, those that are not  reversible, which includes all real machines, and those that  are reversible, which of course are actually not attainable no matter how careful we may be in our design of bearings, levers, etc. We suppose, however, that there is such a thing—a re versible machine—which lowers one unit of weight (a pound or any other unit) by one unit of distance, and at the same time lifts a three-unit weight. Call this reversible machine Machine  A.  Suppose this particular reversible machine lifts the three-unit weight a distance  X.  Then suppose we have another machine, Machine  B,  which is not necessarily re- versible, which also lowers a unit weight a unit distance, but which lifts three units a distance  Y.  We can now prove that  Y  is not higher than  X;  that is, it is impossible to build a machine that will lift a weight  any higher  than it will be lifted by a reversible machine. Let us see why. Let us suppose that  Y  was higher than  X.  We take a one- unit weight and lower it one unit height with Machine  B,  and that lifts the three-unit weight up a distance  Y.  Then we could lower 73 Conservation of Energy Figure 4-1 Simple weight-lifting machine. 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:01 PM  Page 73 the weight from  Y  to  X ,  obtaining free power,  and use the reversible Machine  A,  running backwards, to lower the three-unit weight a distance  X  and lift the one-unit weight by one unit height. This will put the one-unit weight back where it was before, and leave both machines ready to be used again! We would therefore have perpetual motion if  Y were higher than  X,  which we assumed was impossible. With those assumptions, we thus deduce that  Y is not higher than X,  so that of all machines that can be designed, the re- versible machine is the best. We can also see======================================================== and Saturn, all was well, but Uranus was “weird.” It behaved in a very peculiar manner. It was not travelling in an exact ellipse, but that was understandable, because of the attractions of Jupiter and Saturn. But even if allowance were made for these attractions, Uranus  still was not going right, so the laws of gravitation were in danger of being overturned, a possibility that could not be ruled out. Two men, Adams and Le Verrier, in England and France, independently, arrived at another possibility: perhaps there is  another  planet, dark and invisible, which men had not seen. This planet,  N,  could pull on Uranus. They calculated where such a planet would have to be in order to cause the observed perturbations. They sent messages to the respective observatories, saying, “Gentlemen, point your tele- scope to such and such a place, and you will see a new planet.” It often depends on with whom you are working as to whether they pay any attention to you or not. They did pay attention to Le Ver- rier; they looked, and there planet  N  was! The other observatory then also looked very quickly in the next few days and saw it too. 100 Six Easy Pieces 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:01 PM  Page 100 This discovery shows that Newton’s laws are absolutely right in the solar system, but do they extend beyond the relatively small dis- tances of the nearest planets? The ﬁrst test lies in the question, do stars  attract  each other  as well as planets? We have deﬁnite evidence that they do in the  double stars.  Figure 5-6 shows a double star— two stars very close together (there is also a third star in the picture so that we will know that the photograph was not turned). The stars are also shown as they appeared several years later. We see that, relative to the “ﬁxed” star, the axis of the pair has rotated, i.e., the two stars are going around each other. Do they rotate according to Newton’s laws? Careful measurements of the relative positions of one such double star system are shown in Fig. 5-7. There we see a beautiful ellipse, the measures starting in 1862 and going all the way around to 1904 (by now it must have gone around once more). Everything coincides with Newton’s laws, except that the star Sirius A is  not at the focus.  Why should that be? Because the plane of the ellipse is not in the “plane of the sky.” We are not looking at right angles to the orbit plane, and when an ellipse is viewed at a tilt, it remains an ellipse but the focus is no longer at the same place. Thus we can analyze double stars, moving about each other, according to the requirements of the gravitational law. 101 The Theory of Gravitation Figure 5-6 A double-star system. 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:01 PM  Page 101 That the law of gravitation is true at even bigger distances is indi- cated in Fig. 5-8. If one cannot see gravitation acting here, he has no soul. This ﬁgure shows one of the most beautiful things in the sky— a globular star cluster. All of the dots are stars. Although they look as if they are packed solid toward the center, that is due to the fallibility of our instruments. Actually, the distances between even the center- most stars are very great and they very rarely collide. There are more stars in the interior than farther out, and as we move outward there are fewer and fewer. It is obvious that there is an attraction among these stars. It is clear that gravitation exists at these enormous dimen- sions, perhaps 100,000 times the size of the solar system. Let us now go further, and look at an  entire galaxy,  shown in Fig. 5-9. The shape of this galaxy indicates an obvious tendency for its matter to agglom- erate. Of course we cannot prove that the law here is precisely inverse square, only that there is still an attraction, at this enormous dimen- sion, that holds the whole thing together. One may say, “Well, that is all very clever but why is it not just a ball?” Because it is  spinning and has  angular momentum  which it cannot give up as it contracts; 102 Six Easy Pieces Figure 5-7 Orbit of Sirius B with respect to Sirius A. 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:01 PM  Page 102 it must co ntract mostly in a plane. (Incidentally, if you are looking for a good problem, the exact details of how the arms are formed and what determines the shapes of these galaxies have not been worked out.) It is, however, clear that the shape of the galaxy is due to gravi- tation even though the complexities of its structure have not yet al- lowed us to analyze it completely. In a galaxy we have a scale of perhaps 50,000 to 10 0,000 light-years. The earth’s distance from the sun is 8 1 / 3 light- minutes,  so you can see how large these dimensions are. Gravity appears to exist at even bigger dimensions, as indicated by Fig. 5-10, which shows many “little” things clustered together. This is a  cluster of galaxies,  just like a star cluster. Thus galaxies at- tract each other at such distances that they too are======================================================== with the forms actually exhibited by crystals as they occur in nature. The angles between the various “faces” of a crystal agree, within seconds of arc, with angles deduced on the assump- tion that a crystal is made of many “layers” of atoms. Everything is made of atoms.  That is the key hypothesis. The most important hypothesis in all of biology, for example, is that  every- thing that animals do, atoms do.  In other words,  there is nothing that living things do that cannot be understood from the point of view that they are made of atoms acting according to the laws of physics.  This was not known from the beginning: it took some experimenting and theorizing to suggest this hypothesis, but now it is accepted, and it is the most useful theory for producing new ideas in the ﬁeld of biology. If a piece of steel or a piece of salt, consisting of atoms one next to the other, can have such interesting properties; if water—which is nothing but these little blobs, mile upon mile of the same thing over the earth—can form waves and foam, and make rushing noises and strange patterns as it runs over cement; if all of this, all the life of a stream of water, can be nothing but a pile of atoms,  how much more is possible ? If instead of arranging the atoms in some deﬁnite pattern, again and again repeated, on and on, or even forming little lumps of complexity like the odor of violets, we make an arrange- ment which is  always different  from place to place, with different kinds of atoms arranged in many ways, continually changing, not repeating, how much more marvelously is it possible that this thing might behave? Is it possible that that “thing” walking back and forth in front of you, talking to you, is a great glob of these atoms 20 Six Easy Pieces 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:01 PM  Page 20 in a very complex arrangement, such that the sheer complexity of it staggers the imagination as to what it can do? When we say we are a pile of atoms, we do not mean we are  merely  a pile of atoms, because a pile of atoms which is not repeated from one to the other might well have the possibilities which you see before you in the mirror. 21 Atoms in Motion 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:01 PM  Page 21 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:01 PM  Page 22 BASIC PHYSICS Introduction In this chapter, we shall examine the most fundamental ideas that we have about physics—the nature of things as we see them at the present time. We shall not discuss the history of how we know that all these ideas are true; you will learn these details in due time. The things with which we concern ourselves in science appear in myriad forms, and with a multitude of attributes. For example, if we stand on the shore and look at the sea, we see the water, the waves breaking, the foam, the sloshing motion of the water, the sound, the air, the winds and the clouds, the sun and the blue sky, and light; there is sand and there are rocks of various hardness and permanence, color and texture. There are animals and seaweed, hunger and disease, and the observer on the beach; there may be even happiness and thought. Any other spot in nature has a similar variety of things and inﬂuences. It is always as complicated as that, no matter where it is. Curiosity demands that we ask questions, that we try to put things together and try to understand this mul- titude of aspects as perhaps resulting from the action of a relatively small number of elemental things and forces acting in an inﬁnite variety of combinations. For example: Is the sand other than the rocks? That is, is the sand perhaps nothing but a great number of very tiny stones? Is the moon a great rock? If we understood rocks, would we  also understand the 23 2 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:01 PM  Page 23 sand and the moon? Is the wind a sloshing of the air analogous to the sloshing motion of the water in the sea? What common features do different movements have? What is common to different kinds of sound? How many different colors are there? And so on. In this way we try gradually to analyze all things, to put together things which at ﬁrst sight look different, with the hope that we may be able to  reduce  the number of  different  things and thereby under- stand them better. A few hundred years ago, a method was devised to ﬁnd partial answers to such questions.  Observation, reason,  and  experiment make up what we call the  scientiﬁc method.  We shall have to limit ourselves to a bare description of our basic view of what is some- times called  fundamental physics,  or fundamental ideas which have arisen from the application of the scientiﬁc method. What do we mean by “understanding” something? We can imag- ine that this complicated array of moving things which constitutes “the world” is something like a great chess game being played by the gods, and we are observers of the game. We do not know what the rules of the game are; all we are allowed to do is to  watch  the playing.======================================================== ultimately, not understood. It is understood that if something is pushing something else, it snaps and will slide—that is all right. But what pushes, and why? The theory is that there are currents inside the earth—circulating currents, due to the difference in temperature inside and outside—which, in their motion, push the surface slightly. Thus if there are two op- posite circulations next to each other, the matter will collect in 62 Six Easy Pieces 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:01 PM  Page 62 the region where they meet and make belts of mountains which are in unhappy stressed conditions, and so produce volcanoes and earthquakes. What about the inside of the earth? A great deal is known about the speed of earthquake waves through the earth and the density of distribution of the earth. However, physicists have been unable to get a good theory as to how dense a substance should be at the pressures that would be expected at the center of the earth. In other words, we cannot ﬁgure out the properties of matter very well in these circumstances. We do much less well with the earth than we do with the conditions of matter in the stars. The math- ematics involved seems a little too difficult, so far, but perhaps it will not be too long before someone realizes that it is an important problem, and really works it out. The other aspect, of course, is that even if we did know the density, we cannot ﬁgure out the cir- culating currents. Nor can we really work out the properties of rocks at high pressure. We cannot tell how fast the rocks should “give”; that must all be worked out by experiment. Psychology Next, we consider the science of  psychology.  Incidentally, psycho- analysis is not a science: it is at best a medical process, and perhaps even more like witch-doctoring. It has a theory as to what causes disease—lots of different “spirits,” etc. The witch doctor has a theory that a disease like malaria is caused by a spirit which comes into the air; it is not cured by shaking a snake over it, but quinine does help malaria. So, if you are sick, I would advise that you go to the witch doctor because he is the man in the tribe who knows the most about the disease; on the other hand, his knowledge is not science. Psychoanalysis has not been checked carefully by ex- periment, and there is no way to ﬁnd a list of the number of cases in which it works, the number of cases in which it does not work, etc. 63 The Relation of Physics to Other Sciences 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:01 PM  Page 63 The other branches of psychology, which involve things like the physiology of sensation—what happens in the eye, and what hap- pens in the brain—are, if you wish, less interesting. But some small but real progress has been made in studying them. One of the most interesting technical problems may or may not be called psychol- ogy. The central problem of the mind, if you will, or the nervous system, is this: when an animal learns something, it can do some- thing different than it could before, and its brain cell must have changed too, if it is made out of atoms.  In what way is it different? We do not know where to look, or what to look for, when some- thing is memorized. We do not know what it means, or what change there is in the nervous system, when a fact is learned. This is a very important problem which has not been solved at all. As- suming, however, that there is some kind of memory thing, the brain is such an enormous mass of interconnecting wires and nerves that it probably cannot be analyzed in a straightforward manner. There is an analog of this to computing machines and computing elements, in that they also have a lot of lines, and they have some kind of element, analogous, perhaps, to the synapse, or connection of one nerve to another. This is a very interesting subject which we have not the time to discuss further—the relationship between thinking and computing machines. It must be appreciated, of course, that this subject will tell us very little about the real com- plexities of ordinary human behavior. All human beings are so dif- ferent. It will be a long time before we get there. We must start much further back. If we could even ﬁgure out how a  dog  works, we would have gone pretty far. Dogs are easier to understand, but nobody yet knows how dogs work. How did it get that way? In order for physics to be useful to other sciences in a  theoretical way, other than in the invention of instruments, the science in question must supply to the physicist a description of the object in 64 Six Easy Pieces 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:01 PM  Page 64 a physicist’s language. They can say “why does a frog jump?,” and the physicist cannot answer. If they tell him what a frog is, that there are so many molecules, there is a nerve here, etc., that is dif- ferent. If they will tell us, more or less, what the earth or the stars are like, then we can ﬁgure it out. In order for physical theory to be of any======================================================== reversible machines, because every time we move a large clump of stuff, the atoms do not remain absolutely undisturbed, and so a 82 Six Easy Pieces 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:01 PM  Page 82 certain amount of random motion goes into the atomic system. We cannot see it, but we can measure it with thermometers, etc.) There are many other forms of energy, and of course we cannot describe them in any more detail just now. There is electrical energy, which has to do with pushing and pulling by electric charges. There is radiant energy, the energy of light, which we know is a form of electrical energy because light can be represented as wigglings in the electromagnetic ﬁeld. There is chemical energy, the energy which is released in chemical reactions. Actually, elastic energy is, to a certain extent, like chemical energy, because chemical energy is the energy of the attraction of the atoms, one for the other, and so is elastic energy. Our modern understanding is the following: chemical energy has two parts, kinetic energy of the electrons inside the atoms, so part of it is kinetic, and electrical energy of interaction of the electrons and the protons—the rest of it, therefore, is elec- trical. Next we come to nuclear energy, the energy which is involved with the arrangement of particles inside the nucleus, and we have formulas for that, but we do not have the fundamental laws. We know that it is not electrical, not gravitational, and not purely chemical, but we do not know what it is. It seems to be an addi- tional form of energy. Finally, associated with the relativity theory, there is a modiﬁcation of the laws of kinetic energy, or whatever you wish to call it, so that kinetic energy is combined with another thing called  mass energy.  An object has energy from its sheer  existence.  If I have a positron and an electron, standing still doing nothing—never mind gravity, never mind anything—and they come together and disappear, radiant energy will be liberated, in a deﬁnite amount, and the amount can be calculated. All we need know is the mass of the object. It does not depend on what it is—we make two things disappear, and we get a certain amount of energy. The formula was ﬁrst found by Einstein; it is  E  =  mc 2 . It is obvious from our discussion that the law of conservation of energy is enormously useful in making analyses, as we have illus- trated in a few examples without knowing all the formulas. If we 83 Conservation of Energy 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:01 PM  Page 83 had all the formulas for all kinds of energy, we could analyze how many processes should work without having to go into the details. Therefore conservation laws are very interesting. The question nat- urally arises as to what other conservation laws there are in physics. There are two other conservation laws which are analogous to the conservation of energy. One is called the conservation of linear mo- mentum. The other is called the conservation of angular momen- tum. We will ﬁnd out more about these later. In the last analysis, we do not understand the conservation laws deeply. We do not un- derstand the conservation of energy. We do not understand energy as a certain number of little blobs. You may have heard that pho- tons come out in blobs and that the energy of a photon is Planck’s constant times the frequency. That is true, but since the frequency of light can be anything, there is no law that says that energy has to be a certain deﬁnite amount. Unlike Dennis’s blocks, there can be any amount of energy, at least as presently understood. So we do not understand this energy as counting something at the mo- ment, but just as a mathematical quantity, which is an abstract and rather peculiar circumstance. In quantum mechanics it turns out that the conservation of energy is very closely related to another important property of the world,  things do not depend on the absolute time.  We can set up an experiment at a given moment and try it out, and then do the same experiment at a later moment, and it will behave in exactly the same way. Whether this is strictly true or not, we do not know. If we assume that it  is  true, and add the prin- ciples of quantum mechanics, then we can deduce the principle of the conservation of energy. It is a rather subtle and interesting thing, and it is not easy to explain. The other conservation laws are also linked together. The conservation of momentum is associated in quantum mechanics with the proposition that it makes no dif- ference  where  you do the experiment, the results will always be the same. As independence in space has to do with the conservation of momentum, independence of time has to do with the conservation of energy, and ﬁnally, if we  turn  our apparatus, this too makes no difference, and so the invariance of the world to angular orientation 84 Six Easy Pieces 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:01 PM  Page 84 is related to the conservation of  angular======================================================== and Saturn, all was well, but Uranus was “weird.” It behaved in a very peculiar manner.

They did pay attention to Le Ver- rier; they looked, and there planet  N  was! The other observatory then also looked very quickly in the next few days and saw it too. 100 Six Easy Pieces 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:01 PM  Page 100 This discovery shows that Newton’s laws are absolutely right in the solar system, but do they extend beyond the relatively small dis- tances of the nearest planets?

Figure 5-6 shows a double star— two stars very close together (there is also a third star in the picture so that we will know that the photograph was not turned).

There we see a beautiful ellipse, the measures starting in 1862 and going all the way around to 1904 (by now it must have gone around once more). Everything coincides with Newton’s laws, except that the star Sirius A is  not at the focus.  Why should that be? Because the plane of the ellipse is not in the “plane of the sky.” We are not looking at right angles to the orbit plane, and when an ellipse is viewed at a tilt, it remains an ellipse but the focus is no longer at the same place. Thus we can analyze double stars, moving about each other, according to the requirements of the gravitational law. 101 The Theory of Gravitation Figure 5-6 A double-star system. 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:01 PM  Page 101 That the law of gravitation is true at even bigger distances is indi- cated in Fig. 5-8.

(Incidentally, if you are looking for a good problem, the exact details of how the arms are formed and what determines the shapes of these galaxies have not been worked out.) It is, however, clear that the shape of the galaxy is due to gravi- tation even though the complexities of its structure have not yet al- lowed us to analyze it completely. In a galaxy we have a scale of perhaps 50,000 to 10 0,000 light-years. The earth’s distance from the sun is 8 1 / 3 light- minutes,  so you can see how large these dimensions are. Gravity appears to exist at even bigger dimensions, as indicated by Fig. 5-10, which shows many “little” things clustered together. This is a  cluster of galaxies,  just like a star cluster. Thus galaxies at- tract each other at such distances that they too are======================================================== 30, 38, 40 Psychology, physics and, 63–  64 Quantum behavior atomic mechanics, 115–  17 bullets, experiment with, 117– 19 electron waves, interference of, 124–  27 electrons, experiment with, 122– 24,  127– 33 waves, experiment with, 120– 22 Quantum chemistry, 49 Quantum electrodynamics (QED), x, 37–  38, 43–  44 Quantum mechanics of chemistry, 26, 48 deﬁned, 116 ﬁrst principles of, 133–  36 144 Index 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:01 PM  Page 144 gravitation and, 113 properties of, 33–  38 uncertainty principle, 136–  38 Radar waves, 32 Radiant energy, 71, 83 Radio waves, 31 Radius vector, 91 Reason, scientiﬁc method and, 24 Relativity gravity and, 112–  13 theory of, 43 Reproduction, 57–  59 Repulsion, electrical force and, 28 Resonances, 40, 42 Respiratory cycle, 52 Reversible machines, 73–  76 Ribosomes, 58, 59 RNA, 58–  59 “Rules of the game,” 24–  25 S number, particles, 40 Salt, dissolving in water, 13–  15 Sands, Prof. Matthew, xxviii Schwinger, Julian, xxii Scientiﬁc method, 24 Screw jack, 78 Sensation, physiology of, 64 Short-range interaction force, 28 Sigma baryons, 41, 42 Sodium chloride, 13 Solids atomic hypothesis, 9 dissolving in water, 13–  15 Solution, precipitation and, 14 Sound, waves of excess density and, 28 Space, conservation of momentum, 84, 85 Space, time and, 27, 33, 44 Stars, 59–  61, 65–  66, 101–  4 Statistical mechanics, 48–  49, 60 Steam, atomic hypothesis, 6–  8 Steam engines, 71 Stevinus, 78 “Strangeness” number, particles, 40, 42 Strong particle interactions, 43– 44 Substances, properties of, 26 Sun, planetary motion and, 90– 92 Symmetry, atoms in ice, 9 Technetium, 60 Temperature, 8–  10 geology and, 62–  63 Thermodynamics, 49, 85 Thermonuclear reactions, 86 Thymine, 57 Tides, pull of the moon and, 97– 98,  99f Time, conservation of energy and, 84, 85 Time, space and, 27, 33 TNT explosion, 38 Tomanaga, Sin-Itero, xxii Torsion ﬁber, 105 Total internal reﬂection, 115 Transpiration, 17 Turbulent ﬂow, 62 Turbulent ﬂuids, 66 Ultraviolet frequencies, 32 Unbalanced electrical force, 29 145 Index 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:01 PM  Page 145 Universal gravitation, 98–  104 Universe, age of, 110–  11 Velocity, kinetic energy and, 81 Vertical motions, 95, 96f Virtual work, principle of, 79 Volcanism, 62–  63 Water atomic hypothesis, 4–  10 dissolving solids in, 13–  15 evaporation, 11–  13 Water vapor, 11–  13, 17 Waves behavior of, 32–  33, 36 electromagnetic, 31–  33 excess density, sound and, 28 quantum behavior experiment with, 120–  22 Weak decay particle interactions, 43– 44 Weather, 61–  62, 66 Weight-lifting machines, 72–  76 Work, virtual, 79 X-rays, 26, 32–  33 Yukawa, 38–39 Zero-charge particles, 40 Zero mass, 43 Zero-mass particles, 40 146 Index 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:01 PM  Page 146
