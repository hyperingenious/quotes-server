======================================================== socrates: I do? hermes: Of  course. Have you yourself not often been misunderstood,  even by people trying hard to understand you? socrates: Yes. hermes:  Have you, in turn, not often misunderstood what someone  means, even when he is trying to tell you as clearly as he can? socrates:  Indeed I have. Not least during this conversation!  hermes: W ell, this is not an attribute of philosophical ideas only, but  of all ideas. Remember when you all got lost on your way here from  the ship? And why? socrates: It  was because – as we realized with hindsight – we  completely misunderstood the directions given to us by the captain. hermes: So,  when you got the wrong idea of what he meant, despite  having listened attentively to every word he said,  where did that  wrong idea come from ? Not from him, presumably . . . socrates: I  see. It must come from within ourselves. It must be a  guess. Though, until this moment, it had never even remotely occurred  to me that I had been guessing. hermes: So  why would you expect that anything different happens  when you do understand someone correctly? socrates: I  see. When we hear something being said, we  guess  what  it means, without realizing what we are doing. That is beginning to  make sense to me.      Except – guesswork isn’t knowledge!  hermes:  Indeed, most guesses are not new knowledge. Although  guesswork is the  origin  of all knowledge, it is also a source of error,  and therefore what happens to an idea  after  it has been guessed is  crucial. socrates: So –  let me combine that insight with what I know of  240 the beginning of infinity criticism. A guess might come from a dream, or it might just be a  wild speculation or random combination of ideas, or anything. But  then we do not just accept it blindly or because we imagine it is  ‘authorized’, or because we  want  it to be true. Instead we criticize  it and try to discover its flaws. hermes: Yes.  That is what you  should  do, at any rate. socrates:  Then we try to remedy those flaws by altering the idea,  or dropping it in favour of others – and the alterations and other  ideas are themselves guesses. And are themselves criticized. Only  when we fail in these attempts either to reject or to improve an idea  do we provisionally accept it. hermes:  That can work. Unfortunately, people do not always do  what can work. socrates: Thank you, Hermes. It is exciting to learn of this single  process through which all knowledge originates, whether it is our  knowledge of a sea captain’s directions to Delphi, or knowledge of  right and wrong that we have carefully refined for years, or theorems  of arithmetic or geometry – or epistemology revealed to us by a    god – hermes: It  all comes from within, from conjecture and criticism. socrates: W ait! It comes from within,  even if revealed by a god ? hermes:  And is just as fallible as ever. Yes. Your argument covers that  case just like any other. socrates:  Marvellous! But now – what about objects that we just  experience  in the natural world. We reach out and touch an object,  and hence experience it  out there.  Surely that is a different kind of  knowledge, a kind which – fallible or not – really does come from  without, at least in the sense that our own experience is out there,  at the location of the object.* hermes: You  loved the idea that all those other different kinds of  knowledge originate in the same way, and are improved in the same  way. Why is ‘direct’ sensory experience an exception? What if it just  seems  radically different?  *The ancient Greeks were not very clear about where sensory experiences are located.  Even in the case of vision, many in Socrates’ time believed that the eye  emits  some- thing like light, and that the sensation of seeing an object consists of some sort of  interaction between the object and that light. 241 A Dream of Socrates socrates:  But surely you are now asking me to believe in a sort of  all-encompassing conjuring trick, resembling the fanciful notion that  the whole of life is really a dream. For it would mean that the  sensation of touching an object does not happen where we experience  it happening, namely in the hand that touches, but in the mind –  which I believe is located somewhere in the brain. So all my sen  - sations of touch are located inside my skull, where in reality nothing  can touch while I still live. And whenever I think I am seeing a vast,  brilliantly illuminated landscape, all that I am really experiencing    is likewise located entirely inside my skull, where in reality it is  constantly dark! hermes: Is  that so absurd? Where do you think all the sights and  sounds of  this   dream  are located? socrates: I  accept that  they  are indeed in my mind. But that is my  point: most dreams portray things that are simply not there in the  external reality. To portray things that  are  there is surely impossible  without some input that does not come from the mind but from  those things======================================================== celebrates Persephone’s revenge and the  anniversary of her escape by commanding plants to grow and adorn  the Earth. This myth accounts for the same observations as the original,  and it is testable (and in fact refuted) by the same observations. Yet  what it asserts about reality is markedly different from – in many ways  it is the opposite of – the original myth. Every other detail of the story, apart from its bare prediction that  winter happens once a year, is just as easily variable. So, although the  myth was created to explain the seasons, it is only superficially adapted  to that purpose. When its author was wondering what could possibly  make a goddess do something once a year, he did not shout, ‘Eureka!  It must have been a marriage contract enforced by a magic seed.’ He  made that choice – and all his substantive choices as author – for  cultural and artistic reasons, and not because of the attributes of winter  at all. He may also have been trying to explain aspects of human nature  metaphorically – but here I am concerned with the myth only in its  capacity as an explanation  of seasons , and in that respect even its  21 The Reach of Explanations author could not have denied that the role of all the details could be  played equally well by countless other things. The Persephone and Freyr myths assert radically incompatible things  about what is happening in reality to cause seasons. Yet no one, I guess,  has ever adopted either myth as a result of comparing it on its merits  with the other, because there is no way of distinguishing between them.  If we ignore all the parts of both myths whose role could be easily  replaced, we are left with the same core explanation in both cases:  the  gods did it . Although Freyr is a very different god of spring from  Persephone, and his battles very different events from her conjugal  visits, none of those differing attributes has any function in the myths’  respective accounts of why seasons happen. Hence none of them  provides any reason for choosing one explanation over the other. The reason those myths are so easily variable is that their details are  barely connected to the details of the phenomena. Nothing in the  problem of why winter happens is addressed by postulating specifically  a marriage contract or a magic seed, or the gods Persephone, Hades  and Demeter – or Freyr. Whenever a wide range of variant theories can  account equally well for the phenomenon they are trying to explain,  there is no reason to prefer one of them over the others, so advocating  a particular one in preference to the others is irrational.  That freedom to make drastic changes in those mythical explanations  of seasons is the fundamental flaw in them. It is the reason that myth- making in general is not an effective way to understand the world. And  that is so whether the myths are testable or not, for whenever it is easy  to vary an explanation without changing its predictions, one could just  as easily vary it to make different predictions if they were needed. For  example, if the ancient Greeks  had  discovered that the seasons in the  northern and southern hemispheres are out of phase, they would have  had a choice of countless slight variants of the myth that would be  consistent with that observation. One would be that when Demeter is  sad she banishes warmth  from her vicinity , and it has to go elsewhere  – into the southern hemisphere. Similarly, slight variants of the Perse- phone explanation could account just as well for seasons that were  marked by green rainbows, or seasons that happened once a week, or  sporadically, or not at all. Likewise for the superstitious gambler or  the end-of-the-world prophet: when their theory is refuted by experience,  22 the beginning of infinity they do indeed switch to a new one; but, because their underlying  explanations are bad, they can easily accommodate the new experience  without changing the substance of the explanation. Without a good  explanatory theory, they can simply reinterpret the omens, pick a new  date, and make essentially the same prediction. In such cases, testing  one’s theory and abandoning it when it is refuted constitutes no  progress towards understanding the world. If an explanation could  easily explain anything in the given field, then it actually explains  nothing. In general, when theories are easily variable in the sense I have  described, experimental testing is almost useless for correcting their  errors. I call such theories  bad explanations.  Being proved wrong by  experiment, and changing the theories to other bad explanations, does  not get their holders one jot closer to the truth.  Because explanation plays this central role in science, and because  testability is of little use in the case of bad explanations, I myself prefer  to call myths, superstitions and similar theories  un scientific even when  they make testable predictions. But it does not matter what terminology  you use, so======================================================== which I mean identical in literally every way except that there are  two of them. The concept of fungibility is going to appear repeatedly  in my story. The term is borrowed from legal terminology, where it  refers to the legal fiction that  deems  certain entities to be identical for  purposes such as paying debts. For example, dollar bills are fungible  in law, which means that, unless otherwise agreed, borrowing a dollar  does not require one to return the specific banknote that one borrowed.  Barrels of oil (of a given grade) are fungible too. Horses are not:  borrowing someone’s horse means that one has to return that specific  horse; even its identical twin will not do. But the physical fungibility  I am referring to here is not about deeming. It means  being  identical,  and that is a very different and counter-intuitive property. Leibniz, in  266 the beginning of infinity his doctrine of ‘the identity of indiscernibles’, went so far as to rule  out its existence on principle. But he was mistaken. Even aside from  the physics of the multiverse, we now know that photons, and under  some conditions even atoms, can be fungible. This is achieved in lasers  and in devices called ‘atomic lasers’ respectively. The latter emit bursts  of extremely cold, fungible atoms. For how this is possible without  causing transmutation, explosions and so on, see below.  You will not find the concept of fungibility discussed or even  mentioned in many textbooks or research papers on quantum theory,  even the small minority that endorse the many-universes interpretation.  Nevertheless, it is everywhere just beneath the conceptual surface, and  I believe that making it explicit helps to explain quantum phenomena  without fudging. As will become clear, it is an even weirder attribute  than Leibniz guessed – much weirder than multiple universes for  instance, which are, after all, just common sense, repeated. It allows  radically new types of  motion  and  information flow , different from  anything that was imagined before quantum physics, and hence a  radically different structure of the physical world. It so happens that, in some situations, money is not only legally  fungible but physically too; and, being so familiar, it provides a good  model for thinking about fungibility. For example, if the balance in  your (electronic) bank account is one dollar, and the bank adds a second  dollar as a loyalty bonus and later withdraws a dollar in charges, there  is no meaning to whether the dollar they withdrew is the one that was  there originally or the one that they had added – or is composed of a  little of each. It is not merely that  we   cannot know  whether it was the  same dollar, or have decided not to care: because of the physics of the  situation there really is no such thing as taking the original dollar, nor  such a thing as taking the one added subsequently.  Dollars in bank accounts are what may be called ‘configurational’  entities: they are states or configurations of objects, not what we usually  think of as physical objects in their own right. Your bank balance  resides in the  state  of a certain information-storage device. In a sense  you own that state (it is illegal for anyone to alter it without your  consent), but you do not own the device itself or any part of it. So in  that sense a dollar is an abstraction. Indeed, it is a piece of  abstract  knowledge . As I discussed in Chapter 4, knowledge, once embodied  267 The Multiverse in physical form in a suitable environment, causes itself to remain so.  And thus, when a physical dollar wears out and is destroyed by the  mint, the abstract dollar causes the mint to transfer it into electronic  form, or into a new instance in paper form. It is an abstract replicator  – though, unusually for a replicator, it causes itself  not  to proliferate,  but rather to be copied into ledgers and into backups of computer  memories. Another example of fungible configurational entities in classical  physics is amounts of energy: if you pedal your bicycle until you have  built up a kinetic energy of ten kilojoules, and then brake until half  that energy has been dissipated as heat, there is no meaning to whether  the energy dissipated was the first five kilojoules that you had added  or the second, or any combination. But it is meaningful that  half  the  energy that was there has been dissipated. It turns out that, in quantum  physics, elementary particles are configurational entities too. The  vacuum, which we perceive as empty at everyday scales and even at  atomic scales, is not really emptiness, but a richly structured entity  known as a ‘quantum field’. Elementary particles are higher-energy  configurations of this entity: ‘excitations of the vacuum’. So, for in    - stance, the photons in a laser are configurations of the vacuum inside  its ‘cavity’. When two or more such excitations with identical attributes  (such as energy and spin) are present in the cavity, there======================================================== that, if children fear  it, they will grow up to make  their  children fear it, then the behaviour  of telling stories about that type of hobgoblin is a meme. Suppose it  is a rational meme. Then criticism, over generations, will cast doubt  on the story’s truth. Since in reality there are no hobgoblins, the meme  might evolve away to extinction. Note that it does not ‘care’ if it goes  extinct. Memes do what they have to do: they have no intentions, even  about themselves. But there are also other paths that it might evolve  down. It might become overtly fictional. Because rational memes must  be seen as beneficial by the holders, those that evoke unpleasant  emotions are at a disadvantage, so it may also evolve away from  evoking terror and towards, for instance, being pleasantly thrilling – or  else (if it settled on a genuine danger) exploring practicalities for the  present and optimism for the future. Now suppose it is an anti-rational meme. Evoking unpleasant  emotions will then be useful in doing the harm that it needs to do –  namely disabling the listener’s ability to be rid of the hobgoblin and  entrenching the compulsion to think and therefore speak of it. The  more accurately the hobgoblin’s attributes exploit genuine, widespread  vulnerabilities of the human mind, the more faithfully the anti-rational  meme will propagate. If the meme is to survive for many generations,  it is essential that its implicit knowledge of these vulnerabilities be  true and deep. But its overt content – the idea of the hobgoblin’s  existence – need contain no truth. On the contrary, the non-existence  of the hobgoblin helps to make the meme a better replicator, be            -  cause the story is then unconstrained by the mundane attributes of    any genuine menace, which are always finite and to some degree  combatable. And that will be all the more so if the story can also  manage to undermine the principle of optimism. Thus, just as rational  memes evolve towards deep truths, anti-rational memes evolve away  from them. As usual, mixing the above two replication strategies does no good.  If a meme contains true and beneficial knowledge for the recipient, but  disables the recipient’s critical faculties in regard to itself, then the  recipient will be less able to correct errors in that knowledge, and so  will reduce the faithfulness of transmission. And if a meme relies on  the recipients’ belief that it is beneficial, but it is not in fact beneficial,  390 the beginning of infinity then that increases the chance that the recipient will reject it or refuse  to enact it. Similarly, a rational meme’s natural home is a dynamic society – more  or less any dynamic society – because there the tradition of criticism  (optimistically directed at problem-solving) will suppress variants of  the meme with even slightly less truth. Moreover, the rapid progress  will subject these variants to continually varying criteria of criticism,  which again only deeply true memes have a chance of surviving. An  anti-rational meme’s natural home is a static society – not any static  society, but preferably the one in which it evolved – for all the converse  reasons. And therefore each type of meme, when present in a society  that is broadly of the  opposite  kind, is less able to cause itself to be  replicated. The Enlightenment Our society in the West became dynamic not through the sudden failure  of a static society, but through generations of static-society-type evo  - lution. Where and when the transition began is not very well defined,  but I suspect that it began with the philosophy of Galileo and perhaps  became irreversible with the discoveries of Newton. In meme terms,  Newton’s laws replicated themselves as rational memes, and their  fidelity was very high – because they were so useful for so many  purposes. This success made it increasingly difficult to ignore the  philosophical implications of the fact that nature had been understood  in unprecedented depth, and of the methods of science and reason by  which this had been achieved. In any case, following Newton, there was no way of missing the fact  that rapid progress was under way. (Some philosophers, notably Jean- Jacques Rousseau, did try – but only by arguing that reason was  harmful, civilization bad and primitive life happy.) There was such an  avalanche of further improvements – scientific, philosophical and  political – that the possibility of resuming stasis was swept away.  Western society would become the beginning of infinity or be destroyed.  Nations beyond the West today are also changing rapidly, sometimes  through the exigencies of warfare with their neighbours, but more  often and even more powerfully by the peaceful transmission of Western  391 The Evolution of Culture memes. Their cultures, too, cannot become static again. They must  either become ‘Western’ in their mode of operation or lose all their  knowledge and thus cease to exist – a dilemma which is======================================================== be, the purpose of science. Consider an audience watching  a conjuring trick. The problem facing them has much the same logic  as a scientific problem. Although in nature there is no conjurer trying  to deceive us intentionally, we can be mystified in both cases for  essentially the same reason: appearances are not self-explanatory. If  the explanation of a conjuring trick were evident in its appearance,  there would be no trick. If the explanations of physical phenomena  were evident in their appearance, empiricism would be true and there  would be no need for science as we know it. The problem is not to predict the trick’s appearance. I may, for  instance, predict that if a conjurer seems to place various balls under  various cups, those cups will later appear to be empty; and I may  predict that if the conjurer appears to saw someone in half, that person  15 The Reach of Explanations will later appear on stage unharmed. Those are testable predictions. I  may experience many conjuring shows and see my predictions vindi- cated every time. But that does not even address, let alone solve, the  problem of how the trick works. Solving it requires an explanation: a  statement of the reality that accounts for the appearance. Some people may enjoy conjuring tricks without ever wanting to  know how they work. Similarly, during the twentieth century, most  philosophers, and many scientists, took the view that science is incapable  of discovering anything about reality. Starting from empiricism, they  drew the inevitable conclusion (which would nevertheless have horrified  the early empiricists) that science cannot validly do more than predict  the outcomes of observations, and that it should never purport to  describe the reality that brings those outcomes about. This is known as  instrumentalism.  It denies that what I have been calling ‘explanation’  can exist at all. It is still very influential. In some fields (such as statistical  analysis) the very word ‘explanation’ has come to mean prediction, so  that a mathematical formula is said to ‘explain’ a set of experimental  data. By ‘reality’ is meant merely the  observed data  that the formula is  supposed to approximate. That leaves no term for assertions about  reality itself, except perhaps ‘useful fiction’. Instrumentalism is one of many ways of denying  realism ,   the common- sense, and true, doctrine that the physical world really exists, and is  accessible to rational inquiry. Once one has denied this, the logical  implication is that all claims about reality are equivalent to myths,    none of them being better than the others in any objective sense. That  is  relativism ,   the doctrine that statements in a given field cannot be  objectively true or false: at most they can be judged so relative to some  cultural or other arbitrary standard. Instrumentalism, even aside from the philosophical enormity of  reducing science to a collection of statements about human experiences,  does not make sense in its own terms. For there is no such thing as a  purely predictive, explanationless theory. One cannot make even the  simplest prediction without invoking quite a sophisticated explanatory  framework. For example, those predictions about conjuring tricks  apply specifically to conjuring tricks. That is explanatory information,  and it tells me, among other things, not to ‘extrapolate’ the predictions  to another type of situation, however successful they are at predicting  16 the beginning of infinity conjuring tricks. So I know not to predict that saws in general are  harmless to humans; and I continue to predict that if  I  were to place  a ball under a cup, it really would go there and stay there.  The concept of a conjuring trick, and of the distinction between it  and other situations, is familiar and unproblematic – so much so that it  is easy to forget that it depends on substantive explanatory theories  about all sorts of things such as how our senses work, how solid matter  and light behave, and also subtle cultural details. Knowledge that is both  familiar and uncontroversial is  background knowledge.  A predictive  theory whose explanatory content consists only of back  ground know- ledge is a  rule of thumb . Because we usually take background knowledge  for granted, rules of thumb may seem to be explanationless predictions,  but that is always an illusion.  There is always an explanation, whether we know it or not, for why  a rule of thumb works. Denying that some regularity in nature has an  explanation is effectively the same as believing in the supernatural –  saying, ‘That’s not conjuring, it’s actual magic.’ Also, there is always  an explanation when a rule of thumb  fails , for rules of thumb are  always parochial: they hold only in a narrow range of familiar circum- stances. So, if an unfamiliar feature were introduced into a cups-  and-balls trick, the rule of thumb I stated might easily make a false  prediction. For instance, I could not======================================================== you my best  guess first. So I thought: yes, we already knew he’s the wisest. And  that he’s modest. But we didn’t know quite  how  modest. So that’s  what the god revealed to us! That Socrates is so modest that he’d  contradict even a god saying he’s wise. companions: [ Laugh. ] plato : And another thing:  we  knew of Socrates’ excellence, but now  Apollo has revealed it to  the whole world . 244 the beginning of infinity chaerephon: [ under his breath ] Then I wish ‘the whole world’ had  chipped in for the fee. plato : What was that? Did I get it right? [socrates  draws breath to answer, but  plato  again continues .] Oh, and Socrates, may I call you ‘Master’? socrates: No.  plato : Yes, yes, of course. Sorry. It’s just that I’ve been hanging out  with some Spartan kids at the gymnasium, and they talk like that  all the time. ‘My master says this. My master says that. My master  does not permit . . . ’ and so on and so on. It got so that I became a  bit envious that I don’t have a master myself, so – companion no. 1: Eww,  Plato! plato : Yeah, but –  chaerephon: [ catching up ]  Spartan  kids? Aristocles, that is most  improper. We are at war! plato : Not here in Delphi we’re not. They’d  never  violate the sacred  truce of the Oracle. They’re very devout, you know. Nice kids, despite  their funny accents. We spoke a lot about wrestling – in between  actual wrestling, that is. We were up all night, wrestling by candle- light. I’ve never done that before. They’re really good! Though they  do sometimes cheat as well. [ Smiles indulgently in recollection .] But,  even so, I wasn’t going to let our city be humiliated. I won a few  bouts for Athens, you’ll be glad to know. That was intense! They  taught me some great moves. I can’t wait to try them out back home.  For some reason none of them are much into poetry, though. socrates:  They don’t honour poets in Sparta. Not living ones,  anyway.  plato : Oh! Pity. I dashed off a poem in commemoration of our  wrestling competition. Or rather, between the lines, it’s really about  why Athens is better than Sparta. It’s a mathematical argument . . .  Anyway, I’ve just sent a slave over to their compound to recite it to  them, but if they don’t honour poets perhaps they won’t appreciate  it. Oh well. It goes like this – chaerephon:  Aristocles – last night Socrates was visited by the god  Hermes! plato : Wow! Why didn’t you call us, Socrates? That would have  trumped even wrestling with Spartans!  245 A Dream of Socrates socrates: I  couldn’t call anyone because it happened in a dream – or  something. I’m not even sure that it was really the god. But, as he  pointed out to me, it doesn’t matter. plato : Why not? Oh, I guess that, once the experience is over, all that  matters is what you learned from it. So, what did he want? I bet he  wanted to poach you away from the cult of Apollo. Don’t do it,  Socrates! Apollo is much better. Not that there’s anything  wrong  with Hermes, but he has no Oracle. And he’s not as cool – chaerephon: [ shocked ] Show some respect, Aristocles – to Socrates  and  to the gods! socrates: He  is  showing respect, Chaerephon, in his own way.  plato : [ mystified ] Of course I respect them, Chaerephon. And you  know I’d literally worship Socrates if he’d let me. Oh, and I respect  you too, old man. Greatly. I beg you to forgive me if I have offended  you: I know I get too enthusiastic sometimes. [ Pauses briefly .] But,  Socrates – what did you ask the god and what did he reply? socrates: It  wasn’t quite like that. He came to reveal to me a new  branch of philosophy:  epistemology  – knowledge about knowledge,  which also has implications for morality and other fields. Much of  it I already knew, or partially knew in various special cases. But he  gave me a god’s-eye overview, which was breathtaking. Interestingly,  he mainly did this by asking  me  questions, and inviting  me  to think  about certain things. It seems an effective technique – I may try it  sometime. plato : Tell us everything, Socrates! Start with the most interesting  thing he asked, and your reply. socrates: W ell – one thing he asked me to do was to imagine a  ‘Spartan Socrates’.  plato : A Spartan  what ? Oh! I see!  That  must be whom the Oracle  meant. How sneaky Apollo is! It’s the  Spartan  Socrates who’s the  wisest man in the world – though only by the breadth of a hair, I’ll  bet! But, being Spartan, he’s probably the greatest warrior as well.  Awesome! Of course I know you were a great warrior in your day  too, Socrates. But still – a  Spartan  Socrates! So are we going to Sparta  to see him right away? Please! chaerephon:   Aristocles –  the war! socrates:      Sorry to disappoint you, Aristocles, but it was a  246 the beginning of infinity purely intellectual exercise. There is no ‘Spartan Socrates’. In fact I  know of no Spartan philosophers at all. In a way, that is what much  of my conversation with Hermes was about. plato : Please tell us more. [ While======================================================== (like a projectile that has exceeded  escape velocity) or whether it would eventually recollapse in a ‘Big  Crunch’. Those were believed to be the only two possibilities. I discus- sed them in  The Fabric of Reality  because they were relevant to the  question: is there a bound on the number of computational steps that  a computer can execute during the lifetime of the universe? If there is,  then physics will also impose a bound on the amount of knowledge  that can be created – knowledge-creation being a form of computation. Everyone’s first thought was that unbounded knowledge-creation is  possible only in a universe that does not recollapse. However, on  analysis it turned out that the reverse is true: in universes that expand  for ever, the inhabitants would run out of energy. But the cosmologist  Frank Tipler discovered that in certain types of recollapsing universes  the Big Crunch singularity is suitable for performing the faster-and- faster trick that we used in Infinity Hotel: an infinite sequence of  computational steps could be executed in a finite time before the  singularity, powered by the ever-increasing tidal effects of the gravi- tational collapse itself. To the inhabitants – who would eventually have  to upload their personalities into computers made of something like  pure tides – the universe would last for ever because they would be  thinking faster and faster, without limit, as it collapsed, and storing  their memories in ever smaller volumes so that access times could also  451 The Beginning be reduced without limit. Tipler called such universes ‘omega-point  universes’. At the time, the observational evidence was consistent with  the real universe being of that type. A small part of the revolution that is currently overtaking cosmology  is that the omega-point models have been ruled out by observation.  Evidence – including a remarkable series of studies of supernovae in  distant galaxies – has forced cosmologists to the unexpected conclusion  that the universe not only will expand for ever but has been expanding  at an accelerating rate.  Something has been counteracting its gravity.  We do not know what. Pending the discovery of a good explanation,  the unknown cause has been named ‘dark energy’. There are several  proposals for what it might be, including effects that merely give the  appearance of acceleration. But the best working hypothesis at present  is that in the equations for gravity there is an additional term, of a  form first mooted by Einstein in 1915 and then dropped because he  realized that his explanation for it was bad. It was proposed again in  the 1980s as a possible effect of quantum field theory, but again there  is no theory of the physical meaning of such a term that is good enough  to predict, for instance, its magnitude. The problem of the nature and  effects of dark energy is no minor detail, nor does anything about it  suggest a perpetually unfathomable mystery. So much for cosmology  being a fundamentally completed science. Depending on what dark energy turns out to be, it may well be  possible to harness it in the distant future, to provide energy for  knowledge-creation to continue for ever. Because this energy would  have to be collected over ever greater distances, the computation would  have to become ever slower. In a mirror image of what would happen  in omega-point cosmologies, the inhabitants of the universe would  notice no slowdown, because, again, they would be instantiated as  computer programs whose total number of steps would be unbounded.  Thus dark energy, which has ruled out one scenario for the unlimited  growth of knowledge, would provide the literal driving force of another. The new cosmological models describe universes that are infinite in  their spatial dimensions. Because the Big Bang happened a finite time  ago, and because of the finiteness of the speed of light, we shall only  ever see a finite portion of infinite space – but that portion will continue  to grow for ever. Thus, eventually, ever more unlikely phenomena will  452 the beginning of infinity come into view. When the total volume that we can see is a million  times larger than it is now, we shall see things that have a probability  of one in a million of existing in space as we see it today. Everything  physically possible will eventually be revealed: watches that came into  existence spontaneously; asteroids that happen to be good likenesses  of William Paley; everything. According to the prevailing theory, all  those things  exist today , but many times too far away for light to have  reached us from them – yet. Light becomes fainter as it spreads out: there are fewer photons per  unit area. That means that ever larger telescopes are needed to detect  a given object at ever larger distances. So there may be a limit to how  distant – and therefore how unlikely – a phenomenon we shall ever be  able to see. Except, that is, for one type of phenomenon: a beginning  of======================================================== It may seem strange that scientific instruments bring us closer to reality  when in purely physical terms they only ever separate us further from  it. But we observe nothing directly anyway. All observation is theory- laden. Likewise, whenever we make an error, it is an error in the  explanation of something. That is why appearances can be deceptive,  and it is also why we, and our instruments, can correct for that decep- tiveness. The growth of knowledge consists of correcting misconceptions  in our theories. Edison said that research is one per cent inspiration and  ninety-nine per cent perspiration – but that is misleading, because people  can apply creativity even to tasks that computers and other machines  do uncreatively. So science is not mindless toil for which rare moments  of discovery are the compensation: the toil can be creative, and fun, just  as the discovery of new explanations is. Now, can this creativity – and this fun – continue indefinitely? 42 3 The Spark Most ancient accounts of the reality beyond our everyday experience  were not only false, they had a radically different character from modern  ones: they were  anthropocentric . That is to say, they centred on human  beings, and more broadly on  people  – entities with intentions and  human-like thoughts – which included powerful, supernatural people  such as spirits and gods. So, winter might be attributed to someone’s  sadness, harvests to someone’s generosity, natural disasters to someone’s  anger, and so on. Such explanations often involved cosmically significant  beings caring what humans did, or having intentions about them. This  conferred cosmic significance on humans too. Then the geocentric theory  placed humans at the physical hub of the universe as well. Those two  kinds of anthropocentrism – explanatory and geometrical – made each  other more plausible, and, as a result, pre-Enlightenment thinking was  more anthropocentric than we can readily imagine nowadays.  A notable exception was the science of geometry itself, especially  the system developed by the ancient Greek mathematician Euclid. Its  elegant axioms and modes of reasoning about impersonal entities such  as points and lines would later be an inspiration to many of the pioneers  of the Enlightenment. But until then it had little impact on prevailing  world views. For example, most astronomers were also astrologers:  despite using sophisticated geometry in their work, they believed that  the stars foretold political and personal events on Earth.  Before anything was known about how the world works, trying    to explain physical phenomena in terms of purposeful, human-like  thought and action may have been a reasonable approach. After all,  that is how we explain much of our everyday experience even today:  if a jewel is mysteriously missing from a locked safe, we seek human- 43 The Spark level explanations such as error or theft (or, under some circumstances,  conjuring), not new laws of physics. But that anthropocentric approach  has never yielded any good explanations beyond the realm of human  affairs. In regard to the physical world at large, it was colossally  misconceived. We now know that the patterns of stars and planets in  our night sky have no significance for human affairs. We know that  we are not at the centre of the universe – it does not even have a  geometrical centre. And we know that, although some of the titanic  astrophysical phenomena that I have described played a significant  role in our past, we have never been significant to them. We call a  phenomenon  significant  (or  fundamental ) if parochial theories are  inadequate to explain it, or if it appears in the explanation of many  other phenomena; so it may seem that human beings and their wishes  and actions are extremely insignificant in the universe at large. Anthropocentric misconceptions have also been overturned in every  other fundamental area of science: our knowledge of physics is now  expressed entirely in terms of entities that are as impersonal as Euclid’s  points and lines, such as elementary particles, forces and spacetime – a  four-dimensional continuum with three dimensions of space and one  of time. Their effects on each other are explained not in terms of feelings  and intentions, but through mathematical equations expressing laws  of nature. In biology, it was once thought that living things must have  been designed by a supernatural person, and that they must contain  some special ingredient, a ‘vital principle’, to make them behave with  apparent purposefulness. But biological science discovered new modes  of explanation through such impersonal things as chemical reactions,  genes and evolution. So we now know that living things, including  humans, all consist of the same ingredients as rocks and stars, and    obey the same laws, and that they were not designed by anyone.

Creativity  The capacity to create new explanations. Empiricism   The misconception that we ‘derive’ all our knowledge  from sensory experience. Theory-laden   There is no such thing as ‘raw’ experience. All our  experience of the world comes through layers of conscious and  unconscious interpretation. Inductivism   The misconception that scientific theories are obtained  by generalizing or extrapolating repeated experiences, and that the  31 The Reach of Explanations more often a theory is confirmed by observation the more likely it  becomes. Induction   The non-existent process of ‘obtaining’ referred to above. Principle of induction   The idea that ‘the future will resemble the past’,  combined with the misconception that this asserts anything about  the future. Realism  The idea that the physical world exists in reality, and that  knowledge of it can exist too. Relativism  The misconception that statements cannot be objectively  true or false, but can be judged only relative to some cultural or  other arbitrary standard. Instrumentalism  The misconception that science cannot describe  reality, only predict outcomes of observations. Justificationism  The misconception that knowledge can be genuine  or reliable only if it is justified by some source or criterion. Fallibilism  The recognition that there are no authoritative sources of  knowledge, nor any reliable means of justifying knowledge as true  or probable. Background knowledge   Familiar and currently uncontroversial  knowledge. Rule of thumb   ‘Purely predictive theory’ (theory whose explanatory  content is all background knowledge). Problem  A problem exists when a conflict between ideas is ex    - perienced. Good/bad explanation   An explanation that is hard/easy to vary while  still accounting for what it purports to account for. The Enlightenment   (The beginning of) a way of pursuing knowledge  with a tradition of criticism and seeking good explanations instead  of reliance on authority. Mini-enlightenment   A short-lived tradition of criticism. Rational   Attempting to solve problems by seeking good explanations;  actively pursuing error-correction by creating criticisms of both  existing ideas and new proposals. The West  The political, moral, economic and intellectual culture that  has been growing around the Enlightenment values of science, reason  and freedom. 32 the beginning of infinity meanings of ‘the beginning of infinity’  encountered in this chapter – The fact that some explanations have reach. – The universal reach of some explanations. – The Enlightenment. – A tradition of criticism. – Conjecture: the origin of all knowledge. – The discovery of how to make progress: science, the scientific   revo- lution, seeking good explanations, and the political principles of    the West. – Fallibilism. summary Appearances are deceptive. Yet we have a great deal of knowledge  about the vast and unfamiliar reality that causes them, and of the  elegant, universal laws that govern that reality. This knowledge consists  of explanations: assertions about what is out there beyond the appear- ances, and how it behaves. For most of the history of our species, we  had almost no success in creating such knowledge. Where does it come  from? Empiricism said that we derive it from sensory experience. This  is false. The real source of our theories is conjecture, and the real source  of our knowledge is conjecture alternating with criticism. We create  theories by rearranging, combining, altering and adding to existing  ideas with the intention of improving upon them. The role of experiment  and observation is to choose between existing theories, not to be the  source of new ones. We interpret experiences through explanatory  theories, but true explanations are not obvious. Fallibilism entails not  looking to authorities but instead acknowledging that we may always  be mistaken, and trying to correct errors. We do so by seeking good  explanations – explanations that are hard to vary in the sense that  changing the details would ruin the explanation. This, not experimental  testing, was the decisive factor in the scientific revolution, and also    in the unique, rapid, sustained progress in other fields that have partici- pated in the Enlightenment. That was a rebellion against authority  which, unlike most such rebellions, tried not to seek authoritative  33 The Reach of Explanations justifications for theories, but instead set up a tradition of criticism.  Some of the resulting ideas have enormous reach: they explain more  than what they were originally designed to. The reach of an explanation  is an intrinsic attribute of it, not an assumption that we make about it  as empiricism and inductivism claim. Now I’ll say some more about appearance and reality, explanation  and infinity. 34 2 Closer to Reality A galaxy is a mind-bogglingly huge thing. For that matter, a star is a  mind-bogglingly huge thing. Our own planet is. A human brain is – in======================================================== information: one cannot send a message to  the other universe; nor can one change anything in one’s own universe  sooner than light could reach that thing. Nor can one bring new  information – even random information – into the world: everything  that happens is determined by laws of physics from what has gone  before. However, one can, of course, bring new  knowledge  into the  world. Knowledge consists of explanations, and none of those conditions  prevents the creation of new explanations. All this is true of the real  world too. We can temporarily think of the two universes as being literally  parallel. Suppress the third dimension of space and think of a universe  264 the beginning of infinity as being two-dimensional, like an infinitely flat television. Then place  a second such television parallel to it, showing exactly the same pictures  (symbolizing the objects in the two universes). Now forget the material  of which the televisions are made. Only the pictures exist. This is to  stress that a universe is not a receptacle containing physical objects: it  is  those objects. In real physics, even space is a physical object, capable  of warping and affecting matter and being affected by it. So now we have two perfectly parallel, identical universes, each  including an instance of our starship, its crew and its transporter, and  of the whole of space. Because of the symmetry between them, it is  now misleading to call one of them ‘the ordinary universe’ and the  other ‘the phantom zone’. So I shall just call them ‘universes’. The two  of them together (which comprise the whole of physical reality in the  story so far) are the  multiverse . Similarly, it is misleading to speak of  the ‘original’ object and its ‘ doppelgänger ’: they are simply the two  instances  of the object. If our science-fiction speculation were to stop there, the two universes  would have to remain identical for ever. There is nothing logically  impossible about that. Yet it would make our story fatally flawed both  as fiction and as scientific speculation – and for the same reason: it is  a story of two universes, but only one  history . That is to say, there is  only one script about what is really there in both universes. Considered  as fiction, therefore, it is really a single-universe story in a pointless  disguise. Considered as scientific speculation, it describes a world that  would not be explicable to its inhabitants. For how could they ever  argue that their history takes place in two universes and not three or  thirty? Why not two today and thirty tomorrow? Moreover, since their  world has only one history, all their good explanations about nature  would be about that history. That single history would be what they  meant by their ‘world’ or ‘universe’. Nothing of the underlying two-ness  of their reality would be accessible to them, nor would it make any  more sense to them as an explanation than would three-ness or thirty- ness – yet they would be factually mistaken.  A remark about explanation: Although the story so far would be a  bad explanation from the inhabitants’ point of view, it is not necessarily  bad from ours. Imagining inexplicable worlds can help us to understand  the nature of explicability. I have already imagined some inexplicable  265 The Multiverse worlds for that very reason in previous chapters, and I shall imagine  more in this chapter. But, in the end, I want to tell of an explicable  world, and it will be ours. A remark about terminology: The  world  is the whole of physical  reality. In classical (pre-quantum) physics, the world was thought to  consist of one  universe  – something like a whole three-dimensional  space for the whole of time, and all its contents. According to quantum  physics, as I shall explain, the world is a much larger and more com  - plicated object, a  multiverse , which includes many such universes  (among other things). And a  history  is a sequence of events happening  to objects and possibly their identical counterparts. So, in my story so  far, the world is a multiverse that consists of two universes but has  only a single history.  So our two universes must not stay identical. Something like a  transporter malfunction will have to make them different. Yet, as I  said, that may seem to have been ruled out by those restrictions on  information flow. The laws of physics in the fictional multiverse are  deterministic and symmetrical. So what can the transporter possibly  do that would make the two universes differ? It may seem that whatever  one instance of it does to one universe, its  doppelgänger  must be doing  to the other, so the universes can only remain the same. Surprisingly, that is not so. It  is  consistent for two identical entities  to become different under deterministic and symmetrical laws. But, for  that to happen, they must initially be more than just exact images of  each other: they must be  fungible  (the  g  is pronounced as in ‘plunger’),  by======================================================== why that must be so, starting with the fallibility  of the human mind and the unreliability of sensory experience.  plato : [ Scribbles,   ‘It’s only knowledge  of the material world  that’s  impossible, useless and undesirable.’ ] socrates: He  gave me a marvellous perspective on how we perceive  the world. Each of your eyes is like a dark little cave, one on whose  rear wall some stray shadows fall from outside. You spend your  whole life at the back of that cave, able to see nothing but that rear  wall, so you cannot see reality directly at all.  plato : [ Scribbles,   ‘It is as if we were prisoners, chained inside a cave  and permitted to look only at the rear wall. We can never know the  253 A Dream of Socrates reality outside because we see only fleeting, distorted shadows of it.’ ] [Note: Socrates is slightly improving on Hermes, and Plato has  been increasingly misinterpreting Socrates.] socrates: He  then went on to explain to me that objective knowledge  is indeed possible: it comes from within! It begins as conjecture, and  is then  corrected  by repeated cycles of criticism, including comparison  with the evidence on our ‘wall’.  plato : [ Scribbles,   ‘The only true knowledge is that which comes from  within. (How? Remembered from a previous life?)’ ] socrates: In  this way, we frail and fallible humans can come to know  objective reality – provided we use philosophically sound methods  as I have described (which most people do not). plato : [ Scribbles,   ‘We can come to know the true world beyond the  illusory world of experience. But only by pursuing the kingly art of  philosophy.’ ] chaerephon:  Socrates, I think it  was  the god speaking to you, for I  strongly feel that I have glimpsed a divine truth through you today.  It will take me a long time to reorganize my ideas to take account  of this new epistemology that he revealed to you. It seems a  tremendously far-reaching, and important, subject. socrates:  Indeed. I have some reorganizing to do myself. plato : Socrates, you really ought to write all this down – together  with all your other wisdom – for the benefit of the whole world, and  posterity. socrates: No  need, Aristocles. Posterity is right here, listening.  Posterity is all of  you , my friends. What is the point of writing down  things that are going to be endlessly tinkered with and improved?  Rather than make a permanent record of all my misconceptions as  they are at a particular instant, I would rather offer them to others  in two-way debate. That way I benefit from criticism and may even  make improvements myself. Whatever is valuable will survive such  debates and be passed on without any effort from me. Whatever is  not valuable would only make me look a fool to future generations. plato : If you say so, Master. Since Socrates left us no writings, historians of ideas can only guess at  what he really thought and taught, using the indirect evidence of his  254 the beginning of infinity portrayal by Plato and a few others who were there at the time and  whose accounts have survived. This is known as the ‘Socratic problem’,  and is the source of much controversy. One common view is that the  young Plato conveyed Socrates’ philosophy fairly faithfully, but that  later he used the character of Socrates more as a vehicle for conveying  his own views; that he did not even intend his dialogues to represent  the real Socrates, but used them only as convenient ways of expressing  arguments that have a to-and-fro form.  Perhaps I had better stress – in case it is not already obvious – that  I am doing the same. I do not intend the above dialogue accurately to  represent the philosophical opinions of the historical Socrates and  Plato. I have set it at that moment in history, with those participants,  because Socrates and his circle were among the foremost contributors  to the ‘Golden Age of Athens’, which should have become a beginning  of infinity but did not. And also because one thing that we do know  about the ancient Greeks is that the philosophical  problems  they  considered important have dominated Western philosophy ever since:  How is knowledge obtained? How can we distinguish between true  and false, right and wrong, reason and unreason? Which sorts of  knowledge (moral, empirical, theological, mathematical, justified . . . )  are possible, and which are mere chimeras? And so on. And therefore,  although the theory of knowledge presented in the dialogue is largely  that of the twentieth-century philosopher Karl Popper, together with  some addenda of my own, I guess that Socrates would have understood  and liked it. In some universes that were very like ours at the time, he  thought of it himself. I do want to make one indirect comment on the Socratic problem,  though: we habitually underestimate the difficulty of communication  – just as Socrates does at the end of the dialogue, when he assumes  that each party to a debate necessarily knows what the other is saying,======================================================== information: one cannot send a message to  the other universe; nor can one change anything in one’s own universe  sooner than light could reach that thing. Nor can one bring new  information – even random information – into the world: everything  that happens is determined by laws of physics from what has gone  before.

Bronowski’s view was  closer to mine, which is that since the culture never improved, its  survival  for many centuries was a tragedy, like that of all static societies. Attenborough is not alone in drawing frightening lessons from the  history of Easter Island. It has become a widely adduced version of    the Spaceship Earth metaphor. But what exactly is the analogy behind  the lesson? The idea that civilization depends on good  forest  manage- ment has little reach. But the broader interpretation, that survival  depends on good  resource  management, has almost no content:  any   physical object can be deemed a ‘resource’. And, since problems are  soluble, all disasters are caused by ‘poor resource management’. The  ancient Roman ruler Julius Caesar was stabbed to death, so one could  sum    marize his mistake as ‘imprudent iron management, resulting in  an excessive build-up of iron in his body’. It is true that if he had  succeeded in keeping iron away from his body he would not have died  in the (exact) way he did, yet, as an explanation of how and why he  died, that ludicrously misses the point. The interesting question is not  what he was stabbed with, but how it came about that other politicians  plotted to remove him violently from office and that they succeeded.  A Popperian analysis would focus on the fact that Caesar had taken  vigorous steps to ensure that he could not be removed  without  violence.  And then on the fact that his removal did not rectify, but actually  entrenched, this progress-suppressing innovation. To under  stand such  events and their wider significance, one has to understand the politics  of the situation, the psychology, the philosophy, sometimes the theology.  Not the cutlery. The Easter Islanders may or may not have suffered a  forest-management fiasco. But, if they did, the ex      planation would not  be about why they made mistakes – problems are inevitable – but why  they failed to correct them. I have argued that the laws of nature cannot possibly impose any  bound on progress: by the argument of Chapters 1 and 3, denying this  is tantamount to invoking the supernatural. In other words, progress  is  sustainable , indefinitely. But only by people who engage in a particular  kind of thinking and behaviour – the problem-solving and problem- creating kind characteristic of the Enlightenment. And that requires  the optimism of a dynamic society. 424 the beginning of infinity One of the consequences of optimism is that one expects to learn  from failure – one’s own and others’. But the idea that our civilization  has something to learn from the Easter Islanders’ alleged forestry failure  is not derived from any structural resemblance between our situation  and theirs. For they failed to make progress in practically every area.  No one expects the Easter Islanders’ failures in, say, medicine to explain  our difficulties in curing cancer, or their failure to understand the night  sky to explain why a quantum theory of gravity is elusive to us. The  Easter Islanders’ errors, both methodological and substantive, were  simply too elementary to be relevant to us, and their imprudent forestry,  if that is really what destroyed their civilization, would merely be typical  of their lack of problem-solving ability across the board. We should  do much better to study their many small successes than their entirely  commonplace failures. If we could discover their rules of thumb (such  as ‘stone mulching’ to help grow crops on poor soil), we might find  valuable fragments of historical and ethnological knowledge, or    perhaps even something of practical use. But one cannot draw general  conclusions from rules of thumb. It would be astonishing if the details  of a primitive, static society’s collapse had any relevance to hidden  dangers that may be facing our open, dynamic and scientific society,  let alone what we should do about them.  The knowledge that would have saved the Easter Islanders’ civil- ization has already been in our possession for centuries. A sextant would  have allowed them to explore their ocean and bring back the seeds of  new forests and of new ideas. Greater wealth, and a written culture,  would have enabled them to recover after a devastating plague. But,  most of all, they would have been better at solving problems of all kinds  if they had known some of our ideas about how to do that, such as the  rudi  ments of a scientific outlook. Such knowledge would not have  guaranteed their welfare, any more than it guarantees ours. Nevertheless,  the fact that their civilization failed for lack of what ours discovered  long ago cannot be an ominous ‘warning of what the future could hold’  for us. This knowledge-based approach to explaining human events follows  from the general arguments of this book. We know that achieving  arbitrary physical transformations that are not======================================================== impact of the photon. And  that means that in only one-fifth of the universes in which the photon  struck has the wave of differentiation spread to the mirror, and only  298 the beginning of infinity in those will subsequent interference between instances of that photon  that have or have not hit the mirror be suppressed. With realistic numbers, that is more like one in a trillion trillion –  which means that there is only a probability of one in a trillion trillion  that interference will be suppressed. This is considerably lower than  the probability that the experiment will give inaccurate results due    to imperfect measuring instruments, or that it will be spoiled by a  lightning strike. Now let us look at the arrival of that single quantum of energy, to  see how that discrete change can possibly happen without any dis  - continuity. Consider the simplest possible case: an atom absorbs a  photon, including all its energy. This energy transfer does not take  place instantaneously. (Forget anything that you may have read about  ‘quantum jumps’: they are a myth.) There are many ways in which it  can happen but the simplest is this. At the beginning of the process,  the atom is in (say) its ‘ground state’, in which its electrons have the  least possible energy allowed by quantum theory. That means that all  its instances (within the relevant coarse-grained history) have that  energy. Assume that they are also fungible. At the end of the process,  all those instances are still fungible, but now they are in the ‘excited  state’, which has one additional quantum of energy. What is the atom  like halfway through the process?  Its instances are still fungible ,   but  now half of them are in the ground state and half in the excited state.  It is as if a continuously variable amount of money changed ownership  gradually from one discrete owner to another. This mechanism is ubiquitous in quantum physics, and is the general  means by which transitions between discrete states happen in a continu- ous way. In classical physics, a ‘tiny effect’ always means a tiny change  in some measurable quantities. In quantum physics, physical variables  are typically discrete and so cannot undergo tiny changes. Instead, a  ‘tiny effect’ means a tiny change in the  proportions  that have the  various discrete attributes.  This also raises the issue of whether time itself is a continuous  variable. In this discussion I am assuming that it is. However, the  quantum mechanics of time is not yet fully understood, and will not  be until we have a quantum theory of gravity (the unification of  quantum theory with the general theory of relativity), so it may turn  299 The Multiverse out that things are not as simple as that. One thing we can be fairly  sure of, though, is that, in that theory,  different times are a special  case of different universes.  In other words, time is an entanglement  phenomenon, which places all equal clock readings (of correctly  prepared clocks – or of any objects usable as clocks) into the same  history. This was first understood by the physicists Don Page and  William Wooters, in 1983. In this full version of the quantum multiverse, how is our science- fiction story to continue? Almost all the attention that the quantum  theory has attracted, from physicists, philosophers and science-fiction  authors alike, has focused on its parallel-universes aspect. That is ironic,  because it is in the parallel-universe approximation that the world most  resembles that of classical physics, yet that is the very aspect of quantum  theory that many people seem to find viscerally unacceptable. Fiction can explore the possibilities opened up by parallel universes.  For instance, since our story is a romance, the characters may well  wonder about their counterparts in other histories. The story could  compare their speculations with what we ‘know’ happened in the other  histories. The character whose spouse’s unfaithfulness was revealed by  a ‘random’ event might wonder whether that event provided a lucky  escape from what was a doomed marriage anyway. Are they still  married in the history in which the unfaithfulness was not subsequently  revealed? Are they still happy? Can it be true happiness if it is ‘based  on a lie’? As we see them speculating on these matters, we see the ‘still  married’ history and know the (fictional) fact of the matter. They might also speculate about less parochial issues. The story could  say that their sun is part of a cluster of dozens of stars, all within a  sphere of a few light-weeks’ radius. This has puzzled their scientists for  decades, since the composition of the stars shows that they originated  from far and wide and became gravitationally bound through a series  of very unlikely coincidences. In most universes, these scientists calcu-  late, life cannot evolve in such dense star clusters, because there are too  many collisions. So in most universes that contain humans there are no======================================================== for  many purposes. But artistic values are not subordinate to, or derived  from, anything else. The same critique applies to the theory that art is self-expression.  367 Why are Flowers Beautiful?  Expression  is conveying something that is already there, while objective  progress in art is about creating something new. Also,  self -expression  is about expressing something subjective, while pure art is objective.  For the same reason, any kind of art that consists solely of spontaneous  or mechanical acts, such as throwing paint on to canvas, or of pickling  sheep, lacks the means of making artistic progress, because real progress  is difficult and involves many errors for every success. If I am right, then the future of art is as mind-boggling as the future  of every other kind of knowledge: art of the future can create unlimited  increases in beauty. I can only speculate, but we can presumably expect  new kinds of unification too. When we understand better what elegance  really is, perhaps we shall find new and better ways to seek truth using  elegance or beauty. I guess that we shall also be able to design new  senses, and design new qualia, that can encompass beauty of new kinds  literally inconceivable to us now. ‘What is it like to be a bat?’ is a  famous question asked by the philosopher Thomas Nagel. (More  precisely, what would it be like for a person to have the echo-location  senses of a bat?) Perhaps the full answer is that in future it will be not  so much be the task of philosophy to discover what that is like, but  the task of technological art to give us the experience itself.  terminology Aesthetics  The philosophy of beauty.

The standard argument that  there cannot be is a relic of empiricism. Aesthetic truths are linked to  factual ones by explanations, and also because artistic problems can  emerge from physical facts and situations. The fact that flowers reliably  seem beautiful to humans when their designs evolved for an apparently  unrelated purpose is evidence that beauty is objective. Those convergent  criteria of beauty solve the problem of creating hard-to-forge signals  where prior shared knowledge is insufficient to provide them. 369 15 The Evolution of Culture Ideas that survive A  culture  is a set of ideas that cause their holders to behave alike in  some ways. By ‘ideas’ I mean any information that can be stored in  people’s brains and can affect their behaviour. Thus the shared values  of a nation, the ability to communicate in a particular language, the  shared knowledge of an academic discipline and the appreciation of  a given musical style are all, in this sense, ‘sets of ideas’ that define  cultures. Many of them are inexplicit; in fact all ideas have some  inexplicit component, since even our knowledge of the meanings of  words is held largely inexplicitly in our minds. Physical skills, such as  the ability to ride a bicycle, have an especially high inexplicit content,  as do philosophical concepts such as freedom and knowledge. The  distinction between explicit and inexplicit is not always sharp. For  instance, a poem or a satire may be explicitly about one subject, while  the audience in a particular culture will reliably, and without being  told, interpret it as being about a different one. The world’s major cultures – including nations, languages, philo- sophical and artistic movements, social traditions and religions – have  been created incrementally over hundreds or even thousands of years.  Most of the ideas that define them, including the inexplicit ones, have  a long history of being passed from one person to another. That makes  these ideas  memes  – ideas that are replicators. Nevertheless, cultures change. People modify cultural ideas in their  minds, and sometimes they pass on the modified versions. Inevitably,  there are unintentional modifications as well, partly because of straight- forward error, and partly because inexplicit ideas are hard to convey  accurately: there is no way to download them directly from one brain  370 the beginning of infinity to another like computer programs. Even native speakers of a language  will not give identical definitions of every word. So it can be only rarely,  if ever, that two people hold precisely the same cultural idea in their  minds. That is why, when the founder of a political or philosophical  movement or a religion dies, or even before, schisms typically happen.  The movement’s most devoted followers are often======================================================== would have been the last gasp of reason in the field. I doubt that either Lagrange or Michelson thought of himself as  pessimistic. Yet their prophecies entailed the dismal decree that  no  matter what you do, you will understand no further . It so happens that  both of them had made discoveries which could have led them to the  very progress whose possibility they denied. They should have been  seeking that progress, should they not? But almost no one is creative  in fields in which they are pessimistic. I remarked at the end of Chapter 13 that the desirable future is one  where we progress from misconception to ever better (less mistaken)  misconception. I have often thought that the nature of science would  be better understood if we called theories ‘misconceptions’ from the  outset, instead of only after we have discovered their successors. Thus  we could say that Einstein’s Misconception of Gravity was an improve- ment on Newton’s Misconception, which was an improvement on  Kepler’s. The neo-Darwinian Misconception of Evolution is an im    - provement on Darwin’s Misconception, and his on Lamarck’s. If people  thought of it like that, perhaps no one would need to be reminded that  science claims neither infallibility nor finality.  Perhaps a more practical way of stressing the same truth would be to  frame the growth of knowledge (all knowledge, not only scientific) as a  continual transition from  problems  to  better problems , rather than from  447 The Beginning problems to solutions or from theories to better theories .  This is the  positive conception of ‘problems’ that I stressed in Chapter 1. Thanks  to Einstein’s discoveries, our current problems in physics embody more  knowledge than Einstein’s own problems did. His prob  lems were rooted  in the discoveries of Newton and Euclid, while most problems that  preoccupy physicists today are rooted in – and would be inaccessible  mysteries without – the discoveries of twentieth-century physics.  The same is true in mathematics. Although mathematical theorems  are rarely proved  false  once they have been around for a while, what  does happen is that mathematicians’ understanding of what is fund- amental improves. Abstractions that were originally studied in their  own right are understood as aspects of more general abstractions, or  are related in unforeseen ways to other abstractions. And so progress  in mathematics also goes from problems to better problems, as does  progress in all other fields.  Optimism and reason are incompatible with the conceit that our  knowledge is ‘nearly there’ in any sense, or that its foundations are.  Yet comprehensive optimism has always been rare, and the lure of    the prophetic fallacy strong. But there have always been exceptions.  Socrates famously claimed to be deeply ignorant. And Popper wrote: I believe that it would be worth trying to learn something about the   world even if in trying to do so we should merely learn that we do not  know much . . . It might be well for all of us to remember that, while  differing widely in the various little bits we know, in our infinite ignorance  we are all equal. Conjectures and Refutations  (1963) Infinite ignorance is a necessary condition for there to be infinite  potential for knowledge. Rejecting the idea that we are ‘nearly there’  is a necessary condition for the avoidance of dogmatism, stagnation  and tyranny. In 1996 the journalist John Horgan caused something of a stir with  his book  The End of Science :  Facing the Limits of Knowledge in the  Twilight of the Scientific Age . In it, he argued that the final truth in all  fundamental areas of science – or at least as much of it as human minds  would ever be capable of grasping – had already been discovered during  the twentieth century. 448 the beginning of infinity Horgan wrote that he had originally believed science to be ‘open- ended, even infinite’. But he became convinced of the contrary by (what  I would call) a series of misconceptions and bad arguments. His basic  misconception was empiricism. He believed that what distinguishes  science from unscientific fields such as literary criticism, philosophy or  art is that science has the ability to ‘resolve questions’ objectively (by  comparing theories with reality), while other fields can produce only  multiple, mutually incompatible interpretations of any issue. He was  mistaken in both respects. As I have explained throughout this book,  there is objective truth to be found in all those fields, while finality or  infallibility cannot be found anywhere. Horgan accepts from the bad philosophy of ‘postmodern’ literary  criticism its wilful confusion between two kinds of ‘ambiguity’ that  can exist in philosophy and art. The first is the ‘ambiguity’ of multiple  true meanings, either intended by the author or existing because of the  reach of the ideas. The second is the ambiguity of deliberate vagueness,  confusion, equivocation or self-contradiction. The======================================================== which I mean identical in literally every way except that there are  two of them. The concept of fungibility is going to appear repeatedly  in my story. The term is borrowed from legal terminology, where it  refers to the legal fiction that  deems  certain entities to be identical for  purposes such as paying debts. For example, dollar bills are fungible  in law, which means that, unless otherwise agreed, borrowing a dollar  does not require one to return the specific banknote that one borrowed.  Barrels of oil (of a given grade) are fungible too. Horses are not:  borrowing someone’s horse means that one has to return that specific  horse; even its identical twin will not do. But the physical fungibility  I am referring to here is not about deeming. It means  being  identical,  and that is a very different and counter-intuitive property. Leibniz, in  266 the beginning of infinity his doctrine of ‘the identity of indiscernibles’, went so far as to rule  out its existence on principle. But he was mistaken. Even aside from  the physics of the multiverse, we now know that photons, and under  some conditions even atoms, can be fungible. This is achieved in lasers  and in devices called ‘atomic lasers’ respectively. The latter emit bursts  of extremely cold, fungible atoms. For how this is possible without  causing transmutation, explosions and so on, see below.  You will not find the concept of fungibility discussed or even  mentioned in many textbooks or research papers on quantum theory,  even the small minority that endorse the many-universes interpretation.  Nevertheless, it is everywhere just beneath the conceptual surface, and  I believe that making it explicit helps to explain quantum phenomena  without fudging. As will become clear, it is an even weirder attribute  than Leibniz guessed – much weirder than multiple universes for  instance, which are, after all, just common sense, repeated. It allows  radically new types of  motion  and  information flow , different from  anything that was imagined before quantum physics, and hence a  radically different structure of the physical world. It so happens that, in some situations, money is not only legally  fungible but physically too; and, being so familiar, it provides a good  model for thinking about fungibility. For example, if the balance in  your (electronic) bank account is one dollar, and the bank adds a second  dollar as a loyalty bonus and later withdraws a dollar in charges, there  is no meaning to whether the dollar they withdrew is the one that was  there originally or the one that they had added – or is composed of a  little of each. It is not merely that  we   cannot know  whether it was the  same dollar, or have decided not to care: because of the physics of the  situation there really is no such thing as taking the original dollar, nor  such a thing as taking the one added subsequently.  Dollars in bank accounts are what may be called ‘configurational’  entities: they are states or configurations of objects, not what we usually  think of as physical objects in their own right. Your bank balance  resides in the  state  of a certain information-storage device. In a sense  you own that state (it is illegal for anyone to alter it without your  consent), but you do not own the device itself or any part of it. So in  that sense a dollar is an abstraction. Indeed, it is a piece of  abstract  knowledge . As I discussed in Chapter 4, knowledge, once embodied  267 The Multiverse in physical form in a suitable environment, causes itself to remain so.  And thus, when a physical dollar wears out and is destroyed by the  mint, the abstract dollar causes the mint to transfer it into electronic  form, or into a new instance in paper form. It is an abstract replicator  – though, unusually for a replicator, it causes itself  not  to proliferate,  but rather to be copied into ledgers and into backups of computer  memories. Another example of fungible configurational entities in classical  physics is amounts of energy: if you pedal your bicycle until you have  built up a kinetic energy of ten kilojoules, and then brake until half  that energy has been dissipated as heat, there is no meaning to whether  the energy dissipated was the first five kilojoules that you had added  or the second, or any combination. But it is meaningful that  half  the  energy that was there has been dissipated. It turns out that, in quantum  physics, elementary particles are configurational entities too. The  vacuum, which we perceive as empty at everyday scales and even at  atomic scales, is not really emptiness, but a richly structured entity  known as a ‘quantum field’. Elementary particles are higher-energy  configurations of this entity: ‘excitations of the vacuum’. So, for in    - stance, the photons in a laser are configurations of the vacuum inside  its ‘cavity’. When two or more such excitations with identical attributes  (such as energy and spin) are present in the cavity, there======================================================== present and future – is as good as it could possibly be. The term  was first used to describe an argument of Leibniz (1646–1716) that  God, being ‘perfect’, would have created nothing less than ‘the best of  all possible worlds’. Leibniz believed that this idea solved the ‘problem  of evil’, which I mentioned in Chapter 4: he proposed that all apparent  evils in the world are outweighed by good consequences that are too  remote to be known. Similarly, all apparently good events that  fail  to  200 the beginning of infinity happen – including all improvements that humans are unsuccessful in  achieving – fail because they would have had bad consequences that  would have outweighed the good. Since consequences are determined by the laws of physics, the larger  part of Leibniz’s claim must be that the laws of physics are the best  possible too. Alternative laws that made scientific progress easier, or  made disease an impossible phenomenon, or made even one disease  slightly less unpleasant – in short, any alternative that would  seem   to be an improvement upon our actual history with all its plagues,  tortures, tyrannies and natural disasters – would in fact have been even  worse on balance, according to Leibniz. That theory is a spectacularly bad explanation. Not only can  any   observed sequence of events be explained as ‘best’ by that method, an  alternative Leibniz could equally well have claimed that we live in the  worst  of all possible worlds, and that every good event is necessary in  order to prevent something even better from happening. Indeed, some  philosophers, such as Arthur Schopenhauer, have claimed just that.  Their stance is called philosophical ‘pessimism’. Or one could claim  that the world is exactly halfway between the best possible and the  worst possible – and so on. Notice that, despite their superficial differ- ences, all those theories have something important in common: if any  of them were true, rational thought would have almost no power to  discover true explanations. For, since we can always imagine states of  affairs that seem better than what we observe, we would always be  mistaken that they  were  better,  no matter how good our explanations  were . So, in such a world, the true explanations of events are never  even imaginable. For instance, in Leibniz’s ‘optimistic’ world, whenever  we try to solve a problem and fail, it is because we have been thwarted  by an unimaginably vast intelligence that determined that it was best  for us to fail. And, still worse, whenever someone rejects reason and  decides instead to rely on bad explanations or logical fallacies – or, for  that matter, on pure malevolence – they still achieve, in every case, a  better outcome on balance than the most rational and benevolent  thought possibly could have. This does not describe an explicable  world. And that would be very bad news for us, its inhabitants. Both  the original ‘optimism’ and the original ‘pessimism’ are close to pure  pessimism as I shall define it. 201 Optimism In everyday usage, a common saying is that ‘an optimist calls a glass  half full while a pessimist calls it half empty’. But those attitudes are  not what I am referring to either: they are matters not of philosophy  but of psychology – more ‘spin’ than substance. The terms can also  refer to moods, such as cheerfulness or depression, but, again, moods  do not necessitate any particular stance about the future: the statesman  Winston Churchill suffered from intense depression, yet his outlook  on the future of civilization, and his specific expectations as wartime  leader, were unusually positive. Conversely the economist Thomas  Malthus, a notorious prophet of doom (of whom more below), is said  to have been a serene and happy fellow, who often had his companions  at the dinner table in gales of laughter.  Blind  optimism  is  a stance towards the future. It consists of proceed- ing as if one knows that the bad outcomes will not happen. The  opposite approach, blind pessimism, often called the  precautionary  principle , seeks to ward off disaster by avoiding everything not known  to be safe. No one seriously advocates either of these two as a universal  policy, but their assumptions and their arguments are common, and  often creep into people’s planning. Blind optimism is also known as ‘overconfidence’ or ‘recklessness’.  An often cited example, perhaps unfairly, is the judgement of the builders  of the ocean liner  Titanic  that it was ‘practically unsinkable’. The largest  ship of its day, it sank on its maiden voyage in 1912. Designed to survive  every foreseeable disaster, it collided with an iceberg in a manner that  had not been foreseen. A blind pessimist argues that there is an inherent  asymmetry between good and bad consequences: a successful maiden  voyage cannot possibly do as much good as a disastrous one can do  harm. As Rees points out, a single catastrophic consequence of an  otherwise beneficial======================================================== genes, are not stored  in identical physical forms in every holder. But, as I shall explain, that  does not necessarily make it impossible for memes to be transmitted  ‘faithfully’ in the sense that matters for evolution. It is indeed meaning- ful to think of memes as retaining their identity as they pass from one  holder to the next. Just as genes often work together in groups to achieve what we might  think of as a single adaptation, so there are memeplexes consisting of  several ideas which can, alternatively, be thought of as a single more  complex idea, such as quantum theory or neo-Darwinism. So it does  not matter if we refer to a memeplex as a meme, just as it does not  matter if we refer to quantum theory as a single theory or a group of  theories. However, ideas, including memes, cannot be indefinitely  analysed into sub-memes, because there comes a point where replacing  a meme by part of itself would result in its not being copied. So, for  instance, ‘2 + 3 = 5’ is not a meme, because it does not have what it takes  to cause itself reliably to be copied, except under circumstances which  would also copy some theory of arithmetic with universal reach, which  itself could not be transmitted without also transmitting the knowledge  that 2 + 3 = 5. Laughing at a joke and retelling it are both behaviours caused by  the joke, but we often do not know why we are enacting them. That  reason is objectively there in the meme, but we do not know it. We  may try to guess, but our guess will not necessarily be true. For instance,  we may guess that the humour in a particular joke lay in the un    - expectedness of its punchline. But further experience with the same  joke may reveal that it remains funny when we hear it again. In such  a case, we are in the counter-intuitive (but common) position of having  been  mistaken about the reason for our own behaviour .  The same sort of thing happens with rules of grammar. We say, ‘I am  learning to play  the  piano’ (in British English), but never ‘I am learning  to play  the  baseball.’ We know how to form such sentences correctly,  but, until we think about it, very few of us know that the inexplicit  375 The Evolution of Culture grammatical rule we are following even exists, let alone what it is. In  American English the rule is slightly different, so the phrase ‘learning  to play piano’ is acceptable. We may wonder why, and guess that the  British are more fond of the definite article. But, again, that is not the  explanation: in British English a patient is ‘in hospital’, and in American  English ‘in  the  hospital’. The same is true of memes in general: they implicitly contain infor- mation that is not known to the holders, but which nevertheless causes  the holders to behave alike. Hence, just as native English speakers may  be mistaken about why they have said ‘the’ in a given sentence, people  enacting all sorts of other memes often give false explanations, even  to themselves, of why they are behaving in that way.  Like genes, all memes contain knowledge (often inexplicit) of how  to cause their own replication. This knowledge is encoded in strands  of DNA or remembered by brains respectively. In both cases, the  knowledge is  adapted  to causing itself to be replicated: it causes  that more reliably than nearly all its variants do. In both cases, this  adaptation is the outcome of alternating rounds of variation and  selection. However, the logic of the copying mechanism is very different for  genes and memes. In organisms that reproduce by dividing, either all  the genes are copied into the next generation or (if the individual fails  to reproduce) none are. In sexual reproduction, a full complement of  genes randomly chosen from both parents is copied, or none are. In  all cases, the DNA duplication process is automatic: genes are copied  indiscriminately. One consequence is that some genes can be replicated  for many generations without ever being ‘expressed’ (causing any  behaviour) at all. Whether your parents ever broke a bone or not, genes  for repairing broken bones will (barring unlikely mutations) be passed  on to you and your descendants. The situation faced by memes is utterly different. Each meme has to  be expressed as behaviour every time it is replicated. For it is that  behaviour, and only that behaviour (given the environment created by  all the other memes), that effects the replication. That is because a  recipient cannot see the representation of the meme in the holder’s  mind. A meme cannot be downloaded like a computer program. If it  is not enacted, it will not be copied. 376 the beginning of infinity The upshot of this is that memes necessarily become embodied in  two different physical forms alternately: as memories in a brain, and  as behaviour: A meme exists in a brain form and a behaviour form, and each is copied    to the other. Each  of the two forms has to be copied (specifically, translated into  the other form) in each======================================================== parties manage to do this, but the most common outcome is  that the leader of the third-largest party holds the ‘balance of power’  and decides which of the two largest parties shall join it in government,  and which shall be sidelined, and for how long. That means that it is  correspondingly harder for the  electorate  to decide which party, and  which policies, will be removed from power. In Germany (formerly West Germany) between 1949 and 1998, the  Free Democratic Party (FDP) was the third largest.* Though it never  received more than 12.8 per cent of the vote, and usually much less, the  country’s proportional-representation system gave it power that was  *I am counting the Christian Democrat CDU and the regionally based CSU as being  one party for present purposes. 340 the beginning of infinity insensitive to changes in the voters’ opinions. On several occasions it  chose which of the two largest parties would govern, twice changing  sides and three times choosing to put the less popular of the two (as  measured by votes) into power. The FDP’s leader was usually made a  cabinet minister as part of the coalition deal, with the result that for    the last twenty-nine years of that period Germany had only two weeks  without an FDP foreign minister. In 1998, when the FDP was pushed  into fourth place by the Green Party, it was immediately ousted from  government, and the Greens assumed the mantle of kingmakers. And  they took charge of the Foreign Ministry as well. This disproportionate  power that proportional representation gives the third-largest party    is an embarrassing feature of a system whose whole  raison d’être ,  and supposed moral justification, is to allocate political influence  proportionately. Arrow’s theorem applies not only to collective decision-making but  also to individuals, as follows. Consider a single, rational person faced  with a choice between several options. If the decision requires thought,  then each option must be associated with an explanation – at least a  tentative one – for why it might be the best. To choose an option is to  choose its explanation. So how does one decide which explanation to  adopt? Common sense says that one ‘weighs’ them – or weighs the evidence  that their arguments present. This is an ancient metaphor. Statues of  Justice have carried scales since antiquity. More recently, inductivism  has cast scientific thinking in the same mould, saying that scientific  theories are chosen, justified and believed – and somehow even formed  in the first place – according to the ‘weight of evidence’ in their favour.  Consider that supposed weighing process. Each piece of evidence,  including each feeling, prejudice, value, axiom, argument and so on,  depending on what ‘weight’ it had in that person’s mind, would  contribute that amount to that person’s ‘preferences’ between various  explanations. Hence for the purposes of Arrow’s theorem each piece  of evidence can be regarded as an ‘individual’ participating in the  decision-making process, where the person as a whole would be the  ‘group’.  Now, the process that adjudicates between the different explanations  would have to satisfy certain constraints if it were to be rational. For  341 Choices instance, if, having decided that one option was the best, the person  received further evidence that gave additional weight to that option,  then the person’s overall preference would still have to be for that  option – and so on. Arrow’s theorem says that those requirements are  inconsistent with each other, and so seems to imply that all decision- making – all thinking – must be irrational. Unless, perhaps, one of the  internal agents is a dictator, empowered to override the combined  opinions of all the other agents. But this is an infinite regress: how does  the ‘dictator’ itself choose between rival explanations about which  other agents it would be best to override?  There is something very wrong with that entire conventional model  of decision-making, both within single minds and for groups as as    - sumed in social-choice theory. It conceives of decision-making as a  process of selecting from existing options according to a fixed formula  (such as an apportionment rule or electoral system). But in fact that is  what happens only at the  end  of decision-making – the phase that does  not require creative thought. In terms of Edison’s metaphor, the model  refers only to the perspiration phase, without realizing that decision- making is problem-solving, and that without the inspiration phase  nothing is ever solved and there is nothing to choose between. At    the heart of decision-making is the creation of new options and the  abandonment or modification of existing ones. To choose an option, rationally, is to choose the associated ex    - planation. Therefore, rational decision-making consists not of weighing  evidence but of explaining it, in the course of explaining the world. One  judges arguments as======================================================== such projects is that,  after they achieve their intended aim, if the ‘evolutionary’ program is  allowed to run further it produces no further improvements. This is  exactly what would happen if all the knowledge in the successful robot  had actually come from the programmer, but it is not a conclusive  critique: biological evolution often reaches ‘local maxima of fitness’.  Also, after attaining its mysterious form of universality, it seemed    to pause for about a billion years before creating any significant    new knowledge. But still, achieving results that might well be due to  something else is not evidence of evolution.  That is why I doubt that any ‘artificial evolution’ has ever created  knowledge. I have the same view, for the same reasons, about the slightly  different kind of ‘artificial evolution’ that tries to evolve simulated  organisms in a virtual environment, and the kind that pits different  virtual species against each other.  To test this proposition, I would like to see an experiment of a slightly  different kind: eliminate the graduate student from the project. Then,  162 the beginning of infinity instead of using a robot designed to evolve better ways of walking, use  a robot that is already in use in some real-life application and happens  to be capable of walking. And then, instead of creating a special  language of subroutines in which to express conjectures about how to  walk, just replace its existing program, in its existing microprocessor,  by  random numbers . For mutations, use errors of the type that happen  anyway in such processors (though in the simulation you are allowed  to make them happen as often as you like). The purpose of all that is  to eliminate the possibility that human knowledge is being fed into the  design of the system, and that its reach is being mistaken for the product  of evolution. Then, run simulations of that mutating system in the  usual way. As many as you like. If the robot ever walks better than it  did originally, then I am mistaken. If it continues to improve after that,  then I am very much mistaken. One of the main features of the above experiment, which is lacking  in the usual way of doing artificial evolution, is that, for it to work,  the  language  (of subroutines) would have to evolve along with the  adaptations that it was expressing. This is what was happening in the  biosphere before that jump to universality that finally settled on the  DNA genetic code. As I said, it may be that all those previous genetic  codes were only capable of coding for a small number of organisms  that were all rather similar. And that the overwhelmingly rich biosphere  that we see around us, created by randomly varying genes while  leaving the language unchanged, is something that became possible  only after that jump. We do not even know what kind of universality  was created there. So why should we expect our artificial evolution  to work without it?  I think we have to face the fact, both with artificial evolution and  with AI, that these are hard problems. There are serious unknowns in  how those phenomena were achieved in nature. Trying to achieve them  artificially without ever discovering those unknowns was perhaps  worth trying. But it should be no surprise that it has failed. Specifically,  we do not know why the DNA code, which evolved to describe  bacteria, has enough reach to describe dinosaurs and humans. And,  although it seems obvious that an AI will have qualia and conscious- ness, we cannot explain those things. So long as we cannot explain  them, how can we expect to simulate them in a computer program?  163 Artificial Creativity Or why should they emerge effortlessly from projects designed to  achieve something else? But my guess is that when we do understand  them, artificially implementing evolution and intelligence and its con  - stel    lation of associated attributes will then be no great effort. terminology Quale  (plural  qualia )  The subjective aspect of a sensation. Behaviourism   Instrumentalism applied to psychology. The doctrine  that science can (or should) only measure and predict people’s  behaviour in response to stimuli. summary The field of artificial (general) intelligence has made no progress because  there is an unsolved philosophical problem at its heart: we do not  understand how creativity works. Once that has been solved, program- ming it will not be difficult. Even artificial evolution may not have been  achieved yet, despite appearances. There the problem is that we do not  understand the nature of the universality of the DNA replication  system. 164 8 A Window on Infinity Mathematicians realized centuries ago that it is possible to work  consistently and usefully with infinity. Infinite sets, infinitely large  quantities and also infinitesimal quantities all make sense. Many of  their properties are counter-intuitive, and the introduction of theories  about infinities has always been controversial; but======================================================== beautiful, more wonderful place than  a universe tricked out with capricious ad hoc magic.  Unweaving the Rainbow  (1998) An ‘orderly’ (explicable) universe is indeed more beautiful (see Chapter  14) – though the assumption that to be orderly it has to be ‘indifferent  to human preoccupations’ is a misconception associated with the  Principle of Mediocrity.  Any assumption that the world is  in explicable can lead only to  54 the beginning of infinity extremely bad explanations. For an inexplicable world is indistinguish- able from one ‘tricked out with capricious ad hoc magic’: by definition,  no hypothesis about the world outside the bubble of explicability can  be a better explanation than that Zeus rules there – or practically any  myth or fantasy one likes.  Moreover, since the outside of the bubble affects our explanations  of the inside (or else we may as well do without it), the inside is not  really explicable either. It seems so only if we carefully refrain from  asking certain questions. This bears an uncanny resemblance to the  intellectual landscape before the Enlightenment, with its distinction  between Earth and heaven. It is a paradox inherent in the Principle of  Mediocrity: contrary to its motivation, here it is forcing us back to an  archaic, anthropocentric, pre-scientific conception of the world. At root, the Principle of Mediocrity and the Spaceship Earth metaphor  overlap in a claim about  reach : they both claim that the reach of the  distinctively human way of being – that is to say, the way of problem- solving, knowledge-creating and adapting the world around us – is  bounded. And they argue that its bounds cannot be very far beyond  what it has already reached. Trying to go beyond that range must lead  to failure and catastrophe respectively. Both ideas also rely on essentially the same argument, namely that  if there were no such limit, there would be no explanation for the  continued effectiveness of the adaptations of the human brain beyond  the conditions under which they evolved. Why should one adaptation  out of the trillions that have ever existed on Earth have unlimited reach,  when all others reach only inside the tiny, insignificant, untypical  biosphere? Fair enough: all reach has an explanation. But what if there  is  an explanation, and what if it has nothing to do with evolution or  the biosphere? Imagine that a flock of birds from a species that evolved on one  island happens to fly to another. Their wings and eyes still work. That  is an example of the reach of those adaptations. It has an explanation,  the essence of which is that wings and eyes exploit universal laws of  physics (of aerodynamics and optics respectively). They exploit those  laws only imperfectly; but the atmospheric and lighting conditions on  the two islands are sufficiently similar, by the criteria defined by those  laws, for the same adaptations to work on both. 55 The Spark Thus the birds may well be able to fly to an island many kilometres  away horizontally, but if they were transported only a few kilometres  upwards their wings would stop working because the density of the  air would be too low. Their implicit knowledge about how to fly fails  at high altitude. A little further up, their eyes and other organs would  stop working. The design of these too does not have that much reach:  all vertebrate eyes are filled with liquid water, but water freezes at  stratospheric temperatures and boils in the vacuum of space. Less  dramatically, the birds might also die if they merely had no good night  vision and they reached an island where the only suitable prey organisms  were nocturnal. For the same reason, biological adaptations also have  limited reach in regard to changes in their  home  environment – which  can and do cause extinctions.  If those birds’ adaptations do have enough reach to make the species  viable on the new island, they will set up a colony there. In subsequent  generations, mutants slightly better adapted to the new island will end  up having slightly more offspring on average, so evolution will adapt  the population more accurately to contain the knowledge needed to  make a living there. The ancestor species of humans colonized new  habitats and embarked on new lifestyles in exactly that way. But by  the time our species had evolved, our fully human ancestors were  achieving much the same thing thousands of times faster, by evolving  their cultural knowledge instead. Because they did not yet know how  to do science, their knowledge was only a little less parochial than  biological knowledge. It consisted of rules of thumb. And so progress,  though rapid compared to biological evolution, was sluggish compared  to what the Enlightenment has accustomed us to. Since the Enlightenment, technological progress has depended  specifically on the creation of explanatory knowledge. People had  dreamed for millennia of flying to the moon, but it was only with the  advent of Newton’s======================================================== phenomena remote from our  everyday experience, the longer those chains of interpretation become,  and every additional link necessitates more theory. A single unexpected  39 Closer to Reality or misunderstood phenomenon anywhere in the chain can, and often  does, render the resulting sensory experience arbitrarily misleading.  Yet, over time, the conclusions that science has drawn have become  ever truer to reality. Its quest for good explanations corrects the errors,  allows for the biases and misleading perspectives, and fills in the gaps.  This is what we can achieve when, as Feynman said, we keep learning  more about how not to fool ourselves. Telescopes contain automatic tracking mechanisms that continuously  realign them so as to compensate for the effect of the Earth’s motion;  in some, computers continuously change the shape of the mirror so as  to compensate for the shimmering of the Earth’s atmosphere. And so,  observed through such a telescope, stars do not appear to twinkle or  to move across the sky as they did to generations of observers in the  past. Those things are only appearance – parochial error. They have  nothing to do with the reality of stars. The primary function of the  telescope’s optics is to reduce the illusion that the stars are few, faint,  twinkling and moving. The same is true of every feature of the telescope,  and of all other scientific instruments: each layer of indirectness,  through its associated theory, corrects errors, illusions, misleading  perspectives and gaps. Perhaps it is the mistaken empiricist ideal of  ‘pure’, theory-free observation that makes it seem odd that truly  accurate observation is always so hugely indirect. But the fact is that  progress requires the application of ever more knowledge  in advance   of our observations. So I was indeed looking at galaxies. Observing a galaxy via specks  of silver is no different in that regard from observing a garden via  images on a retina. In all cases, to say that we have genuinely observed  any given thing is to say that we have accurately attributed our evidence  (ultimately always evidence inside our own brains) to that thing.  Scientific truth consists of such correspondence between theories and  physical reality.  Scientists operating giant particle accelerators likewise look at pixels  and ink, numbers and graphs, and thereby observe the microscopic  reality of subatomic particles like nuclei and quarks. Others operate  electron microscopes and fire the beam at cells that are as dead as  dodos, having been stained, quick-frozen by liquid nitrogen, and  mounted in a vacuum – but they thereby learn what  living  cells are  40 the beginning of infinity like. It is a marvellous fact that objects can exist which, when we  observe them, accurately take on the appearance and other attributes  of other objects that are elsewhere and very differently constituted.  Our sensory systems are such objects too, for it is only they that are  directly affecting our brains when we perceive anything. Such instruments are rare and fragile configurations of matter.    Press one wrong button on the telescope’s control panel, or code one  wrong instruction into its computer, and the whole immensely complex  artefact may well revert to revealing nothing other than itself. The same  would be true if, instead of making that scientific instrument, you were  to assemble those raw materials into almost any other configuration:  stare at them, and you would see nothing other than them. Explanatory theories tell us how to build and operate instruments  in exactly the right way to work this miracle. Like conjuring tricks in  reverse, such instruments fool our senses into seeing what is really  there. Our minds, through the methodological criterion that I mentioned  in Chapter 1, conclude that a particular thing is real if and only if it  figures in our best explanation of something. Physically, all that has  happened is that human beings, on Earth, have dug up raw materials  such as iron ore and sand, and have rearranged them – still on Earth  – into complex objects such as radio telescopes, computers and display  screens, and now, instead of looking at the sky, they look at those  objects. They are focusing their  eyes  on human artefacts that are close  enough to touch. But their  minds  are focused on alien entities and  processes, light years away.  Sometimes they are still looking at glowing dots just as their ancestors  did – but on computer monitors instead of the sky. Sometimes they  are looking at numbers or graphs. But in all cases they are inspecting  local phenomena: pixels on a screen, ink on paper, and so on. These  things are physically very unlike stars: they are much smaller; they are  not dominated by nuclear forces and gravity; they are not capable of  transmuting elements or creating life; they have not been there for  billions of years. But when astronomers look at them, they see stars. 41 Closer to Reality summary======================================================== eponymous part of the world. The  mathematician and philosopher Nicholas de Condorcet, for instance,  was French yet belonged more to what I am calling the ‘British’  Enlightenment, while Karl Popper, the twentieth century’s foremost  proponent of the British Enlightenment, was born in Austria.  The Continental Enlightenment was impatient for the perfected state  – which led to intellectual dogmatism, political violence and new forms  of tyranny. The French Revolution of 1789 and the Reign of Terror  that followed it are the archetypal examples. The British Enlightenment,  which was evolutionary and cognizant of human fallibility, was im    - patient for institutions that did not stifle gradual, continuing change.  It was also enthusiastic for small improvements, unbounded in the  future. (See, for instance, the historian Jenny Uglow’s book  Lunar  Men .) This is, I believe, the movement that was successful in its pursuit  of progress, so in this book when I refer to ‘the’ Enlightenment I mean  the ‘British’ one.  To investigate the ultimate reach of humans (or of people, or of  progress), we should not be considering places like the Earth and the  moon, which are unusually rich in resources. Let us go back to that  typical place. While the Earth is inundated with matter, energy and  evidence, out there in intergalactic space all three are at their lowest  possible supply. There is no rich supply of minerals, no vast nuclear  reactor overhead delivering free energy, no lights in the sky or diverse  local events to provide evidence of the laws of nature. It is empty, cold  and dark.  Or is it? Actually, that is yet another parochial misconception.  Intergalactic space is indeed very empty by human standards. But each  of those solar-system-sized cubes still contains over a billion tonnes of  matter – mostly in the form of ionized hydrogen. A billion tonnes is  more than enough mass to build, say, a space station and a colony of  67 The Spark scientists creating an open-ended stream of knowledge –  if  anyone were  present who knew how to do that.  No human today knows how. For instance, one would first have to  transmute some of the hydrogen into other elements. Collecting it from  such a diffuse source would be far beyond us at present. And, although  some types of transmutation are already routine in the nuclear industry,  we do not know how to transmute hydrogen into other elements on  an industrial scale. Even a simple nuclear-fusion reactor is currently  beyond our technology. But physicists are confident that it is not  forbidden by any laws of physics, in which case, as always, it can only  be a matter of knowing how. No doubt a billion-tonne space station is not large enough to thrive  in the very long run. The inhabitants will want to enlarge it. But that  presents no problem of principle. As soon as they started to trawl their  cube for hydrogen, more would drift in from the surrounding space,  supplying the cube with millions of tonnes of hydrogen per year. (There  is also believed to be an even greater mass of ‘dark matter’ in the cube,  but we do not know how to do anything useful with it, so let us ignore  it in this thought experiment.) As for the cold, and the lack of available energy – as I said, the  transmutation of hydrogen releases the energy of nuclear fusion. That  would be a sizeable power supply, orders of magnitude more than the  combined power consumption of everyone on Earth today. So the cube  is not as lacking in resources as a parochial first glance would suggest.  How would the space station get its vital supply of evidence? Using  the elements created by transmutation, one could construct scientific  laboratories, as in the projected moon base. On Earth, when chemistry  was in its infancy, making discoveries often depended on travelling all  over the planet to find materials to experiment on. But transmutation  makes that irrelevant; and chemical laboratories on the space station  would be able to synthesize arbitrary compounds of arbitrary elements.  The same is true of elementary particle physics: in that field, almost  anything will do as a source of evidence, because every atom is poten- tially a cornucopia of particles just waiting to display themselves if one  hits the atom hard enough (using a particle accelerator) and observes  with the right instruments. In biology, DNA and all other biochemical  molecules could be synthesized and experimented on. And, although  68 the beginning of infinity biology field trips would be difficult (because the closest natural eco  - system would be millions of light years away), arbitrary life forms  could be created and studied in artificial ecosystems, or in virtual-reality  simulations of them. As for astronomy – the sky there is pitch black  to the human eye, but to an observer with a telescope, even one of  present-day design, it would be packed with galaxies. A somewhat  bigger telescope could see stars in those galaxies in======================================================== celebrates Persephone’s revenge and the  anniversary of her escape by commanding plants to grow and adorn  the Earth. This myth accounts for the same observations as the original,  and it is testable (and in fact refuted) by the same observations. Yet  what it asserts about reality is markedly different from – in many ways  it is the opposite of – the original myth. Every other detail of the story, apart from its bare prediction that  winter happens once a year, is just as easily variable. So, although the  myth was created to explain the seasons, it is only superficially adapted  to that purpose. When its author was wondering what could possibly  make a goddess do something once a year, he did not shout, ‘Eureka!  It must have been a marriage contract enforced by a magic seed.’ He  made that choice – and all his substantive choices as author – for  cultural and artistic reasons, and not because of the attributes of winter  at all. He may also have been trying to explain aspects of human nature  metaphorically – but here I am concerned with the myth only in its  capacity as an explanation  of seasons , and in that respect even its  21 The Reach of Explanations author could not have denied that the role of all the details could be  played equally well by countless other things. The Persephone and Freyr myths assert radically incompatible things  about what is happening in reality to cause seasons. Yet no one, I guess,  has ever adopted either myth as a result of comparing it on its merits  with the other, because there is no way of distinguishing between them.  If we ignore all the parts of both myths whose role could be easily  replaced, we are left with the same core explanation in both cases:  the  gods did it . Although Freyr is a very different god of spring from  Persephone, and his battles very different events from her conjugal  visits, none of those differing attributes has any function in the myths’  respective accounts of why seasons happen. Hence none of them  provides any reason for choosing one explanation over the other. The reason those myths are so easily variable is that their details are  barely connected to the details of the phenomena. Nothing in the  problem of why winter happens is addressed by postulating specifically  a marriage contract or a magic seed, or the gods Persephone, Hades  and Demeter – or Freyr. Whenever a wide range of variant theories can  account equally well for the phenomenon they are trying to explain,  there is no reason to prefer one of them over the others, so advocating  a particular one in preference to the others is irrational.  That freedom to make drastic changes in those mythical explanations  of seasons is the fundamental flaw in them. It is the reason that myth- making in general is not an effective way to understand the world. And  that is so whether the myths are testable or not, for whenever it is easy  to vary an explanation without changing its predictions, one could just  as easily vary it to make different predictions if they were needed. For  example, if the ancient Greeks  had  discovered that the seasons in the  northern and southern hemispheres are out of phase, they would have  had a choice of countless slight variants of the myth that would be  consistent with that observation. One would be that when Demeter is  sad she banishes warmth  from her vicinity , and it has to go elsewhere  – into the southern hemisphere. Similarly, slight variants of the Perse- phone explanation could account just as well for seasons that were  marked by green rainbows, or seasons that happened once a week, or  sporadically, or not at all. Likewise for the superstitious gambler or  the end-of-the-world prophet: when their theory is refuted by experience,  22 the beginning of infinity they do indeed switch to a new one; but, because their underlying  explanations are bad, they can easily accommodate the new experience  without changing the substance of the explanation. Without a good  explanatory theory, they can simply reinterpret the omens, pick a new  date, and make essentially the same prediction. In such cases, testing  one’s theory and abandoning it when it is refuted constitutes no  progress towards understanding the world. If an explanation could  easily explain anything in the given field, then it actually explains  nothing. In general, when theories are easily variable in the sense I have  described, experimental testing is almost useless for correcting their  errors. I call such theories  bad explanations.  Being proved wrong by  experiment, and changing the theories to other bad explanations, does  not get their holders one jot closer to the truth.  Because explanation plays this central role in science, and because  testability is of little use in the case of bad explanations, I myself prefer  to call myths, superstitions and similar theories  un scientific even when  they make testable predictions. But it does not matter what terminology  you use, so======================================================== unpredictable jolts during others forms of travel such as flying  or bronco-riding. Let us imagine that a tiny surge is produced in one  of the universes whenever the transporter is operated in both, but that  it is too small to be noticeable unless measured with a sensitive  voltmeter, or unless it nudges something that happens to be on the  brink of changing but would recede from the brink if not nudged.  In principle, a phenomenon could appear unpredictable to observers  for one or more of three reasons. The first is that it is affected by some  fundament  ally random (indeterministic) variable. I have excluded that  possibility from our story because there are no such variables in real  physics. The second, which is at least partly responsible for most  everyday un      predictability, is that the factors affecting the phenomenon,  *Identical entities that were at different locations  in an otherwise empty space  would  not be fungible, but some philosophers have argued that they would be ‘indiscernible’  in Leibniz’s sense. If so, then this is yet another respect in which fungibility is worse  than Leibniz imagined. 270 the beginning of infinity though deterministic, are either unknown or too complex to take  account of. (This is especially so when they involve the creation of  knowledge, as I discussed in Chapter 9.) The third – which had never  been imagined before quantum theory – is that two or more initially  fungible instances of the observer become different. That is what those  transporter-induced jolts bring about, and it makes their outcomes  strictly un      predictable despite being described by deterministic laws of  physics.  These remarks about unpredictable phenomena could be expressed  without ever referring explicitly to fungibility. And indeed that is what  multiverse researchers usually do. Nevertheless, as I have said, I believe  that fungibility is essential to the explanation of quantum randomness  and most other quantum phenomena. All three of these radically different causes of unpredictability could  in principle feel exactly the same to observers. But, in an explicable  world, there must be a way of finding out which of them (or which  combination of them) is the actual source of any apparent randomness  in nature. How could one find out that it is fungibility and parallel  universes that are responsible for a given phenomenon?  In fiction, there is always the temptation to introduce inter-universe  communication for this purpose, making the universes no longer  ‘parallel’. As I have said, that would really make it a single-universe  story – but we might try to disguise that fact by saying that such  communication is  difficult . For example, it might be that there is a way  of adjusting the transporter in either universe so that it produces a  voltage surge in the other. Then one could use it to transmit a message  there. But we could imagine that this is very expensive, or dangerous,  so that the ship’s regulations limit its use. ‘Personal communication’  with one’s own  doppelgänger  is especially prohibited. Nevertheless,  one crew member illicitly ignores this prohibition during the night  watch, and is startled to receive a message ‘have  married sonak.’  We know, but the character does not, that this marriage is a knock-on  effect of the coffee-spilling incident which was itself a knock-on effect  of the voltage surge in the other universe. Then the transmission ends  and no more such messages are received. We know – but again the  character does not – that this is because the illicit use of the equipment  has been detected in the other universe and stricter safeguards have  271 The Multiverse been implemented. The story could then explore what might happen  when the crew member acts upon that startling message.  How  should  one react to the news that one’s  doppelgänger  has  married? Should one seek out the spouse’s  doppelgänger  in one’s own  universe – whom one has never even met personally, let alone formed  a romantic relationship with? Or whom, in the time-honoured tradition  of love stories, one finds annoying. It can’t do any harm. Or can it?  Ideas originating in the other universe are at least as fallible as those  in ours; and if they are difficult to obtain, that makes error-correction  harder. Knowledge-creation depends on error-correction. So perhaps  the message would have continued ‘ already regretting it’. Or  perhaps Sonak had just turned up in the transporter room in the other  universe, making it impossible to send that warning. Or perhaps the  couple are happy at the moment, but will shortly have a disastrous  break-up resulting in divorce. In all those cases, that inter-universe  communication, far from being helpful, could cause a doubling of the  number of disastrous marriage decisions made by the two instances of  that crew member. More generally, the news that your  doppelgänger  seems happy having  made a particular decision in the other======================================================== so the only constraint on the  imaginary laws of physics is that they be consistent. It is  because  of  the requirement that they be consistent that they are counter-intuitive:  intuitions about infinity are often illogical. It is a bit awkward to have to keep changing rooms – though they  are all identical and are freshly made up every time a guest moves in.  But guests love staying at Infinity Hotel. That is because it is cheap –  only a dollar a night – yet extraordinarily luxurious. How is that  possible? Every day, when the management receive all the room rents  of one dollar per room, they spend the income as follows. With the  dollars they received from the rooms numbered 1 to 1000, they buy  complimentary champagne, strawberries, housekeeping services and  all the other overheads,  just for room 1 . With the dollars they received  from the rooms numbered 1001 to 2000, they do the same for room  2, and so on. In this way, each room receives several hundred dollars’  worth of goods and services every day, and the management make a  profit as well, all from their income of one dollar per room. Word gets around, and one day an infinitely long train pulls up at  the local station, containing infinitely many people wanting to stay at  the hotel. Making infinitely many public-address announcements would  take too long (and, anyway, the hotel rules say that each guest can be  asked to perform only a finite number of actions per day), but no  matter. The management merely announce, ‘Will all guests please move  immediately to the room whose number is double that of their current  room.’ Obviously they can all do that, and afterwards the only occupied  rooms are the even numbered ones, leaving the odd-numbered ones  free for the new arrivals. That is exactly enough to receive the infinitely  many new guests, because there are exactly as many odd numbers as  there are natural numbers, as illustrated overleaf: 170 the beginning of infinity There are exactly as many odd numbers as there are natural numbers. So the first new arrival goes to room 1, the second to room 3, and so  on. Then, one day, an  infinite number  of infinitely long trains arrive at  the station, all full of guests for the hotel. But the managers are still  unperturbed. They just make a slightly more complicated announce- ment, which readers who are familiar with mathematical terminology  can see in this footnote.* The upshot is: everyone is accommodated. However, it  is  mathematically possible to overwhelm the capacity  of Infinity Hotel. In a remarkable series of discoveries in the 1870s,  Cantor proved, among other things, that not all infinities are equal. In  particular, the infinity of the continuum – the number of points in a  finite line (which is the same as the number of points in the whole of  space or spacetime) – is much larger than the infinity of the natural  numbers. Cantor proved this by proving that there can be no one-to- one correspondence between the natural numbers and the points in a  line: that set of points has a higher order of infinity than the set of  natural numbers. Here is a version of his proof – known as the  diagonal argument.  Imagine a one-centimetre-thick pack of cards, each one so thin that  there is one of them for every ‘real number’ of centimetres between 0  and 1. Real numbers can be defined as the decimal numbers between  those limits, such as 0.7071. . ., where the ellipsis again denotes a  continuation that may be infinitely long. It is impossible to deal out  *First, they announce to the existing guests, ‘For each natural number  N , will the guest  in room number  N  please move immediately to room number  N ( N  +   1)/2.’ Then they  announce, ‘For all natural numbers  N  and  M , will the  N th passenger from the  M th  train please go to room number [( N  +  M ) 2   +  N  –  M ]/2.’ 171 A Window on Infinity one of these cards to each room of Infinity Hotel. For suppose that the  cards  were  so distributed. We can prove that this entails a contradiction.  It would mean that cards had been assigned to rooms in something  like the manner of the table below. (The particular numbers illustrated  are not significant: we are going to prove that real numbers cannot be  assigned in  any  order.) Cantor’s diagonal argument Look at the infinite sequence of digits highlighted in bold – namely  ‘  . . .’. Then consider a decimal number constructed as follows: it  starts with zero followed by a decimal point, and continues arbitrarily,  except that each of its digits must differ from the corresponding digit  in the infinite sequence ‘  . . .’. For instance, we could choose a  number such as ‘0.5885. . .’. The card with the number thus constructed  cannot have been assigned to any room. For it differs in its first digit  from that of the card assigned to room 1, and in its second digit from  that of the card assigned to room 2, and so on. Thus it differs from all  the cards that have been assigned======================================================== for? If we did not know better, the natural answer would be that they  were using it as we do today, for innovation and for understanding    the world, in order to improve their lives. For instance, individuals  who could improve stone tools would have ended up with better tools,  400 the beginning of infinity and hence with better food and more surviving offspring. They would  also have been able to make better weapons, thus denying the holders  of rival genes access to food and mates – and so on. Yet if that had  happened, the palaeontological record would show those improvements  happening on a timescale of generations. But it does not. Moreover, during the period when creativity was evolving, the ability  to replicate memes was evolving too. It is believed that some members  of the species  Homo erectus  living 500,000 years ago knew how to  make camp fires. That knowledge was in their memes, not in their  genes. And, once creativity and meme transmission are both present,  they greatly enhance each other’s evolutionary value, for then anyone  who improves something also has the means to bequeath the innovation  to all future generations, thus multiplying the benefit to the relevant  genes. And memes can be improved much faster by creativity than by  random trial and error. Since there is no upper limit to the value of  ideas, the conditions would have been there for a runaway co-evolution  between the two adaptations: creativity and the ability to use memes. Yet, again, there is something wrong with that scenario. The two  adaptations presumably did co-evolve, but the driving force behind  that evolution cannot have been that people were improving on ideas  and passing the improvements on to their children, because, again, if  they had been, they would have been making cumulative improvements  on a timescale of generations. Before the beginning of agriculture, about  12,000 years ago, many thousands of years passed between noticeable  changes. It is as though each small genetic improvement in creativity  produced just one noticeable innovation and then nothing more – rather  like today’s experiments in ‘artificial evolution’. But how can that be?  Unlike present-day artificial-evolution and AI research, our ancestors  were evolving  real  creativity, which is the capacity to create an endless  stream of innovations.  Their ability to innovate was increasing rapidly, but they were barely  innovating. This is a puzzle not because it is odd behaviour, but because,  if innovation was that rare, how could there have been a differential  effect on the reproduction of individuals with more or less ability to  innovate? That there were thousands of years between noticeable  changes presumably means that in most generations even the most  creative individuals in the population would not have been making  401 The Evolution of Creativity any innovations. Hence their greater ability to innovate would have  caused no selection pressure in their favour. Why did tiny improvements  in that ability keep spreading rapidly through the population? Our  ancestors must have been using their creativity – and using it to its  limits, and frequently – for  something . But evidently not for innovation.  What else could it have been used for? One theory is that it did not evolve to provide any functional  advantage, but merely through sexual selection: people used it to create  displays to attract mates – colourful clothing, decorations, story-telling,  wit and the like. A preference to mate with the individuals with the  most creative displays co-evolved with the creativity to meet that  preference in an evolutionary spiral – so the theory goes – just like  peahens’ preferences and peacocks’ tails. But creativity is an unlikely target for sexual selection. It is a sophis- ticated adaptation which, to this day, we are unable to reproduce  artificially. So it is presumably much harder to evolve than attributes  like coloration or the size and shape of body parts – some of which,  it is thought, did indeed evolve by sexual selection in humans and many  other animals. Creativity, as far as we know, evolved only once. More- over, its most visible effects are cumulative: it would be hard to detect  small differences in the creativity of potential mates on any one oc    - casion, especially if that creativity was not being used for practical  purposes. (Consider how hard it would be, today, to detect tiny  genetic   differences in people’s artistic abilities by means of an art competition.  In practice, any such differences would be swamped by other factors.)  So why did we not evolve multi-coloured hair or fingernails instead of  the capacity to create new knowledge, or any one of countless other  attributes that would have been far easier to evolve, and far easier to  assess reliably?  A more plausible variant of the sexual-selection theory is that people  chose mates according to social status, rather than favouring creativity======================================================== sufficient detail to  test most of our present-day theories of astrophysics and cosmology.  Even aside from those billion tonnes of matter, the cube is not empty.  It is full of faint light, and the amount of evidence in that light is  staggering: enough to construct a map of every star, planet and moon  in all the nearest galaxies to a resolution of about ten kilometres. To  extract that evidence in full, the telescope would need to use something  like a mirror of the same width as the cube itself, which would require  at least as much matter as building a planet. But even that would not  be beyond the bounds of possibility, given the level of technology    we are considering. To gather that much matter, those intergalactic  scientists would merely have to trawl out to a distance of a few  thousand cube-widths – still a piffling distance by intergalactic stand- ards. But even with a mere million-tonne telescope they could do a lot  of astronomy. The fact that planets with tilted axes have annual seasons  would be plain to see. They could detect life if it was present on any  of the planets, via the composition of its atmosphere. With more subtle  measurements they could test theories about the nature and history of  life – or intelligence – on the planet. At any instant, a typical cube  contains evidence, at that level of detail, about more than a trillion  stars and their planets, simultaneously. And that is only one instant. Additional evidence of all those kinds  is pouring into the cube all the time, so astronomers there could track  changes in the sky just as we do. And visible light is only one band of  the electromagnetic spectrum. The cube is receiving evidence in every  other band too – gamma rays, X-rays, all the way down to the micro- wave background radiation and radio waves, as well as a few cosmic- ray particles. In short, nearly all the channels by which we on Earth  currently receive evidence about any of the fundamental sciences are  available in intergalactic space too. And they carry much the same content: not only is the universe full  69 The Spark of evidence, it is full of the same evidence everywhere. All people in  the universe, once they have understood enough to free themselves  from parochial obstacles, face essentially the same opportunities.This  is an underlying unity in the physical world more significant than all  the dissimilarities I have described between our environment and a  typical one: the fundamental laws of nature are so uniform, and  evidence about them so ubiquitous, and the connections between  understanding and control so intimate, that, whether we are on our  parochial home planet or a hundred million light years away in the  intergalactic plasma, we can do the same science and make the same  progress. So a typical location in the universe is amenable to the open-ended  creation of knowledge. And therefore so are almost all other kinds of  environment, since they have more matter, more energy and easier  access to evidence than intergalactic space. The thought experiment  considered almost the worst possible case. Perhaps the laws of physics  do not allow knowledge-creation inside, say, the jet of a quasar. Or  perhaps they do. But either way, in the universe at large, knowledge- friendliness is the rule, not the exception. That is to say, the rule is  person-friendliness  to people who have the relevant knowledge . Death  is the rule for those who do not. These are the same rules that prevailed  in the Great Rift Valley from whence we came, and have prevailed    ever since. Oddly enough, that quixotic space station in our thought experiment  is none other than the ‘generation ship’ in the Spaceship Earth metaphor  – except that we have removed the unrealistic assumption that the  inhabitants never improve it. Hence presumably they have long since  solved the problem of how to avoid dying, and so ‘generations’ are no  longer essential to the way their ship works. In any case, with hindsight,  a generation ship was a poor choice for dramatizing the claim that the  human condition is fragile and dependent on support from an unaltered  biosphere, for that claim is contradicted by the very possibility of such  a spaceship. If it is possible to live indefinitely in a spaceship in space,  then it would be much more possible to use the same technology to  live on the surface of the Earth – and to make continuing progress  which would make it ever easier. It would make little practical difference  whether the biosphere had been ruined or not. Whether or not it could  70 the beginning of infinity support any other species, it could certainly accommodate people –  including humans – if they had the right knowledge.  Now I can turn to the significance of knowledge – and therefore of  people – in the cosmic scheme of things.  Many things are more  obviously  significant than people. Space and  time are significant because they appear in almost all explanations of  other======================================================== as   Μ .  If only they had allowed that rule to generate multi-tier numerals, so  that  M  would mean twenty-four myriad myriad, the system would have  been universal. But apparently they never did. Even more surprisingly,  nor did Archimedes. His system used a different idea, similar to modern  ‘scientific notation’ (in which, say, two million is written 2  ×  10 6 ), except  that instead of powers of ten it used powers of a myriad myriad. But,  again, he then required the exponent (the power to which the myriad  myriad was raised) to be an existing Greek numeral – that is to say, it  could not easily exceed a myriad myriad or so. Hence this construction  petered out after the number that we call 10 800,000,000 . If only he had  not imposed that additional rule, he would have had a universal system,  albeit an unnecessarily awkward one. Even today, only mathematicians ever need numbers above 10 800,000,000 ,  and only rarely at that. But that cannot be why Archimedes imposed  the restriction, for he did not stop there. Exploring the concept of  numbers further, he set up yet another extension, this time amounting  to an even more unwieldy system with base 10 800,000,000 . Yet, once again,  he allowed this number to be raised only to powers not exceeding  800,000,000, thus imposing an arbitrary limit somewhere in excess  of 10 6.4  ×  10 17 .  Why? Today it seems very perverse of Archimedes to have placed  limits on which symbols could be used at which positions in his  numerals. There is no mathematical justification for them. But, if  Archimedes had been willing to allow his rules to be applied without  arbitrary limits, he could have invented a much better universal system  just by removing the arbitrary limits from the existing Greek system.  A few years later the mathematician Apollonius invented yet another  κδ κδ Μ 133 The Jump to Universality system of numerals which fell short of universality for the same reason.  It is as though everyone in the ancient world was avoiding universality  on purpose. The mathematician Pierre Simon Laplace (1749–1827) wrote, of the  Indian system, ‘We shall appreciate the grandeur of this achievement  when we remember that it escaped the genius of Archimedes and  Apollonius, two of the greatest minds produced by antiquity.’ But was  this really something that escaped them, or something that they chose  to steer clear of? Archimedes must have been aware that his method  of extending a number system – which he used twice in succession –  could be continued indefinitely. But perhaps he doubted that the result- ing numerals would refer to anything about which one could validly  reason. Indeed, one motivation for that whole project was to contradict  the idea – which was a truism at the time – that the grains of sand on  a beach could literally not be numbered. So he used his system to  calculate the number of grains of sand that would be needed to fill the  entire celestial sphere. This suggests that he, and ancient Greek culture  in general, may not have had the concept of an abstract number at all,  so that, for them, numerals could refer only to objects – if only objects  of the imagination. In that case universality would have been a difficult  property to grasp, let alone to aspire to. Or maybe he merely felt that  he had to avoid aspiring to infinite reach in order to make a convincing  case. At any rate, although from our perspective Archimedes’ system  repeatedly ‘tried’ to jump to universality, he apparently did not want  it to.  Here is an even more speculative possibility. The largest benefits of  any universality, beyond whatever parochial problem it is intended to  solve, come from its being useful for further innovation. And innovation  is unpredictable. So, to appreciate universality at the time of its dis  - covery, one must either value abstract knowledge for its own sake or  expect it to yield unforeseeable benefits. In a society that rarely ex    - perienced change, both those attitudes would be quite unnatural. But  that was reversed with the Enlightenment, whose quintessential idea  is, as I have said, that  progress  is both desirable and attainable. And  so, therefore, is universality.  Be that as it may, with the Enlightenment, parochialism and all  arbitrary exceptions and limitations began to be regarded as inherently  134 the beginning of infinity problematic – and not only in science. Why should the law treat an  aristocrat differently from a commoner? A slave from a master? A  woman from a man? Enlightenment philosophers such as Locke set  out to free political institutions from arbitrary rules and assumptions.  Others tried to derive moral maxims from universal moral explanations  rather than merely to postulate them dogmatically. Thus universal  explanatory theories of justice, legitimacy and morality began to take  their place alongside universal theories of matter and motion. In all  those cases, universality was being sought deliberately,======================================================== thought to be achieved in part by  a system based on ‘mirror neurons’. These are neurons that fire when  an animal performs a given action, and also when the animal perceives  the same action being performed by another. These neurons have been  406 the beginning of infinity identified experimentally in animals that have the capacity to imitate.  Scientists who believe that human meme replication is a sophisticated  form of imitation tend to believe that mirror neurons are a key to  understanding all sorts of functions of the human mind. Unfortunately,  that cannot possibly be so. It is not known  why  parroting evolved. It is a fairly common adap- tation in birds, and may play more than one role. But, whatever the  reason, the important thing for present purposes is that parrots never  have a choice about which sounds to imitate, or about what constitutes  imitating them. A ringing doorbell and a barking dog may happen    to provide conditions that meet the inborn criterion that initiates  parroting behaviour, and, when they do, the parrot will always mimic  exactly the same aspects of them: their sounds. So, it resolves the infinite  ambiguity by making no choices. It does not occur to it to ignore the  dog under those conditions, or to imitate the wagging of its tail, because  it is incapable of conceiving of any other criterion for imitation than  the one built into its mirror-neuron system. It is devoid of creativity  and  relies  on its lack of creativity to replicate the sounds faithfully.  This is reminiscent of humans in static societies – except for a crucial  difference which I shall explain below. Now, imagine that a parrot had been present at Popper’s lectures,  and learned to parrot some of Popper’s favourite sentences. It would,  in a sense, have ‘imitated’ some of Popper’s ideas: in principle, an  interested student could later learn the ideas by listening to the parrot.  But the parrot would merely be transmitting those memes from one  place to another – which is no more than the air in the lecture theatre  does. The parrot could not be said to have acquired the memes, because  it would be reproducing only one of the countless behaviours that they  could produce. The parrot’s subsequent behaviour as a result of having  learned the sounds by heart – such as its responses to questions – would  not resemble Popper’s. The sound of the meme would be there, but its  meaning would not. And it is the meaning – the knowledge – that is  the replicator. The parrot is oblivious to the human meanings of the sounds that  it parrots. Had those lectures been not about philosophy but about  recipes for fried parrot, it would have been just as eager to quote from  them to anyone who would listen. But it is not  oblivious  to the content  407 The Evolution of Creativity of the sound – it is not like a mechanical recorder. Quite the contrary:  parrots neither record sounds indiscriminately nor replay them ran  - domly. Their inborn criteria do implicitly attribute meaning to sounds  that they hear; it is just that the meaning is always drawn from the  same, narrow set of possibilities: if the evolutionary function of par  - roting is, for instance, to create identifying calls, then every sound it  hears is either a potential identifying call or not. Apes are capable of recognizing a much larger set of possible  meanings. Some of them are so complex that aping has often been  misinterpreted as evidence of human-like understanding. For example,  when an ape learns a new method of cracking nuts by hitting them  with rocks, it does not then play the movements back blindly in a fixed  sequence like a parrot does. The movements required to crack the nut  are never the same twice: the ape has to  aim  the rock at the nut; it may  have to  chase  the nut and fetch it back if it rolls away; it has to keep  hitting it until it cracks, rather than a fixed number of times; and so  on. During some parts of the procedure the ape’s two hands must  cooperate, each performing a different sub-task. Before it can even  begin, it must be able to recognize a nut as being suitable for the  procedure; it must look for a rock and, again, recognize a suitable one.  Such activities may seem to depend on explanation – on understand-  ing how and why each action within the complex behaviour has to fit  in with the other actions in order to achieve the overall purpose. But  recent discoveries have revealed how apes are able to imitate such  behaviours without ever creating any explanatory knowledge. In a  remarkable series of observational and theoretical studies, the evo  - lutionary psychologist and animal-behaviour researcher Richard Byrne  has shown how they achieve this by a process that he calls  behaviour  parsing  (which is analogous to the grammatical analysis or ‘parsing’  of human speech or computer programs).  Humans and computers separate continuous streams of sounds or  characters into individual elements such as words, and======================================================== society replicate as reliably as the  most successful memes of either a very static society or an (as yet  hypothetical) fully dynamic society. This causes a number of phenomena  that are peculiar to our transitional era. One of them is that some anti-rational memes evolve against the  grain, towards rationality. An example is the transition from an auto- cratic monarchy to a ‘constitutional monarchy’, which has played a  positive role in some democratic systems. Given the instability that I  have described, it is not surprising that such transitions often fail. Another is the formation within the dynamic society of anti-rational  subcultures. Recall that anti-rational memes suppress criticism selectively  and cause only finely tuned damage. This makes it possible for the  members of an anti-rational subculture to function normally in other  respects. So such subcultures can survive for a long time, until they are  destabilized by the haphazard effects of reach from other fields. For  example, racism and other forms of bigotry exist nowadays almost  entirely in subcultures that suppress criticism. Bigotry exists not because  it benefits the bigots, but despite the harm they do to themselves by  using fixed, non-functional criteria to determine their choices in life.  Present-day methods of education still have a lot in common with  their static-society predecessors. Despite modern talk of encouraging  critical thinking, it remains the case that teaching by rote and inculcating  standard patterns of behaviour through psychological pressure are  integral parts of education, even though they are now wholly or partly  renounced in explicit theory. Moreover, in regard to academic know- ledge, it is still taken for granted, in practice, that the main purpose of  education is to transmit a standard curriculum faithfully. One con  - sequence is that people are acquiring scientific knowledge in an anaemic  and instrumental way. Without a critical, discriminating approach to  what they are learning, most of them are not effectively replicating the  memes of science and reason into their minds. And so we live in a  society in which people can spend their days conscientiously using  laser technology to count cells in blood samples, and their evenings    sitting cross-legged and chanting to draw supernatural energy out of  the Earth. 394 the beginning of infinity Living with memes Existing accounts of memes have neglected the all-important distinction  between the rational and anti-rational modes of replication. Con  - sequently they end up missing most of what is happening, and why.  Moreover, since the most obvious examples of memes are long-lived  anti-rational memes and short-lived arbitrary fads, the tenor of such  accounts is usually anti-meme, even when these accounts formally  accept that the best and most valuable knowledge also consists    of memes.  For example, the psychologist Susan Blackmore, in her book  The  Meme Machine , attempts to provide a fundamental explanation of the  human condition in terms of meme evolution. Now, memes are indeed  integral to the explanation for the existence of our species – though, as  I shall explain in the next chapter, I believe that the specific mechanism  she proposes would not have been possible. But, crucially, Blackmore  downplays the element of creativity both in the replication of memes  and in their origin. This leads her, for example, to doubt that techno- logical progress is best explained as being due to individuals as the  conventional narrative would have it. She regards it instead as meme  evolution. She cites the historian George Basalla, whose book  The  Evolution of Technology  denies ‘the myth of the heroic inventor’. But that distinction between ‘evolution’ and ‘heroic inventors’ as  being the agents of discovery makes sense only in a static society. There,  most change is indeed brought about in the way that I guessed jokes  might evolve, with no great creativity being exercised by any individual  participant. But in a dynamic society, scientific and technological  innovations are generally made creatively. That is to say, they emerge  from individual minds as novel ideas, having acquired significant  adaptations inside those minds. Of course, in both cases, ideas are built  from previous ideas by a process of variation and selection, which  constitutes evolution. But when evolution takes place largely within  an individual mind, it is not meme evolution. It is creativity by a heroic  inventor.  Worse, in regard to progress, Blackmore denies that there has been  ‘progress towards anything in particular’ – that is to say, no progress  towards anything objectively better. She recognizes only increasing  395 The Evolution of Culture complexity. Why? Because  biological  evolution does not have a ‘better’  or ‘worse’. This despite her own warning that memes and genes evolve  differently. Again, her claim is largely true of static societies, but not  of======================================================== if the experimenters tried to eliminate  the subjective self-assessment and instead observed happy and unhappy  behaviour  (such as facial expressions, or how often a person whistles  317 A Physicist’s History of Bad Philosophy a happy tune). The connection with happiness would still involve  comparing subjective interpretations which there is no way of calibrat- ing to a common standard; but in addition there would be an extra  level of interpretation: some people believe that behaving in ‘happy’  ways is a remedy for unhappiness, so, for those people, such behaviours  might be a proxy for  un happiness.  For these reasons, no behavioural study can detect whether happiness  is inborn or not. Science simply cannot resolve that issue until we    have explanatory theories about what objective attributes people are  referring to when they speak of their happiness, and also about what  physical chain of events connects genes to those attributes. So how does explanation-free science address the issue? First, one  explains that one is not measuring happiness directly, but only a proxy  such as the behaviour of marking checkboxes on a scale called ‘hap  - piness’. All scientific measurements use chains of proxies. But, as I  explained in Chapters 2 and 3, each link in the chain is an additional  source of error, and we can avoid fooling ourselves only by criticizing  the theory of each link – which is impossible unless an explanatory  theory links the proxies to the quantities of interest. That is why, in  genuine science, one can claim to have measured a quantity only when  one has an explanatory theory of how and why the measurement  procedure should reveal its value, and with what accuracy.  There are circumstances under which there  is  a good explanation  linking the measurable proxy such as marking checkboxes with a  quantity of interest, and in such cases there need be nothing unscientific  about the study. For example, political opinion surveys may ask whether  respondents are ‘happy’ with a given politician facing re-election, under  the theory that this gives information about which checkbox the  respondents will choose in the election itself. That theory is then tested  at the election. There is no analogue of such a test in the case of  happiness: there is no independent way of measuring it. Another  example of bona-fide science would be a clinical trial to test a drug  purported to alleviate (particular identifiable types of) unhappiness. In  that case, the objective of the study is, again, to determine whether the  drug causes  behaviour  such as saying that one is happier (without also  experiencing adverse side effects). If a drug passes that test, the issue of  whether it really makes the patients happier, or merely alters their  318 the beginning of infinity personality to have lower standards or something of that sort, is in    - accessible to science until such time as there is a testable explanatory  theory of what happiness is In explanationless science, one may acknowledge that actual happi- ness and the proxy one is measuring are not necessarily equal .  But one  nevertheless calls the proxy ‘happiness’ and moves on. One chooses a  large number of people, ostensibly at random (though in real life    one is restricted to small minorities such as university students, in a  particular country, seeking additional income), and one excludes those  who have detectable extrinsic reasons for happiness or unhappiness  (such as recent lottery wins or bereavement). So one’s subjects are just  ‘typical people’ – though in fact one cannot tell whether they are  statistically representative without an explanatory theory. Next, one  defines the ‘heritability’ of a trait as its degree of statistical correlation  with how genetically related the people are .  Again, that is a non- explanatory definition: according to it, whether one was a slave or not  was once a highly ‘heritable’ trait in America: it ran in families. More  generally, one acknowledges that statistical correlations do not imply  anything about what causes what. But one adds the inductivist   equivo-  cation that ‘they can be suggestive, though.’  Then one does the study and finds that ‘happiness’ is, say, 50 per cent  ‘heritable’. This asserts nothing about happiness itself, until the relevant  explanatory theories are discovered (at some time in the future – perhaps  after consciousness is understood and AIs are commonplace technology).  Yet people find the result interesting, because they interpret it via  everyday meanings of the words ‘happiness’ and ‘heritable’. Under that  interpretation – which the authors of the study, if they are scrupulous,  will nowhere have endorsed – the result is a profound contribution to  a wide class of philosophical and scientific debates about the nature of  the human mind. Press reports of the discovery will reflect this. The  headline will say, ‘New Study Shows Happiness 50% Genetically  Determined’ –======================================================== structure. We do not discover new facts or new effects by copying them,  or by inferring them inductively from observation, or by any other  method of instruction by the environment. We use, rather, the method  412 the beginning of infinity of trial and the elimination of error. As Ernst Gombrich says, ‘making  comes before matching’: the active production of a new trial structure  comes before its exposure to eliminating tests. The Myth of the Framework Popper could just as well have written, ‘We do not  acquire new memes   by copying them, or by inferring them inductively from observation,  or by any other method of imitation of, or instruction by, the environ- ment.’ The transmission of human-type memes – memes whose meaning  is not mostly predefined within the receiver – cannot be other than a  creative activity on the part of the receiver. Memes, like scientific theories, are not derived from anything. They  are created afresh by the recipient. They are conjectural explanations,  which are then subjected to criticism and testing before being tentatively  adopted. This same pattern of creative conjecture, criticism and testing generates  inexplicit as well as explicit ideas. In fact all creativity does, for no    idea can be represented entirely explicitly. When we make an explicit  conjecture, it has an inexplicit component whether we are aware of it  or not. And so does all criticism. Thus, as has so often happened in the history of universality, the human  capacity for universal explanation did not evolve to have a universal  function. It evolved simply to increase the volume of memetic information  that our ancestors could acquire, and the speed and accuracy which they  could acquire it. But since the easiest way for evolution to do that was  to give us a universal ability to explain, through creativity, that is what  it did. This epistemological fact provides not only the solution of the  two puzzles I mentioned, but also the reason for the evolution of human  creativity – and therefore the human species – in the first place.  It must have happened something like this. In early pre-human  societies, there were only very simple memes – the kind that apes now  have, though perhaps with a wider repertoire of copiable elementary  behaviours. Those memes were about practical things like how to get  food that was otherwise inaccessible. The value of such knowledge  must have been high, so this created a ready-made niche for any  adaptation that would reduce the effort required to replicate memes.  Creativity was the ultimate adaptation to fill that niche. As it increased,  413 The Evolution of Creativity further adaptations co-evolved, such as an increase in memory capacity  (to store more memes), finer motor control, and specialized brain  structures for dealing with language. As a result, the meme band-  width (the amount of memetic information that could be passed from    each generation to the next) increased too. Memes also became more  complex and sophisticated. This is why and how our species evolved, and why it evolved rapidly  – at first. Memes gradually came to dominate our ancestors’ behaviour.  Meme evolution took place, and, like all evolution, this was always in  the direction of greater faithfulness. This meant becoming ever more  anti-rational. At some point, meme evolution achieved static societies  – presumably they were tribes. Consequently, all those increases in  creativity never produced streams of innovations. Innovation remained  imperceptibly slow, even as the capacity for it was increasing rapidly. Even in a static society, memes still evolve, due to imperceptible  errors of replication. They just evolve more slowly than anyone can  notice: imperceptible errors cannot be suppressed. They would generally  evolve towards greater fidelity of replication, as usual with evolution,  and hence to greater staticity of the society. Status in such a society is reduced by transgressing people’s ex    - pectations of proper behaviour, and is improved by meeting them.  There would have been the expectations of parents, priests, chiefs and  potential mates (or whoever controlled mating in that society) – who  were themselves conforming to the wishes and expectations of the  society at large. Those people’s opinions would determine one’s ability  to eat, thrive and reproduce, and hence the fate of one’s genes. But how does one discover the wishes and expectations of other  people? They might issue commands, but they could never specify every  detail of what they expected, let alone every detail of how to achieve  it. When one is commanded to do something (or expected to, as a  condition for being considered worthy of food or mating, for instance),  one might remember seeing an already-respected person doing the  same thing, and one might try to emulate that person. To do that  effectively, one would have to understand what the point of doing it  was, and to try to achieve  that  as best one======================================================== contrary,  it wiped them out because they  were  living the lifestyles that they  had evolved to live, and in which, according to the Spaceship Earth  metaphor, the biosphere had been ‘supporting’ them.  Yet that still overstates the degree to which the biosphere is hospitable  to humans in particular. The first people to live at the latitude of Oxford  (who were actually from a species related to us, possibly the Neanderthals)  50 the beginning of infinity could do so only because they brought knowledge with them, about  such things as tools, weapons, fire and clothing. That knowledge was  transmitted from generation to generation not genetically but culturally.  Our pre-human ancestors in the Great Rift Valley used such know-  ledge too, and our own species must have come into existence already  dependent on it for survival. As evidence of that, note that I would soon  die if I tried to live in the Great Rift Valley in its primeval state: I do  not have the requisite knowledge. Since then, there have been human  populations who, for instance, knew how to survive in the Amazon  jungle but not in the Arctic, and populations for whom it was the other  way round. Therefore that knowledge was not part of their genetic  inheritance. It was created by human thought, and preserved and  transmitted in human culture. Today, almost the entire capacity of the Earth’s ‘life-support system  for humans’ has been provided not  for  us but  by  us, using our ability  to create new knowledge. There are people in the Great Rift Valley  today who live far more comfortably than early humans did, and in  far greater numbers, through knowledge of things like tools, farming  and hygiene. The Earth did provide the raw materials for our survival  – just as the sun has provided the energy, and supernovae provided the  elements, and so on. But a heap of raw materials is not the same thing  as a life-support system. It takes knowledge to convert the one into  the other, and biological evolution never provided us with enough  knowledge to survive, let alone to thrive. In this respect we differ from  almost all other species. They do have all the knowledge that they need,  genetically encoded in their brains. And that knowledge was indeed  provided for them by evolution – and so, in the relevant sense, ‘by the  biosphere’. So  their  home environments do have the appearance of  having been designed as life-support systems for them, albeit only in  the desperately limited sense that I have described. But the biosphere  no more provides humans with a life-support system than it provides  us with radio telescopes. So the biosphere is incapable of supporting human life. From the  outset, it was only human knowledge that made the planet even  marginally habitable by humans, and the enormously increased capacity  of our life-support system since then (in terms both of numbers and  of security and quality of life) has been entirely due to the creation of  51 The Spark human knowledge. To the extent that we are on a ‘spaceship’, we have  never been merely its passengers, nor (as is often said) its stewards, nor  even its maintenance crew: we are its designers and builders. Before  the designs created by humans, it was not a vehicle, but only a heap  of dangerous raw materials. The ‘passengers’ metaphor is a misconception in another sense too.  It implies that there was a time when humans lived unproblematically:  when they were provided for, like pas    sengers, without themselves  having to solve a stream of problems in order to survive and to thrive.  But in fact, even with the benefit of their cultural knowledge, our  ancestors continually faced desperate problems, such as where the  next meal was coming from, and typically they barely solved these  problems or they died. There are very few fossils of old people. The moral component of the Spaceship Earth metaphor is therefore  somewhat paradoxical. It casts humans as ungrateful for gifts which,  in reality, they never received. And it casts all other species in morally  positive roles in the spaceship’s life-support system, with humans as  the only negative actors. But humans are part of the biosphere, and  the supposedly immoral behaviour is identical to what all other species  do when times are good – except that humans alone try to mitigate the  effect of that response on their descendants and on other species.  The Principle of Mediocrity is paradoxical too. Since it singles out  anthropocentrism for special opprobrium among all forms of parochial  misconception, it is itself anthropocentric. Also, it claims that all value  judgements are anthropocentric, yet it itself is often expressed in value- laden terminology, such as ‘arrogance’, ‘just scum’ and the very word  ‘mediocrity’. With respect to whose values are those disparagements  to be understood? Why is arrogance even relevant as a criticism? Also,  even if holding an arrogant opinion is morally wrong, morality is  supposed to======================================================== be, the purpose of science. Consider an audience watching  a conjuring trick. The problem facing them has much the same logic  as a scientific problem. Although in nature there is no conjurer trying  to deceive us intentionally, we can be mystified in both cases for  essentially the same reason: appearances are not self-explanatory. If  the explanation of a conjuring trick were evident in its appearance,  there would be no trick. If the explanations of physical phenomena  were evident in their appearance, empiricism would be true and there  would be no need for science as we know it. The problem is not to predict the trick’s appearance. I may, for  instance, predict that if a conjurer seems to place various balls under  various cups, those cups will later appear to be empty; and I may  predict that if the conjurer appears to saw someone in half, that person  15 The Reach of Explanations will later appear on stage unharmed. Those are testable predictions. I  may experience many conjuring shows and see my predictions vindi- cated every time. But that does not even address, let alone solve, the  problem of how the trick works. Solving it requires an explanation: a  statement of the reality that accounts for the appearance. Some people may enjoy conjuring tricks without ever wanting to  know how they work. Similarly, during the twentieth century, most  philosophers, and many scientists, took the view that science is incapable  of discovering anything about reality. Starting from empiricism, they  drew the inevitable conclusion (which would nevertheless have horrified  the early empiricists) that science cannot validly do more than predict  the outcomes of observations, and that it should never purport to  describe the reality that brings those outcomes about. This is known as  instrumentalism.  It denies that what I have been calling ‘explanation’  can exist at all. It is still very influential. In some fields (such as statistical  analysis) the very word ‘explanation’ has come to mean prediction, so  that a mathematical formula is said to ‘explain’ a set of experimental  data. By ‘reality’ is meant merely the  observed data  that the formula is  supposed to approximate. That leaves no term for assertions about  reality itself, except perhaps ‘useful fiction’. Instrumentalism is one of many ways of denying  realism ,   the common- sense, and true, doctrine that the physical world really exists, and is  accessible to rational inquiry. Once one has denied this, the logical  implication is that all claims about reality are equivalent to myths,    none of them being better than the others in any objective sense. That  is  relativism ,   the doctrine that statements in a given field cannot be  objectively true or false: at most they can be judged so relative to some  cultural or other arbitrary standard. Instrumentalism, even aside from the philosophical enormity of  reducing science to a collection of statements about human experiences,  does not make sense in its own terms. For there is no such thing as a  purely predictive, explanationless theory. One cannot make even the  simplest prediction without invoking quite a sophisticated explanatory  framework. For example, those predictions about conjuring tricks  apply specifically to conjuring tricks. That is explanatory information,  and it tells me, among other things, not to ‘extrapolate’ the predictions  to another type of situation, however successful they are at predicting  16 the beginning of infinity conjuring tricks. So I know not to predict that saws in general are  harmless to humans; and I continue to predict that if  I  were to place  a ball under a cup, it really would go there and stay there.  The concept of a conjuring trick, and of the distinction between it  and other situations, is familiar and unproblematic – so much so that it  is easy to forget that it depends on substantive explanatory theories  about all sorts of things such as how our senses work, how solid matter  and light behave, and also subtle cultural details. Knowledge that is both  familiar and uncontroversial is  background knowledge.  A predictive  theory whose explanatory content consists only of back  ground know- ledge is a  rule of thumb . Because we usually take background knowledge  for granted, rules of thumb may seem to be explanationless predictions,  but that is always an illusion.  There is always an explanation, whether we know it or not, for why  a rule of thumb works. Denying that some regularity in nature has an  explanation is effectively the same as believing in the supernatural –  saying, ‘That’s not conjuring, it’s actual magic.’ Also, there is always  an explanation when a rule of thumb  fails , for rules of thumb are  always parochial: they hold only in a narrow range of familiar circum- stances. So, if an unfamiliar feature were introduced into a cups-  and-balls trick, the rule of thumb I stated might easily make a false  prediction. For instance, I could not======================================================== persuaded that  thievery was beneficial, wouldn’t their first reaction to those setbacks  be that there was  not enough  thievery going on? Wouldn’t they enact  laws to encourage it still further? socrates:  Alas, yes – at first. Yet, no matter how firmly they were  persuaded, these setbacks would be  problems  in their lives, which  they would want to solve. A few among them would eventually begin  to suspect that increased thievery might not be the solution after all.  So they would think about it more. They would have been convinced  of the benefits of thievery by some explanation or other. Now they  would try to explain why the supposed solution didn’t seem to be  working. Eventually they would find an explanation that seemed  better. So gradually they would persuade others of that – and so on  until a majority again opposed thievery.  hermes:  Aha! So salvation would come about through persuasion.  socrates: If  you like. Thought, explanation and persuasion. And  now they would understand better  why  thievery is harmful, through  their new explanations.* *Which some would mistakenly think were ‘derived from experience’. 235 A Dream of Socrates hermes: By  the way, the little story we have just imagined is exactly  how Athens really does look, from my point of view. socrates: [ somewhat resentfully ] How you must laugh at us! hermes:  Not at all, Athenian. As I said, I honour you. Now, let us  consider what would happen if, instead of legalizing thievery, their  error had been to  ban debate.  And to ban philosophy and politics  and elections and that whole constellation of activities, and to  consider them shameful. socrates: I  see. That would have the effect of banning  persuasion.  And hence it would block off that path to salvation that we have  discussed. This is a rare and deadly sort of error: it prevents itself  from being undone. hermes: Or at  least it makes salvation immensely more difficult, yes.  This is what  Sparta  looks like, to me.  socrates: I  see. And to me too, now that you point it out. In the past  I have often pondered the many differences between our two cities,  for I must confess that there was – and still is – much that I admire  about the Spartans. But I had never realized before now that those  differences are all superficial. Beneath their evident virtues and vices,  beneath even the fact that they are bitter enemies of Athens, Sparta  is the victim – and the servant – of a profound evil. This is a momentous  revelation, noble Apollo, better than a thousand declarations of the  Oracle, and I cannot adequately express my gratitude. hermes: [ Nods in acknowledgement. ]  socrates: I  also see why you urge me always to bear human fallibility  in mind. In fact, since you mentioned that  some  moral truths follow  logically from epistemological considerations, I am now wondering  whether they  all  do. Could it be that the moral imperative  not to  destroy the means of correcting mistakes  is the only moral imperative?  That all other moral truths follow from it? hermes: [ Is silent. ] socrates: As  you wish. Now, in regard to Athens, and to what you  were saying about epistemology: if our prospects for discovering  new knowledge are so good, why were you stressing the unreliability  of the senses? hermes: I  was correcting your description of the quest for knowledge  as striving to ‘see beyond what is easy to see’.  236 the beginning of infinity socrates: I  meant that metaphorically: ‘see’ in the sense of  ‘understand’. hermes: Yes.  Nevertheless, you have conceded that even those things  that you thought were the easiest to see  literally  are in fact not easy  to see at all without prior knowledge about them. In fact  nothing  is  easy to see without prior knowledge. All knowledge of the world is  hard to come by. Moreover – socrates:  Moreover, it follows that we do not come by it through  seeing . It does not flow into us through our senses. hermes:  Exactly. socrates: Yet  you say that objective knowledge is attainable. So, if  it does not come to us through the senses, where it does come from? hermes:  Suppose I were to tell you that all knowledge comes from  persuasion . socrates:  Persuasion again! Well, I would reply – with all due respect  – that that makes no sense. Whoever persuades me of something  must first have discovered it himself, so in such a case the relevant  issue is where  his  knowledge came from – hermes:  Quite right, unless – socrates:  And, in any case, when I learn something through  persuasion, it  is  coming to me via my senses. hermes: No,  there you are mistaken. It only seems that way to you. socrates:  What? hermes: W ell, you are learning things from me now, aren’t you? Are  they coming to you through your senses? socrates: Yes, of  course they are. Oh – no they’re not. But that is  only because you, a supernatural being, are bypassing my senses and  sending me knowledge in a dream.  hermes: Am I? socrates: I  thought you said you’re not======================================================== few kilometres, making  it so dense that most of its matter has been transmuted into neutrons).  It is not known whether this hypothetical neutron analogue of chemistry  exists – nor whether it could exist if the laws of physics were slightly  98 the beginning of infinity different. Nor do we have any idea what other sorts of environment  permitting the emergence of life would exist under those variant    laws. (The idea that similar laws of physics can be expected to give  rise to similar environments is undermined by the very existence of    fine-tuning.) Nevertheless, regardless of whether the fine-tuning constitutes an  appearance of design or not, it does constitute a legitimate and significant  scientific problem, for the following reason. If the truth is that the  constants of nature are  not  fine-tuned to produce life after all, because  most slight variations in them do still permit life and intelligence to  evolve somehow, though in dramatically different types of environment,  then this would be an unexplained regularity in nature and hence a  problem for science to address. If the laws of physics  are  fine-tuned, as they seem to be, then  there are two possibilities: either those laws are the only ones to be  instantiated in reality (as universes) or there are other regions of reality  – parallel universes* – with different laws. In the former case, we must  expect there to be an explanation of why the laws are as they are. It  would either refer to the existence of life or not. If it did, that would  take us back to Paley’s problem: it would mean that the laws had the  ‘appearance of design’ for creating life, but  had not  evolved. Or the  explanation would not refer to the existence of life, in which case it  would leave unexplained why, if the laws are as they are for non-life- related reasons, they are fine-tuned to create life. If there are many parallel universes, each with its own laws of  physics, most of which do not permit life, then the idea would be that  the observed fine-tuning is only a matter of parochial perspective. It is  only in the universes that contain astrophysicists that anyone ever  wonders why the constants seem fine-tuned. This type of explanation  is known as ‘anthropic reasoning’. It is said to follow from a principle  known as the ‘weak anthropic principle’, though really no principle is  required: it is just logic. (The qualifier ‘weak’ is there because several  other anthropic principles have been proposed, which are more than  just logic, but they need not concern us here.) *These are not the ‘parallel universes’ of the  quantum  multiverse, which I shall describe  in Chapter 11. Those universes all obey the same laws of physics and are in constant  slight interaction with each other. They are also much less speculative. 99 Creation However, on closer examination, anthropic arguments never quite  finish the explanatory job. To see why, consider an argument due to  the physicist Dennis Sciama. Imagine that, at some time in the future, theoreticians have calculated,  for one of those constants of physics, the range of its values for which  there would be a reasonable probability that astrophysicists (of a  suitable kind) would emerge. Say that range is from 137 to 138. (No  doubt the real values will not be whole numbers, but let us keep it  simple.) They also calculate that the highest probability of astrophysicists  occurs at the midpoint of the range – when the constant is 137.5.  Next, experimentalists set out to measure the value of that constant  directly – in laboratories, or by astronomical observation, say. What  should they predict? Curiously enough, one immediate prediction from  the anthropic ex      planation is that the value will not be exactly 137.5.  For suppose that it were. By analogy, imagine that the bull’s-eye of a  dartboard represents the values that can produce astrophysicists. It  would be a mistake to predict that a typical dart that strikes the bull’s  eye will strike it at the exact centre. Likewise, in the overwhelming  majority of universes in which the measurement could take place  (because they contain astrophysicists), the constant would not take the  exactly optimal value for producing astrophysicists, nor be extremely  close to it, compared with the size of the bull’s-eye. So Sciama concludes that, if we did measure one of those constants  of physics, and found that it was extremely close to the optimum    value for producing astrophysicists, that would statistically refute, not  corroborate, the anthropic explanation for its value. Of course that  value  might  still be a coincidence, but if we were willing to accept  astronomically unlikely coincidences as explanations we should not  be puzzled by the fine-tuning in the first place – and we should tell  Paley that the watch on the heath  might  just have been formed  by chance. Furthermore, astrophysicists should be relatively unlikely in universes  whose conditions are so======================================================== positivism  312, 313,  325 logical  313, 314,  325 postmodernism  314, 448 potential infinity  165 ‘potentialities’, quantum  309 precautionary principle  see under  pessimism predators  48, 52, 89, 91, 144, 203, 359,  360–61 predictions  5, 6, 7, 8, 11, 17, 20–22, 24,  44, 136, 153, 175, 181, 182, 189,  206, 256, 277–8, 281, 293, 300,  300, 322, 359, 415, 451 and anthropic reasoning  99–103,  178, 179–80 481 index of Darwinism  96, 371 and explanation  27–9, 70–73, 112– 13, 116, 117, 209, 324 high-level  107–9, 110 and instrumentalism  15–16, 112 fundamental limitations on  see  unpredictability low-level  107–9 and multiple universes  99–103,  177–80 and prophecy  198, 432, 439;

A good design is  hard to vary : If the different parts had been differently shaped from what they are, of  a different size from what they are, or placed after any other manner, or  in any other order, than that in which they are placed, either no motion  at all would have been carried on in the machine, or none which would  have answered the use that is now served by it. 86 the beginning of infinity Merely being useful for a purpose, without being hard to vary while  still serving that purpose, is not a sign of adaptation or design. For  instance, one can also use the sun to keep time, but all its features  would serve that purpose equally well if slightly (or even massively)  altered. Just as we transform many of the Earth’s non-adapted raw  materials to meet our purposes, so we also find uses for the sun that  it was never designed or adapted to provide. The knowledge, in that  case, is entirely in us – and in our sundials – not in the sun. But it  is  embodied in the watch, and in the mouse. So, how did all that knowledge come to be embodied in those things?  As I said, Paley could conceive of only one explanation. That was his  first mistake: The inference we think is inevitable, that the watch must have had a   maker . . . There cannot be design without a designer; contrivance without  a contriver; order without choice; arrangement without anything capable  of arranging; subserviency and relation to a purpose without that which  could intend a purpose; means suitable to an end . . . without the end ever  having been contemplated or the means accommodated to it. Arrangement,  disposition of parts, subserviency of means to an end, relation of instru- ments to a use imply the presence of intelligence and mind. We now know that there  can  be ‘design without a designer’: know  ledge  without a person who created it. Some types of knowledge can be  created by evolution. I shall come to that shortly. But it is no criticism  of Paley that he was unaware of a discovery that had yet to be made  – one of the greatest discoveries in the history of science.  However, although Paley was spot on in his understanding of the  problem , he somehow did not realize that his proposed solution,  creationism, does not solve it, and is even ruled out by his own argu- ment. For the ultimate designer for whose existence Paley was arguing  would also be a purposeful and complex entity – certainly no less so  than a watch or a living organism. Hence, as many critics have since  noticed, if we substitute ‘ultimate designer’ for ‘watch’ in Paley’s text  above, we force Paley to ‘the [inevitable] inference . . . that the ultimate  designer must have had a maker’. Since that is a contradiction, the  argument from design as perfected by Paley rules out the existence of  an ultimate designer. 87 Creation Note that this is not a disproof of the existence of God, any more  than the original argument was a proof. But it does show that, in any  good explanation of the origin of biological adaptations, God cannot  play the role assigned by creationism. Though this is the opposite of  what Paley believed he had achieved, none of us can choose what our  ideas imply. His argument has universal reach for anything that has,  by his criterion, the appearance of design. As an elucidation of the  special status of living things, and in setting a benchmark that ex    - planations of knowledge-laden entities must meet if they are to make  sense, it is essential to understanding the world. Lamarckism Before Darwin’s theory of evolution, people had already been wonder- ing whether the biosphere and its adaptations might have come into  existence gradually. Darwin’s grandfather Erasmus Darwin (1731– 1802), a stalwart of the Enlightenment, was among them. They called  that process ‘evolution’, but the meaning of the word then was different  from its primary one today.  All  processes of gradual improvement,  regardless of their mechan  ism, were known as ‘evolution’. (That  terminology survives to this day in casual usage and as a technical term  in, of all places, theoretical physics, where ‘evolution’ means any sort  of continuous change that one is explaining through laws of physics.)  Charles Darwin distinguished the process that he discovered by calling  it ‘evolution by natural selection’ – though a better name would have  been ‘evolution by variation and selection’. As Paley might well have recognized if he had lived to hear of it,  ‘evolution by natural selection’ is a much more substantive mode of  explanation than mere ‘evolution’. For the latter does not solve his  problem, while the former does.  Any  theory about improvement raises  the question: how is the knowledge of how to make that improvement  created? Was it already present at the outset? The theory that it was is  creationism. Did it ‘just happen’? The theory that it did is spontaneous  generation. During======================================================== why that must be so, starting with the fallibility  of the human mind and the unreliability of sensory experience.  plato : [ Scribbles,   ‘It’s only knowledge  of the material world  that’s  impossible, useless and undesirable.’ ] socrates: He  gave me a marvellous perspective on how we perceive  the world. Each of your eyes is like a dark little cave, one on whose  rear wall some stray shadows fall from outside. You spend your  whole life at the back of that cave, able to see nothing but that rear  wall, so you cannot see reality directly at all.  plato : [ Scribbles,   ‘It is as if we were prisoners, chained inside a cave  and permitted to look only at the rear wall. We can never know the  253 A Dream of Socrates reality outside because we see only fleeting, distorted shadows of it.’ ] [Note: Socrates is slightly improving on Hermes, and Plato has  been increasingly misinterpreting Socrates.] socrates: He  then went on to explain to me that objective knowledge  is indeed possible: it comes from within! It begins as conjecture, and  is then  corrected  by repeated cycles of criticism, including comparison  with the evidence on our ‘wall’.  plato : [ Scribbles,   ‘The only true knowledge is that which comes from  within. (How? Remembered from a previous life?)’ ] socrates: In  this way, we frail and fallible humans can come to know  objective reality – provided we use philosophically sound methods  as I have described (which most people do not). plato : [ Scribbles,   ‘We can come to know the true world beyond the  illusory world of experience. But only by pursuing the kingly art of  philosophy.’ ] chaerephon:  Socrates, I think it  was  the god speaking to you, for I  strongly feel that I have glimpsed a divine truth through you today.  It will take me a long time to reorganize my ideas to take account  of this new epistemology that he revealed to you. It seems a  tremendously far-reaching, and important, subject. socrates:  Indeed. I have some reorganizing to do myself. plato : Socrates, you really ought to write all this down – together  with all your other wisdom – for the benefit of the whole world, and  posterity. socrates: No  need, Aristocles. Posterity is right here, listening.  Posterity is all of  you , my friends. What is the point of writing down  things that are going to be endlessly tinkered with and improved?  Rather than make a permanent record of all my misconceptions as  they are at a particular instant, I would rather offer them to others  in two-way debate. That way I benefit from criticism and may even  make improvements myself. Whatever is valuable will survive such  debates and be passed on without any effort from me. Whatever is  not valuable would only make me look a fool to future generations. plato : If you say so, Master. Since Socrates left us no writings, historians of ideas can only guess at  what he really thought and taught, using the indirect evidence of his  254 the beginning of infinity portrayal by Plato and a few others who were there at the time and  whose accounts have survived. This is known as the ‘Socratic problem’,  and is the source of much controversy. One common view is that the  young Plato conveyed Socrates’ philosophy fairly faithfully, but that  later he used the character of Socrates more as a vehicle for conveying  his own views; that he did not even intend his dialogues to represent  the real Socrates, but used them only as convenient ways of expressing  arguments that have a to-and-fro form.  Perhaps I had better stress – in case it is not already obvious – that  I am doing the same. I do not intend the above dialogue accurately to  represent the philosophical opinions of the historical Socrates and  Plato. I have set it at that moment in history, with those participants,  because Socrates and his circle were among the foremost contributors  to the ‘Golden Age of Athens’, which should have become a beginning  of infinity but did not. And also because one thing that we do know  about the ancient Greeks is that the philosophical  problems  they  considered important have dominated Western philosophy ever since:  How is knowledge obtained? How can we distinguish between true  and false, right and wrong, reason and unreason? Which sorts of  knowledge (moral, empirical, theological, mathematical, justified . . . )  are possible, and which are mere chimeras? And so on. And therefore,  although the theory of knowledge presented in the dialogue is largely  that of the twentieth-century philosopher Karl Popper, together with  some addenda of my own, I guess that Socrates would have understood  and liked it. In some universes that were very like ours at the time, he  thought of it himself. I do want to make one indirect comment on the Socratic problem,  though: we habitually underestimate the difficulty of communication  – just as Socrates does at the end of the dialogue, when he assumes  that each party to a debate necessarily knows what the other is saying,======================================================== success. A pessimistic civil- ization considers it immoral to behave in ways that have not been tried  many times before, because it is blind to the possibility that the benefits  of doing so might offset the risks. So it is intolerant and conformist.  But Athens took the opposite view. Pericles also contrasted his city’s  openness to foreign visitors with the closed, defensive attitude of rival  cities: again, he expected that Athens would benefit from contact with  new, unforeseeable ideas, even though, as he acknowledged, this policy  gave enemy spies access to the city too. He even seems to have regarded  the lenient treatment of children as a source of military strength: In education, where our rivals from their very cradles by a painful  discipline seek after manliness, in Athens we live exactly as we please,  and yet are just as ready to encounter every legitimate danger. 218 the beginning of infinity A pessimistic civilization prides itself on its children’s conformity to  the proper patterns of behaviour, and bemoans every real or imagined  novelty. Sparta was, in all the above respects, the opposite of Athens. The  epitome of a pessimistic civilization, it was notorious for its citizens’  austere ‘spartan’ lifestyle, for the harshness of its educational system,  and for the total militarization of its society. Every male citizen was a  full-time soldier, owing absolute obedience to his superiors, who were  themselves obliged to follow religious tradition. All other work was  done by slaves: Sparta had reduced an entire neighbouring society,    the Messenians, to the status of helots (a kind of serf or slave). It    had no philosophers, historians, artists, architects, writers – or other  knowledge-creating people of any kind apart from the occasional  talented general. Thus almost the entire effort of the society was  devoted to preserving itself in its existing state – in other words, to  preventing improvement. In 404 bce, twenty-seven years after Pericles’  funeral oration, Sparta decisively defeated Athens in war and imposed  an authoritarian form of government on it. Although, through the  vagaries of international politics, Athens became independent and  democratic again soon afterwards, and continued for several gener- ations to produce art, literature and philosophy, it was never again  host to rapid, open-ended progress. It became unexceptional. Why? I  guess that its optimism was gone. Another short-lived enlightenment happened in the Italian city-state  of Florence in the fourteenth century. This was the time of the early  Renaissance, a cultural movement that revived the literature, art and  science of ancient Greece and Rome after more than a millennium of  intellectual stagnation in Europe. It became an  enlightenment  when  the Florentines began to believe that they could improve upon that  ancient knowledge. This era of dazzling innovation, known as the  Golden Age of Florence, was deliberately fostered by the Medici family,  who were in effect the city’s rulers – especially Lorenzo de’ Medici,  known as ‘the Magnificent’, who was in charge from 1469 to 1492.  Unlike Pericles, the Medici were not devotees of democracy: Florence’s  enlightenment began not in politics but in art, and then philosophy,  science and technology, and in those fields it involved the same openness  to criticism and desire for innovation both in ideas and in action.  219 Optimism Artists, instead of being restricted to traditional themes and styles,  became free to depict what they considered beautiful, and to invent  new styles. Encouraged by the Medici, the wealthy of Florence competed  with each other in the innovativeness of the artists and scholars    whom they sponsored – such as Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo and  Botticelli. Another denizen of Florence at this time was Niccolò  Machiavelli, the first secular political philosopher since antiquity.  The Medici were soon promoting the new philosophy of ‘humanism’,  which valued knowledge above dogma, and virtues such as intellectual  independence, curiosity, good taste and friendship over piety and  humility. They sent agents all over the known world to obtain copies  of ancient books, many of which had not been seen in the West since  the fall of the Western Roman Empire. The Medici library made copies  which it supplied to scholars in Florence and elsewhere. Florence  became a powerhouse of newly revived ideas, new interpretations of  ideas, and brand-new ideas. But that rapid progress lasted for only a generation or so. A  charismatic monk, Girolamo Savonarola, began to preach apocalyptic  sermons against humanism and every other aspect of the Florentine  enlightenment. Urging a return to medieval conformism and self-denial,  he proclaimed prophecies of doom if Florence continued on its path.  Many citizens were persuaded, and in 1494 Savonarola managed    to seize power. He reimposed all the traditional restrictions on art,  literature, thought and======================================================== later survival will depend on being able to  cope when prevention and delaying tactics have failed. Obviously we  need to work towards cures. But we can do that only for diseases that  we already know about. So we need the capacity to deal with unfore- seen, unforeseeable failures. For this we need a large and vibrant  research community, interested in explanation and problem-solving.  We need the wealth to fund it, and the technological capacity to  implement what it discovers. This is also true of the problem of climate change, about which there  is currently great controversy. We face the prospect that carbon-dioxide  emissions from technology will cause an increase in the average temp- erature of the atmosphere, with harmful effects such as droughts,  sea-level rises, disruption to agriculture, and the extinctions of some  species. These are forecast to outweigh the beneficial effects, such as  an increase in crop yields, a general boost to plant life, and a reduction  in the number of people dying of hypothermia in winter. Trillions of  dollars, and a great deal of legislation and institutional change, in    - tended to reduce those emissions, currently hang on the outcomes of  simulations of the planet’s climate by the most powerful supercomputers,  and on projections by economists about what those computations  imply about the economy in the next century. In the light of the above  discussion, we should notice several things about the controversy and  about the underlying problem. First, we have been lucky so far. Regardless of how accurate the  prevailing climate models are, it is uncontroversial from the laws of  physics, without any need for supercomputers or sophisticated model- ling, that such emissions  must ,  eventually ,   increase the temperature,  which must, eventually, be harmful. Consider, therefore: what if the  relevant parameters had been just slightly different and the moment  of disaster had been in, say, 1902 – Veblen’s time – when carbon-  dioxide emissions were already orders of magnitude above their  pre-Enlightenment values. Then the disaster would have happened  438 the beginning of infinity before anyone could have predicted it or known what was happening.  Sea levels would have risen, agriculture would have been disrupted,  millions would have begun to die, with worse to come. And the great  issue of the day would have been not how to prevent it but what could  be done about it .  They had no supercomputers then. Because of Babbage’s failures  and the scientific community’s misjudgements – and, perhaps most  importantly, their lack of wealth –  they lacked the vital technology of  automated computing altogether. Mechanical calculators and roomfuls  of clerks would have been insufficient. But, much worse: they had  almost no atmospheric physicists. In fact the total number of physicists  of all kinds was a small fraction of the number who today work on  climate change alone. From society’s point of view, physicists were a  luxury in 1902, like colour televisions were in the 1970s. Yet, to recover  from the disaster, society would have needed more scientific knowledge,  and better technology, and more of it – that is to say, more wealth. For  instance, in 1900, building a sea wall to protect the coast of a low-lying  island would have required resources so enormous that the only islands  that could have afforded it would have been those with either large  concentrations of cheap labour or exceptional wealth, as in the Nether- lands, much of whose population already lived below sea level thanks  to the technology of dyke-building.  This is a challenge that is highly susceptible to automation. But people  were in no position to address it in that way. All relevant machines were  underpowered, unreliable, expensive, and impossible to produce in large  numbers. An enormous effort to construct a Panama canal had just failed  with the loss of thousands of lives and vast amounts of money, due to  inadequate technology and scientific know  ledge. And, to compound  those problems, the world as a whole had very little wealth by today’s  standards. Today, a coastal defence project would be well within the  capabilities of almost any coastal nation – and would add decades to  the time available to find other solutions to rising sea levels. If none are found, what would we do  then ? That is a question of a  wholly different kind, which brings me to my second observation on  the climate-change controversy. It is that, while the supercomputer  simulations make (conditional)  predictions , the economic forecasts  make almost pure  prophecies . For we can expect the future of human  439 Unsustainable responses to climate to depend heavily on how successful people are  at creating new knowledge to address the problems that arise. So  comparing predictions with prophecies is going to lead to that same  old mistake.  Again, suppose that disaster had already been under way in 1902.

Would the laws  of morality still be the same if the laws of physics were different?    If they were such that knowledge could best be obtained by blind  obedience to authority, then scientists would have to  avoid  what we  think of as the values of scientific inquiry in order to make progress .   My guess is that morality is more autonomous than that, and so it  makes sense to say that such laws of physics would be  immoral , and  (as I remarked in Chapter 4) to imagine laws of physics that would be  more moral than the real ones. The reach of ideas into the world of abstractions is a property of  the knowledge that they contain, not of the brain in which they may  happen to be instantiated. A theory can have infinite reach even if the  person who originated it is unaware that it does. However, a  person  is  an abstraction too. And there is a kind of infinite reach that is unique  to people: the reach of the ability to understand explanations. And this  ability is itself an instance of the wider phenomenon of  universality   – to which I turn next. terminology Levels of emergence   Sets of phenomena that can be explained well  in terms of each other without analysing them into their constituent  entities such as atoms. Natural numbers   The whole numbers 1, 2, 3 and so on. Reductionism  The misconception that science must or should always  explain things by analysing them into components (and hence that  higher-level explanations cannot be fundamental). 124 the beginning of infinity Holism  The misconception that all significant explanations are of  components in terms of wholes rather than vice versa. Moral philosophy  Addresses the problem of what sort of life to want. meanings of ‘the beginning of infinity’  encountered in this chapter – The existence of emergent phenomena, and the fact that they can  encode knowledge about other emergent phenomena. – The existence of levels of approximation to true explanations. – The ability to understand explanations. – The ability of explanation to escape from parochialism by ‘letting  our theories die in our place’. summary Reductionism and holism are both mistakes. In reality, explanations do  not form a hierarchy with the lowest level being the most fundamental.  Rather, explanations at any level of emergence can be fundamental.  Abstract entities are real, and can play a role in causing physical  phenomena. Causation is itself such an abstraction.  125 6 The Jump to Universality The earliest writing systems used stylized pictures – ‘pictograms’ – to  represent words or concepts. So a symbol like ‘  ’ might stand for ‘sun’,  and ‘  ’ for ‘tree’. But no system ever came close to having a pictogram  for  every  word in its spoken language. Why not?  Originally, there was no intention to do so. Writing was for special- ized applications such as inventories and tax records. Later, new  applications would require larger vocabularies, but by then scribes  would increasingly have found it easier to add new  rules  to their  writing system rather than new pictograms. For example, in some  systems, if a word sounded like two or more other words in sequence,  it could be represented by the pictograms for those words. If English  were written in pictograms, that would allow us to write the word  ‘treason’ as ‘   ’. This would not represent the sound of the word  precisely (nor does its actual spelling, for that matter), but it would  approximate it well enough for any reader who spoke the language  and was aware of the rule.  Following that innovation, there would have been less incentive to  coin new pictograms – say ‘  ’ for ‘treason’. Coining one would always  have been tedious, not so much because designing memorable picto- grams is hard – though it is – but because, before one could use it, one  would somehow have to inform all intended readers of its meaning.  That is hard to do: if it had been easy, there would have been much  less need for writing in the first place. In cases where the rule could be  applied instead, it was more efficient: any scribe could write ‘   ’ and  be understood even by a reader who had never seen the word written  before.  However, the rule could not be applied in all cases: it could not  126 the beginning of infinity represent any new single-syllable words, nor many other words. It  seems clumsy and inadequate compared to modern writing systems.  Yet there was already something significant about it which no purely  pictographic system could achieve: it brought words into the writing  system that no one had explicitly added. That means that it had reach.  And reach always has an explanation. Just as in science a simple  formula may summarize a mass of facts, so a simple, easily remembered  rule can bring many additional words into a writing system, but only  if it reflects an underlying regularity. The regularity in this case is that  all the words in======================================================== consecutive cubes in any direction  the story would be the same.  Cold, dark and empty. That unimaginably desolate environment is  typical of the universe – and is another measure of how  un typical the  Earth and its chemical scum are, in a straightforward physical sense.  48 the beginning of infinity The issue of the cosmic significance of this type of scum will shortly  take us back out into intergalactic space. But let me first return to  Earth, and consider the Spaceship Earth metaphor, in  its  straightforward  physical version.  This much is true: if, tomorrow, physical conditions on the Earth’s  surface were to change even slightly by astrophysical standards, then  no humans could live here unprotected, just as they could not survive  on a spaceship whose life-support system had broken down. Yet I am  writing this in Oxford, England, where winter nights are likewise often  cold enough to kill any human unprotected by clothing and other  technology. So, while intergalactic space would kill me in a matter of  seconds, Oxfordshire in its primeval state might do it in a matter of  hours – which can be considered ‘life support’ only in the most contrived  sense. There  is  a life-support system in Oxfordshire today, but it was  not provided by the biosphere. It has been built by humans. It consists  of clothes, houses, farms, hospitals, an electrical grid, a sewage system  and so on. Nearly the whole of the Earth’s biosphere in its primeval  state was likewise incapable of keeping an unprotected human alive  for long. It would be much more accurate to call it a death trap for  humans rather than a life-support system. Even the Great Rift Valley  in eastern Africa, where our species evolved, was barely more hospitable  than primeval Oxfordshire. Unlike the life-support system in that  imagined spaceship, the Great Rift Valley lacked a safe water supply,  and medical equipment, and comfortable living quarters, and was  infested with predators, parasites and disease organisms. It frequently  injured, poisoned, drenched, starved and sickened its ‘passengers’, and  most of them died as a result.  It was similarly harsh to all the other organisms that lived there:    few individuals live comfortably or die of old age in the supposedly  beneficent biosphere. That is no accident: most populations, of most  species, are living close to the edge of disaster and death. It has to be  that way, because as soon as some small group, somewhere, begins to  have a slightly easier life than that, for any reason – for instance, an  increased food supply, or the extinction of a competitor or predator –  then its numbers increase. As a result, its other resources are depleted  by the increased usage; so an increasing proportion of the population  now has to colonize more marginal habitats and make do with inferior  49 The Spark resources, and so on. This process continues until the disadvantages  caused by the increased population have exactly balanced the advantage  conferred by the beneficial change. That is to say, the new birth rate is  again just barely keeping pace with the rampant disabling and killing  of individuals by starvation, exhaustion, predation, overcrowding and  all those other natural processes. That is the situation to which evolution adapts organisms. And that,  therefore, is the lifestyle in which the Earth’s biosphere ‘seems adapted’  to sustaining them. The biosphere only ever achieves stability – and  only temporarily at that – by continually neglecting, harming, disabling  and killing individuals. Hence the metaphor of a spaceship or a life- support system, is quite perverse: when humans design a life-support  system, they design it to provide the maximum possible comfort, safety  and longevity for its users within the available resources; the biosphere  has no such priorities.  Nor is the biosphere a great preserver of  species . In addition to being  notoriously cruel to individuals, evolution involves continual extinctions  of entire species. The average rate of extinction since the beginning of  life on Earth has been about ten species per year (the number is known  only very approximately), becoming much higher during the relatively  brief periods that palaeontologists call ‘mass extinction events’. The  rate at which species have come into existence has on balance only  slightly exceeded the extinction rate, and the net effect is that the  overwhelming majority of species that have ever existed on Earth  (perhaps 99.9 per cent of them) are now extinct. Genetic evidence  suggests that our own species narrowly escaped extinction on at least  one occasion. Several species closely related to ours did become extinct.  Significantly, the ‘life-support system’ itself wiped them out – by means  such as natural disasters, evolutionary changes in other species, and  climate change. Those cousins of ours had not invited extinction by  changing their lifestyles or overloading the biosphere: on the
