It is always the same-sized ﬂash.  The only  thing that happens as the light is made dimmer  is that sometimes we hear a “click” from the detector but see  no ﬂash at all.  The electron has gone by without being “seen.” What we are observing is that light also  acts like electrons; we  knew  that it was “wavy,” but now we ﬁnd that it is also “lumpy.” It always arrives—or is scattered—  in lumps that we call “photons.” As we turn down the  intensity  of the light source we do not change the  size  of the photons, only the rate  at which they are emitted.  That  explains why, when our source is dim, some electrons get by without being seen. There did not happen to be a photon around at the time the electron went through. This is all a little discouraging. If it is true that whenever we “see” the electron we see the same-sized ﬂash, then those electrons we see are  always  the disturbed ones. Let us try the experiment with a dim light anyway. Now whenever we hear a click in the detector we will keep a count in three columns: in Column 1 those electrons seen by hole 1, in Column 2 those electrons seen by hole 2, and in Column 3 those electrons not seen at all. When we work up our data (computing the probabilities) we ﬁnd these results: Those “seen by hole 1” have a distribution like  P' 1 ; those “seen by hole 2” have a distribution like  P' 2  (so that those “seen by either hole 1 or 2” have a distribution like  P' 12 ); and those “not seen at all” have a “wavy” distribution just like  P 12 of Fig. 6-3!  If the electrons are not seen, we have interference! That is understandable. When we do not see the electron, no photon disturbs it, and when we do see it, a photon has disturbed it. There is always the same amount of disturbance because the light photons all produce the same-sized effects and the effect of the photons being scattered is enough to smear out any interference effect. Is there not  some  way we can see the electrons without disturbing them? We learned in an earlier chapter that the momentum carried by a “photon” is inversely proportional to its wavelength ( p = h/ l ). Certainly the jolt given to the electron when the photon is scattered 130 Six Easy Pieces 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:01 PM  Page 130 toward our eye depends on the momentum that photon carries. Aha! If we want to disturb the electrons only slightly we should not have lowered the  intensity  of the light; we should have lowered its frequency  (the same as increasing its wavelength). Let us use light of a redder color. We could even use infrared light, or radiowaves (like radar), and “see” where the electron went with the help of some equipment that can “see” light of these longer wavelengths. If we use “gentler” light perhaps we can avoid disturbing the elec- trons so much. Let us try the experiment with longer waves. We shall keep re- peating our experiment, each time with light of a longer wave- length. At ﬁrst, nothing seems to change. The results are the same. Then a terrible thing happens. You remember that when we dis- cussed the microscope we pointed out that, due to the  wave nature of the light, there is a limitation on how close two spots can be and still be seen as two separate spots. This distance is of the order of the wavelength of light. So now, when we make the wavelength longer than the distance between our holes, we see a  big  fuzzy ﬂash when the light is scattered by the electrons. We can no longer tell which hole the electron went through! We just know it went some- where! And it is just with light of this color that we ﬁnd that the jolts given to the electron are small enough so that  P' 12 begins to look like  P 12 —that we begin to get some interference effect. And it is only for wavelengths much longer than the separation of the two holes (when we have no chance at all of telling where the elec- tron went) that the disturbance due to the light gets sufficiently small that we again get the curve  P 12 shown in Fig. 6-3. In our experiment we ﬁnd that it is impossible to arrange the light in such a way that one can tell which hole the electron went through, and at the same time not disturb the pattern. It was sug- gested by Heisenberg that the then-new laws of nature could only be consistent if there were some basic limitation on our experimen- tal capabilities not previously recognized. He proposed, as a general principle, his  uncertainty principle,  which we can state in terms of our experiment as follows: “It is impossible to design an apparatus 131 Quantum Behavior 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:01 PM  Page 131 to determine which hole the electron passes through, that will not at the same time disturb the electrons enough to destroy the inter- ference pattern.” If an apparatus is capable of determining which hole the electron goes through, it  cannot  be so======================================================== ultimately, not understood. It is understood that if something is pushing something else, it snaps and will slide—that is all right. But what pushes, and why? The theory is that there are currents inside the earth—circulating currents, due to the difference in temperature inside and outside—which, in their motion, push the surface slightly. Thus if there are two op- posite circulations next to each other, the matter will collect in 62 Six Easy Pieces 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:01 PM  Page 62 the region where they meet and make belts of mountains which are in unhappy stressed conditions, and so produce volcanoes and earthquakes. What about the inside of the earth? A great deal is known about the speed of earthquake waves through the earth and the density of distribution of the earth. However, physicists have been unable to get a good theory as to how dense a substance should be at the pressures that would be expected at the center of the earth. In other words, we cannot ﬁgure out the properties of matter very well in these circumstances. We do much less well with the earth than we do with the conditions of matter in the stars. The math- ematics involved seems a little too difficult, so far, but perhaps it will not be too long before someone realizes that it is an important problem, and really works it out. The other aspect, of course, is that even if we did know the density, we cannot ﬁgure out the cir- culating currents. Nor can we really work out the properties of rocks at high pressure. We cannot tell how fast the rocks should “give”; that must all be worked out by experiment. Psychology Next, we consider the science of  psychology.  Incidentally, psycho- analysis is not a science: it is at best a medical process, and perhaps even more like witch-doctoring. It has a theory as to what causes disease—lots of different “spirits,” etc. The witch doctor has a theory that a disease like malaria is caused by a spirit which comes into the air; it is not cured by shaking a snake over it, but quinine does help malaria. So, if you are sick, I would advise that you go to the witch doctor because he is the man in the tribe who knows the most about the disease; on the other hand, his knowledge is not science. Psychoanalysis has not been checked carefully by ex- periment, and there is no way to ﬁnd a list of the number of cases in which it works, the number of cases in which it does not work, etc. 63 The Relation of Physics to Other Sciences 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:01 PM  Page 63 The other branches of psychology, which involve things like the physiology of sensation—what happens in the eye, and what hap- pens in the brain—are, if you wish, less interesting. But some small but real progress has been made in studying them. One of the most interesting technical problems may or may not be called psychol- ogy. The central problem of the mind, if you will, or the nervous system, is this: when an animal learns something, it can do some- thing different than it could before, and its brain cell must have changed too, if it is made out of atoms.  In what way is it different? We do not know where to look, or what to look for, when some- thing is memorized. We do not know what it means, or what change there is in the nervous system, when a fact is learned. This is a very important problem which has not been solved at all. As- suming, however, that there is some kind of memory thing, the brain is such an enormous mass of interconnecting wires and nerves that it probably cannot be analyzed in a straightforward manner. There is an analog of this to computing machines and computing elements, in that they also have a lot of lines, and they have some kind of element, analogous, perhaps, to the synapse, or connection of one nerve to another. This is a very interesting subject which we have not the time to discuss further—the relationship between thinking and computing machines. It must be appreciated, of course, that this subject will tell us very little about the real com- plexities of ordinary human behavior. All human beings are so dif- ferent. It will be a long time before we get there. We must start much further back. If we could even ﬁgure out how a  dog  works, we would have gone pretty far. Dogs are easier to understand, but nobody yet knows how dogs work. How did it get that way? In order for physics to be useful to other sciences in a  theoretical way, other than in the invention of instruments, the science in question must supply to the physicist a description of the object in 64 Six Easy Pieces 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:01 PM  Page 64 a physicist’s language. They can say “why does a frog jump?,” and the physicist cannot answer. If they tell him what a frog is, that there are so many molecules, there is a nerve here, etc., that is dif- ferent. If they will tell us, more or less, what the earth or the stars are like, then we can ﬁgure it out. In order for physical theory to be of any======================================================== energy  in the way. In order to add an extra atom to our chemical requires that we get it  close  enough that some rearrangement can occur; then it will stick. But if we cannot give it enough energy to get it close enough, it will not go to com- pletion it will just go partway up the “hill” and back down again. However, if we could literally take the molecules in our hands and push and pull the atoms around in such a way as to open a hole to let the new atom in, and then let it snap back, we would have found another way,  around  the hill, which would not require extra energy, 52 Six Easy Pieces 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:01 PM  Page 52 and the reaction would go easily. Now there actually  are , in the cells,  very  large molecules, much larger than the ones whose changes we have been describing, which in some complicated way hold the smaller molecules just right, so that the reaction can occur easily. These very large and complicated things are called  enzymes . (They were ﬁrst called ferments, because they were originally discovered in the fermentation of sugar. In fact, some of the ﬁrst reactions in the cycle were discovered there.) In the presence of an enzyme the reaction will go. An enzyme is made of another substance called  protein .Enzymes are very big and complicated, and each one is different, each being built to control a certain special reaction. The names of the enzymes are written in Fig. 3-1 at each reaction. (Sometimes the same en- zyme may control two reactions.) We emphasize that the enzymes themselves are not involved in the reaction directly. They do not 53 The Relation of Physics to Other Sciences Figure 3-1 The Krebs cycle. 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:01 PM  Page 53 change; they merely let an atom go from one place to another. Hav- ing done so, the enzyme is ready to do it to the next molecule, like a machine in a factory. Of course, there must be a supply of certain atoms and a way of disposing of other atoms. Take hydrogen, for example: there are enzymes which have special units on them which carry the hydrogen for all chemical reactions. For example, there are three or four hydrogen-reducing enzymes which are used all over our cycle in different places. It is interesting that the machinery which liberates some hydrogen at one place will take that hydrogen and use it somewhere else. The most important feature of the cycle of Fig. 3-1 is the transfor- mation from GDP to GTP (guanosine-di-phosphate to guanosine- tri-phosphate) because the one substance has much more energy in it than the other. Just as there is a “box” in certain enzymes for car- rying hydrogen atoms around, there are special  energy -carrying “boxes” which involve the triphosphate group. So, GTP has more energy than GDP and if the cycle is going one way, we are produc- ing molecules which have extra energy and which can go drive some other cycle which  requires  energy, for example the contraction of muscle. The muscle will not contract unless there is GTP. We can take muscle ﬁber, put it in water, and add GTP, and the ﬁbers con- tract, changing GTP to GDP if the right enzymes are present. So the real system is in the GDP-GTP transformation; in the dark the GTP which has been stored up during the day is used to run the whole cycle around the other way. An enzyme, you see, does not care in which direction the reaction goes, for if it did it would vi- olate one of the laws of physics. Physics is of great importance in biology and other sciences for still another reason, that has to do with  experimental techniques. In fact, if it were not for the great development of experimental physics, these biochemistry charts would not be known today. The reason is that the most useful tool of all for analyzing this fantastically complex system is to  label  the atoms which are used in the reactions. Thus, if we could introduce into the cycle some 54 Six Easy Pieces 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:01 PM  Page 54 carbon dioxide which has a “green mark” on it, and then measure after three seconds where the green mark is, and again measure after ten seconds, etc., we could trace out the course of the reac- tions. What are the “green marks”? They are different  isotopes.  We recall that the chemical properties of atoms are determined by the number of  electrons,  not by the mass of the nucleus. But there can be, for example in carbon, six neutrons or seven neutrons, to- gether with the six protons which all carbon nuclei have. Chem- ically, the two atoms C 12 and C 13 are the same, but they differ in weight and they have different nuclear properties, and so they are distinguishable. By using these isotopes of different weights, or even radioactive isotopes like C 14 , which provide a more sensitive means for tracing very small quantities, it is possible to trace the reactions. Now, we return to the description of enzymes and proteins. All proteins are not enzymes, but all enzymes are proteins. There======================================================== with nothing touch- ing it and completely undisturbed, it will go on forever, coasting at a uniform speed in a straight line. ( Why  does it keep on coasting? We do not know, but that is the way it is.) Newton modiﬁed this idea, saying that the only way to change the motion of a body is to use  force.  If the body speeds up, a force has been applied  in the direction of motion.  On the other hand, if its motion is changed to a new  direction,  a force has been applied sideways.  Newton thus added the idea that a force is needed to change the speed  or the direction  of motion of a body. For example, if a stone is attached to a string and is whirling around in a circle, it takes a force to keep it in the circle. We have to  pull  on the string. In fact, the law is that the acceleration produced by the force is inversely proportional to the mass, or the force is propor- tional to the mass times the acceleration. The more massive a thing is, the stronger the force required to produce a given acceleration. (The mass can be measured by putting other stones on the end of the same string and making them go around the same circle at the same speed. In this way it is found that more or less force is re- quired, the more massive object requiring more force.) The bril- liant idea resulting from these considerations is that no  tangential force is needed to keep a planet in its orbit (the angels do not have to ﬂy tangentially) because the planet would coast in that direction anyway. If there were nothing at all to disturb it, the planet would go off in a  straight line.  But the actual motion deviates from the line on which the body would have gone if there were no force, the deviation being essentially  at right angles  to the motion, not in the direction of the motion. In other words, because of the prin- ciple of inertia, the force needed to control the motion of a planet around the sun is not a force  around  the sun but  toward  the sun. (If there is a force toward the sun, the sun might be the angel, of course!) 93 The Theory of Gravitation 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:01 PM  Page 93 Newton’s law of gravitation From his better understanding of the theory of motion, Newton appreciated that  the sun  could be the seat or organization of forces that govern the motion of the planets. Newton proved to himself (and perhaps we shall be able to prove it soon) that the very fact that equal areas are swept out in equal times is a precise signpost of the proposition that all deviations are precisely  radial —that the law of areas is a direct consequence of the idea that all of the forces are directed exactly  toward the sun. Next, by analyzing Kepler’s third law it is possible to show that the farther away the planet, the weaker the forces. If two planets at different distances from the sun are compared, the analysis shows that the forces are inversely proportional to the squares of the re- spective distances. With the combination of the two laws, Newton concluded that there must be a force, inversely as the square of the distance, directed in a line between the two objects. Being a man of considerable feeling for generalities, Newton supposed, of course, that this relationship applied more generally than just to the sun holding the planets. It was already known, for example, that the planet Jupiter had moons going around it as the moon of the earth goes around the earth, and Newton felt certain that each planet held its moons with a force. He already knew of the force holding  us  on the earth, so he proposed that this was a universal  force— that everything pulls everything else. The next problem was whether the pull of the earth on its people was the “same” as its pull on the moon, i.e., inversely as the square of the distance. If an object on the surface of the earth falls 16 feet in the ﬁrst second after it is released from rest, how far does the moon fall in the same time? We might say that the moon does not fall at all. But if there were no force on the moon, it would go off in a straight line, whereas it goes in a circle instead, so it really  falls in  from where it would have been if there were no force at all. We can calculate from the radius of the moon’s orbit (which is about 240,000 miles) and how long it takes to go around the earth (ap- 94 Six Easy Pieces 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:01 PM  Page 94 proximately 29 days) how far the moon moves in its orbit in one second, and can then calculate how far it falls in one second.* This distance turns out to be roughly  1 / 20 of an inch in a second. That ﬁts very well with the inverse square law, because the earth’s radius is 4000 miles, and if something which is 4000 miles from the center of the earth falls 16 feet in a second, something 240,000 miles, or 60 times as far away, should fall only  1 / 3600 of 16 feet, which also is roughly  1 / 20 of an inch. Wishing to put this theory of gravitation to a test by similar calculations, Newton======================================================== momentum.  Besides these, there are three other conservation laws, that are exact so far as we can tell today, which  are  much simpler to understand because they are in the nature of counting blocks. The ﬁrst of the three is the  conservation of charge,  and that merely means that you count how many positive, minus how many nega- tive electrical charges you have, and the number is never changed. You may get rid of a positive with a negative, but you do not create any net excess of positives over negatives. Two other laws are anal- ogous to this one—one is called the  conservation of baryons . There are a number of strange particles, a neutron and a proton are ex- amples, which are called baryons. In any reaction whatever in na- ture, if we count how many baryons are coming into a process, the number of baryons* which come out will be exactly the same. There is another law, the  conservation of leptons . We can say that the group of particles called leptons are electron, mu meson, and neutrino. There is an antielectron which is a positron, that is, a –1 lepton. Counting the total number of leptons in a reaction reveals that the number in and out never changes, at least so far as we know at present. These are the six conservation laws, three of them subtle, involv- ing space and time, and three of them simple, in the sense of count- ing something. With regard to the conservation of energy, we should note that available  energy is another matter—there is a lot of jiggling around in the atoms of the water of the sea, because the sea has a certain temperature, but it is impossible to get them herded into a deﬁnite motion without taking energy from somewhere else. That is, al- though we know for a fact that energy is conserved, the energy available for human utility is not conserved so easily. The laws which govern how much energy is available are called the  laws of thermodynamics  and involve a concept called entropy for irreversible thermodynamic processes. 85 Conservation of Energy * Counting antibaryons as –1 baryon. 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:01 PM  Page 85 Finally, we remark on the question of where we can get our sup- plies of energy today. Our supplies of energy are from the sun, rain, coal, uranium, and hydrogen. The sun makes the rain, and the coal also, so that all these are from the sun. Although energy is con- served, nature does not seem to be interested in it; she liberates a lot of energy from the sun, but only one part in two billion falls on the earth. Nature has conservation of energy, but does not really care; she spends a lot of it in all directions. We have already ob- tained energy from uranium; we can also get energy from hydrogen, but at present only in an explosive and dangerous condition. If it can be controlled in thermonuclear reactions, it turns out that the energy that can be obtained from 10 quarts of water per second is equal to all of the electrical power generated in the United States. With 150 gallons of running water a minute, you have enough fuel to supply all the energy which is used in the United States today! Therefore it is up to the physicist to ﬁgure out how to liberate us from the need for having energy. It can be done. 86 Six Easy Pieces 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:01 PM  Page 86 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:01 PM  Page 87 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:01 PM  Page 88 THE THEORY OF GRAVITATION Planetary motions In this chapter we shall discuss one of the most far-reaching generalizations of the human mind. While we are admiring the human mind, we should take some time off to stand in awe of a nature  that could follow with such completeness and generality such an elegantly simple principle as the law of gravitation. What is this law of gravitation? It is that every object in the universe at- tracts every other object with a force which for any two bodies is proportional to the mass of each and varies inversely as the square of the distance between them. This statement can be expressed mathematically by the equation If to this we add the fact that an object responds to a force by ac- celerating in the direction of the force by an amount that is in- versely proportional to the mass of the object, we shall have said everything required, for a sufficiently talented mathematician could then deduce all the consequences of these two principles. However, . FG r mm' 2 = 89 5 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:01 PM  Page 89 since you are not assumed to be sufficiently talented yet, we shall discuss the consequences in more detail, and not just leave you with only these two bare principles. We shall brieﬂy relate the story of the discovery of the law of gravitation and discuss some of its con- sequences, its effects on history, the mysteries that such a law en- tails, and some reﬁnements of the law made by Einstein; we shall also discuss the relationships of the law to the other laws of physics. All this cannot be done in one======================================================== with the forms actually exhibited by crystals as they occur in nature. The angles between the various “faces” of a crystal agree, within seconds of arc, with angles deduced on the assump- tion that a crystal is made of many “layers” of atoms. Everything is made of atoms.  That is the key hypothesis. The most important hypothesis in all of biology, for example, is that  every- thing that animals do, atoms do.  In other words,  there is nothing that living things do that cannot be understood from the point of view that they are made of atoms acting according to the laws of physics.  This was not known from the beginning: it took some experimenting and theorizing to suggest this hypothesis, but now it is accepted, and it is the most useful theory for producing new ideas in the ﬁeld of biology. If a piece of steel or a piece of salt, consisting of atoms one next to the other, can have such interesting properties; if water—which is nothing but these little blobs, mile upon mile of the same thing over the earth—can form waves and foam, and make rushing noises and strange patterns as it runs over cement; if all of this, all the life of a stream of water, can be nothing but a pile of atoms,  how much more is possible ? If instead of arranging the atoms in some deﬁnite pattern, again and again repeated, on and on, or even forming little lumps of complexity like the odor of violets, we make an arrange- ment which is  always different  from place to place, with different kinds of atoms arranged in many ways, continually changing, not repeating, how much more marvelously is it possible that this thing might behave? Is it possible that that “thing” walking back and forth in front of you, talking to you, is a great glob of these atoms 20 Six Easy Pieces 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:01 PM  Page 20 in a very complex arrangement, such that the sheer complexity of it staggers the imagination as to what it can do? When we say we are a pile of atoms, we do not mean we are  merely  a pile of atoms, because a pile of atoms which is not repeated from one to the other might well have the possibilities which you see before you in the mirror. 21 Atoms in Motion 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:01 PM  Page 21 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:01 PM  Page 22 BASIC PHYSICS Introduction In this chapter, we shall examine the most fundamental ideas that we have about physics—the nature of things as we see them at the present time. We shall not discuss the history of how we know that all these ideas are true; you will learn these details in due time. The things with which we concern ourselves in science appear in myriad forms, and with a multitude of attributes. For example, if we stand on the shore and look at the sea, we see the water, the waves breaking, the foam, the sloshing motion of the water, the sound, the air, the winds and the clouds, the sun and the blue sky, and light; there is sand and there are rocks of various hardness and permanence, color and texture. There are animals and seaweed, hunger and disease, and the observer on the beach; there may be even happiness and thought. Any other spot in nature has a similar variety of things and inﬂuences. It is always as complicated as that, no matter where it is. Curiosity demands that we ask questions, that we try to put things together and try to understand this mul- titude of aspects as perhaps resulting from the action of a relatively small number of elemental things and forces acting in an inﬁnite variety of combinations. For example: Is the sand other than the rocks? That is, is the sand perhaps nothing but a great number of very tiny stones? Is the moon a great rock? If we understood rocks, would we  also understand the 23 2 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:01 PM  Page 23 sand and the moon? Is the wind a sloshing of the air analogous to the sloshing motion of the water in the sea? What common features do different movements have? What is common to different kinds of sound? How many different colors are there? And so on. In this way we try gradually to analyze all things, to put together things which at ﬁrst sight look different, with the hope that we may be able to  reduce  the number of  different  things and thereby under- stand them better. A few hundred years ago, a method was devised to ﬁnd partial answers to such questions.  Observation, reason,  and  experiment make up what we call the  scientiﬁc method.  We shall have to limit ourselves to a bare description of our basic view of what is some- times called  fundamental physics,  or fundamental ideas which have arisen from the application of the scientiﬁc method. What do we mean by “understanding” something? We can imag- ine that this complicated array of moving things which constitutes “the world” is something like a great chess game being played by the gods, and we are observers of the game. We do not know what the rules of the game are; all we are allowed to do is to  watch  the playing.======================================================== chapter, but these subjects will be treated in due time in subsequent chapters. The story begins with the ancients observing the motions of plan- ets among the stars, and ﬁnally deducing that they went around the sun, a fact that was rediscovered later by Copernicus. Exactly  how the planets went around the sun, with exactly  what motion , took a little more work to discover. In the beginning of the ﬁfteenth century there were great debates as to whether they really went around the sun or not. Tycho Brahe had an idea that was different from any- thing proposed by the ancients: his idea was that these debates about the nature of the motions of the planets would best be resolved if the actual positions of the planets in the sky were measured suffi- ciently accurately. If  measurement showed exactly how the planets moved, then perhaps it would be possible to establish one or another viewpoint. This was a tremendous idea—that to ﬁnd something out, it is better to perform some careful experiments than to carry on deep philosophical arguments. Pursuing this idea, Tycho Brahe stud- ied the positions of the planets for many years in his observatory on the island of Hven, near Copenhagen. He made voluminous tables, which were then studied by the mathematician Kepler, after Tycho’s death. Kepler discovered from the data some very beautiful and re- markable, but simple, laws regarding planetary motion. Kepler’s laws First of all, Kepler found that each planet goes around the sun in a curve called an  ellipse , with the sun at a focus of the ellipse. An el- lipse is not just an oval, but is a very speciﬁc and precise curve that 90 Six Easy Pieces 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:01 PM  Page 90 can be obtained by using two tacks, one at each focus, a loop of string, and a pencil; more mathematically, it is the locus of all points the sum of whose distances from two ﬁxed points (the foci) is a constant. Or, if you will, it is a foreshortened circle (Fig. 5-1). Kepler’s second observation was that the planets do not go around the sun at a uniform speed, but move faster when they are nearer the sun and more slowly when they are farther from the sun, in precisely this way: Suppose a planet is observed at any two suc- cessive times, let us say a week apart, and that the radius vector* is drawn to the planet for each observed position. The orbital arc tra- versed by the planet during the week, and the two radius vectors, bound a certain plane area, the shaded area shown in Fig. 5-2. If two similar observations are made a week apart, at a part of the orbit farther from the sun (where the planet moves more slowly), the similarly bounded area is exactly the same as in the ﬁrst case. So, in accordance with the second law, the orbital speed of each planet is such that the radius “sweeps out” equal areas in equal times. Finally, a third law was discovered by Kepler much later; this law is of a different category from the other two, because it deals not with only a single planet, but relates one planet to another. This law says that when the orbital period and orbit size of any two plan- ets are compared, the periods are proportional to the  3 / 2 power of 91 The Theory of Gravitation * A radius vector is a line drawn from the sun to any point in a planet’s orbit. Figure 5-1 An ellipse. 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:01 PM  Page 91 the orbit size. In this statement the period is the time interval it takes a planet to go completely around its orbit, and the size is mea- sured by the length of the greatest diameter of the elliptical orbit, technically known as the major axis. More simply, if the planets went in circles, as they nearly do, the time required to go around the circle would be proportional to the  3 / 2 power of the diameter (or radius). Thus Kepler’s three laws are: I. Each planet moves around the sun in an ellipse, with the sun at one focus. II. The radius vector from the sun to the planet sweeps out equal areas in equal intervals of time. III. The  squares of the periods of any two planets are proportional to the cubes of the semimajor axes of their respective orbits: T  μ a 3/2 . Development of dynamics While Kepler was discovering these laws, Galileo was studying the laws of motion. The problem was, what makes the planets go around? (In those days, one of the theories proposed was that the planets went around because behind them were invisible angels, beating their wings and driving the planets forward. You will see that this theory is now modiﬁed! It turns out that in order to keep the planets going around, the invisible angels must ﬂy in a different 92 Six Easy Pieces Figure 5-2 Kepler’s law of areas. 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:01 PM  Page 92 direction and they have no wings. Otherwise, it is a somewhat sim- ilar theory!) Galileo discovered a very remarkable fact about mo- tion, which was essential for understanding these laws. That is the principle of  inertia —if something is moving,======================================================== 30, 38, 40 Psychology, physics and, 63–  64 Quantum behavior atomic mechanics, 115–  17 bullets, experiment with, 117– 19 electron waves, interference of, 124–  27 electrons, experiment with, 122– 24,  127– 33 waves, experiment with, 120– 22 Quantum chemistry, 49 Quantum electrodynamics (QED), x, 37–  38, 43–  44 Quantum mechanics of chemistry, 26, 48 deﬁned, 116 ﬁrst principles of, 133–  36 144 Index 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:01 PM  Page 144 gravitation and, 113 properties of, 33–  38 uncertainty principle, 136–  38 Radar waves, 32 Radiant energy, 71, 83 Radio waves, 31 Radius vector, 91 Reason, scientiﬁc method and, 24 Relativity gravity and, 112–  13 theory of, 43 Reproduction, 57–  59 Repulsion, electrical force and, 28 Resonances, 40, 42 Respiratory cycle, 52 Reversible machines, 73–  76 Ribosomes, 58, 59 RNA, 58–  59 “Rules of the game,” 24–  25 S number, particles, 40 Salt, dissolving in water, 13–  15 Sands, Prof. Matthew, xxviii Schwinger, Julian, xxii Scientiﬁc method, 24 Screw jack, 78 Sensation, physiology of, 64 Short-range interaction force, 28 Sigma baryons, 41, 42 Sodium chloride, 13 Solids atomic hypothesis, 9 dissolving in water, 13–  15 Solution, precipitation and, 14 Sound, waves of excess density and, 28 Space, conservation of momentum, 84, 85 Space, time and, 27, 33, 44 Stars, 59–  61, 65–  66, 101–  4 Statistical mechanics, 48–  49, 60 Steam, atomic hypothesis, 6–  8 Steam engines, 71 Stevinus, 78 “Strangeness” number, particles, 40, 42 Strong particle interactions, 43– 44 Substances, properties of, 26 Sun, planetary motion and, 90– 92 Symmetry, atoms in ice, 9 Technetium, 60 Temperature, 8–  10 geology and, 62–  63 Thermodynamics, 49, 85 Thermonuclear reactions, 86 Thymine, 57 Tides, pull of the moon and, 97– 98,  99f Time, conservation of energy and, 84, 85 Time, space and, 27, 33 TNT explosion, 38 Tomanaga, Sin-Itero, xxii Torsion ﬁber, 105 Total internal reﬂection, 115 Transpiration, 17 Turbulent ﬂow, 62 Turbulent ﬂuids, 66 Ultraviolet frequencies, 32 Unbalanced electrical force, 29 145 Index 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:01 PM  Page 145 Universal gravitation, 98–  104 Universe, age of, 110–  11 Velocity, kinetic energy and, 81 Vertical motions, 95, 96f Virtual work, principle of, 79 Volcanism, 62–  63 Water atomic hypothesis, 4–  10 dissolving solids in, 13–  15 evaporation, 11–  13 Water vapor, 11–  13, 17 Waves behavior of, 32–  33, 36 electromagnetic, 31–  33 excess density, sound and, 28 quantum behavior experiment with, 120–  22 Weak decay particle interactions, 43– 44 Weather, 61–  62, 66 Weight-lifting machines, 72–  76 Work, virtual, 79 X-rays, 26, 32–  33 Yukawa, 38–39 Zero-charge particles, 40 Zero mass, 43 Zero-mass particles, 40 146 Index 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:01 PM  Page 146======================================================== reversible machines, because every time we move a large clump of stuff, the atoms do not remain absolutely undisturbed, and so a 82 Six Easy Pieces 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:01 PM  Page 82 certain amount of random motion goes into the atomic system. We cannot see it, but we can measure it with thermometers, etc.) There are many other forms of energy, and of course we cannot describe them in any more detail just now. There is electrical energy, which has to do with pushing and pulling by electric charges. There is radiant energy, the energy of light, which we know is a form of electrical energy because light can be represented as wigglings in the electromagnetic ﬁeld. There is chemical energy, the energy which is released in chemical reactions. Actually, elastic energy is, to a certain extent, like chemical energy, because chemical energy is the energy of the attraction of the atoms, one for the other, and so is elastic energy. Our modern understanding is the following: chemical energy has two parts, kinetic energy of the electrons inside the atoms, so part of it is kinetic, and electrical energy of interaction of the electrons and the protons—the rest of it, therefore, is elec- trical. Next we come to nuclear energy, the energy which is involved with the arrangement of particles inside the nucleus, and we have formulas for that, but we do not have the fundamental laws. We know that it is not electrical, not gravitational, and not purely chemical, but we do not know what it is. It seems to be an addi- tional form of energy. Finally, associated with the relativity theory, there is a modiﬁcation of the laws of kinetic energy, or whatever you wish to call it, so that kinetic energy is combined with another thing called  mass energy.  An object has energy from its sheer  existence.  If I have a positron and an electron, standing still doing nothing—never mind gravity, never mind anything—and they come together and disappear, radiant energy will be liberated, in a deﬁnite amount, and the amount can be calculated. All we need know is the mass of the object. It does not depend on what it is—we make two things disappear, and we get a certain amount of energy. The formula was ﬁrst found by Einstein; it is  E  =  mc 2 . It is obvious from our discussion that the law of conservation of energy is enormously useful in making analyses, as we have illus- trated in a few examples without knowing all the formulas. If we 83 Conservation of Energy 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:01 PM  Page 83 had all the formulas for all kinds of energy, we could analyze how many processes should work without having to go into the details. Therefore conservation laws are very interesting. The question nat- urally arises as to what other conservation laws there are in physics. There are two other conservation laws which are analogous to the conservation of energy. One is called the conservation of linear mo- mentum. The other is called the conservation of angular momen- tum. We will ﬁnd out more about these later. In the last analysis, we do not understand the conservation laws deeply. We do not un- derstand the conservation of energy. We do not understand energy as a certain number of little blobs. You may have heard that pho- tons come out in blobs and that the energy of a photon is Planck’s constant times the frequency. That is true, but since the frequency of light can be anything, there is no law that says that energy has to be a certain deﬁnite amount. Unlike Dennis’s blocks, there can be any amount of energy, at least as presently understood. So we do not understand this energy as counting something at the mo- ment, but just as a mathematical quantity, which is an abstract and rather peculiar circumstance. In quantum mechanics it turns out that the conservation of energy is very closely related to another important property of the world,  things do not depend on the absolute time.  We can set up an experiment at a given moment and try it out, and then do the same experiment at a later moment, and it will behave in exactly the same way. Whether this is strictly true or not, we do not know. If we assume that it  is  true, and add the prin- ciples of quantum mechanics, then we can deduce the principle of the conservation of energy. It is a rather subtle and interesting thing, and it is not easy to explain. The other conservation laws are also linked together. The conservation of momentum is associated in quantum mechanics with the proposition that it makes no dif- ference  where  you do the experiment, the results will always be the same. As independence in space has to do with the conservation of momentum, independence of time has to do with the conservation of energy, and ﬁnally, if we  turn  our apparatus, this too makes no difference, and so the invariance of the world to angular orientation 84 Six Easy Pieces 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:01 PM  Page 84 is related to the conservation of  angular======================================================== consider the time it takes light to go across a proton, 10 –24 sec- ond. If we compare this time with the  age of the universe,  2  ¥ 10 10 years, the answer is 10 –42 . It has about the same number of zeros going off it, so it has been proposed that the gravitational constant is related to the age of the universe. If that were the case, the grav- itational constant would change with time, because as the universe 110 Six Easy Pieces Figure 5-14 The relative strengths of electrical and gravitational interactions between two electrons.  0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:01 PM  Page 110 got older the ratio of the age of the universe to the time which it takes for light to go across a proton would be gradually increasing. Is it possible that the gravitational constant  is  changing with time? Of course the changes would be so small that it is quite difficult to be sure. One test which we can think of is to determine what would have been the effect of the change during the past 10 9 years, which is approximately the age from the earliest life on the earth to now, and one-tenth of the age of the universe. In this time, the gravity constant would have increased by about 10 percent. It turns out that if we consider the structure of the sun—the balance between the weight of its material and the rate at which radiant energy is generated inside it—we can deduce that if the gravity were 10 per- cent stronger, the sun would be much more than 10 percent brighter—by the  sixth power  of the gravity constant! If we calculate what happens to the orbit of the earth when the gravity is changing, we ﬁnd that the earth was then  closer in.  Altogether, the earth would be about 100 degrees centigrade hotter, and all of the water would not have been in the sea, but vapor in the air, so life would not have started in the sea. So we do  not  now believe that the gravity constant is changing with the age of the universe. But such arguments as the one we have just given are not very convincing, and the subject is not completely closed. It is a fact that the force of gravitation is proportional to the mass,  the quantity which is fundamentally a measure of  inertia — of how hard it is to hold something which is going around in a cir- cle. Therefore two objects, one heavy and one light, going around a larger object in the same circle at the same speed because of grav- ity, will stay together because to go in a circle  requires  a force which is stronger for a bigger mass. That is, the gravity is stronger for a given mass in  just the right proportion  so that the two objects will go around together. If one object were inside the other it would stay  inside; it is a perfect balance. Therefore, Gagarin or Titov would ﬁnd things “weightless” inside a spaceship; if they happened 111 The Theory of Gravitation 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:01 PM  Page 111 to let go of a piece of chalk, for example, it would go around the earth in exactly the same way as the whole spaceship, and so it would appear to remain suspended before them in space. It is very interesting that this force is  exactly  proportional to the mass with great precision, because if it were not exactly proportional there would be some effect by which inertia and weight would differ. The absence of such an effect has been checked with great accuracy by an experiment done ﬁrst by Eötvös in 1909 and more recently by Dicke. For all substances tried, the masses and weights are exactly proportional within 1 part in 1,000,000,000, or less. This is a re- markable experiment. Gravity and relativity Another topic deserving discussion is Einstein’s modiﬁcation of Newton’s law of gravitation. In spite of all the excitement it created, Newton’s law of gravitation is not correct! It was modiﬁed by Ein- stein to take into account the theory of relativity. According to Newton, the gravitational effect is instantaneous, that is, if we were to move a mass, we would at once feel a new force because of the new position of that mass; by such means we could send signals at inﬁnite speed. Einstein advanced arguments which suggest that we cannot send signals faster than the speed of light,  so the law of gravi- tation must be wrong. By correcting it to take the delays into ac- count, we have a new law, called Einstein’s law of gravitation. One feature of this new law which is quite easy to understand is this: In the Einstein relativity theory, anything which has  energy  has mass— mass in the sense that it is attracted gravitationally. Even light, which has an energy, has a “mass.” When a light beam, which has energy in it, comes past the sun there is an attraction on it by the sun. Thus the light does not go straight, but is deﬂected. During the eclipse of the sun, for example, the stars which are around the sun should appear displaced from where they would be if the sun were not there, and this has been observed. Finally, let us compare gravitation with other theories. In recent 112======================================================== are many proteins, such as the proteins in muscle, the structural pro- teins which are, for example, in cartilage and hair, skin, etc., that are not themselves enzymes. However, proteins are a very charac- teristic substance of life: ﬁrst of all they make up all the enzymes, and second, they make up much of the rest of living material. Pro- teins have a very interesting and simple structure. They are a series, or chain, of different  amino acids.  There are twenty different amino acids, and they all can combine with each other to form chains in which the backbone is CO-NH, etc. Proteins are nothing but chains of various ones of these twenty amino acids. Each of the amino acids probably serves some special purpose. Some, for ex- ample, have a sulfur atom at a certain place; when two sulfur atoms are in the same protein, they form a bond, that is, they tie the chain together at two points and form a loop. Another has extra oxygen atoms which make it an acidic substance; another has a basic char- acteristic. Some of them have big groups hanging out to one side, so that they take up a lot of space. One of the amino acids, called proline, is not really an amino acid, but imino acid. There is a slight 55 The Relation of Physics to Other Sciences 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:01 PM  Page 55 difference, with the result that when proline is in the chain, there is a kink in the chain. If we wished to manufacture a particular pro- tein, we would give these instructions: put one of those sulfur hooks here; next, add something to take up space; then attach something to put a kink in the chain. In this way, we will get a complicated- looking chain, hooked together and having some complex struc- ture; this is presumably just the manner in which all the various enzymes are made. One of the great triumphs in recent times (since 1960) was at last to discover the exact spatial atomic arrangement of certain proteins, which involve some ﬁfty-six or sixty amino acids in a row. Over a thousand atoms (more nearly two thousand, if we count the hydrogen atoms) have been located in a complex pattern in two proteins. The ﬁrst was hemoglobin. One of the sad aspects of this discovery is that we cannot see anything from the pattern; we do not understand why it works the way it does. Of course, that is the next problem to be attacked. Another problem is how do the enzymes know what to be? A red-eyed ﬂy makes a red-eyed ﬂy baby, and so the information for the whole pattern of enzymes to make red pigment must be passed from one ﬂy to the next. This is done by a substance in the nucleus of the cell, not a protein, called DNA (short for deoxyribonucleic acid). This is the key substance which is passed from one cell to an- other (for instance, sperm cells consist mostly of DNA) and carries the information as to how to make the enzymes. DNA is the “blue- print.” What does the blueprint look like and how does it work? First, the blueprint must be able to reproduce itself. Secondly, it must be able to instruct the protein. Concerning the reproduction, we might think that this proceeds like cell reproduction. Cells sim- ply grow bigger and then divide in half. Must it be thus with DNA molecules, then, that they too grow bigger and divide in half? Every atom  certainly does not grow bigger and divide in half! No, it is impossible to reproduce a molecule except by some more clever way. The structure of the substance DNA was studied for a long time, ﬁrst  chemically to ﬁnd the composition, and then with x-rays 56 Six Easy Pieces 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:01 PM  Page 56 to ﬁnd the pattern in space. The result was the following remark- able discovery: The DNA molecule is a pair of chains, twisted upon each other. The backbone of each of these chains, which are analogous to the chains of proteins but chemically quite different, is a series of sugar and phosphate groups, as shown in Fig. 3-2. Now we see how the chain can contain instructions, for if we could split this chain down the middle, we would have a series BAADC . . . and every living thing could have a different series. Thus perhaps, in some way, the speciﬁc  instructions  for the man- ufacture of proteins are contained in the speciﬁc  series  of the DNA. Attached to each sugar along the line, and linking the two chains together, are certain pairs of cross-links. However, they are not all of the same kind; there are four kinds, called adenine, thymine, cy- tosine, and guanine, but let us call them  A, B, C,  and  D . The in- teresting thing is that only certain pairs can sit opposite each other, for example  A  with  B  and   C  with  D.  These pairs are put on the two chains in such a way that they “ﬁt together,” and have a strong en- ergy of interaction. However,  C  will not ﬁt with  A,  and  B  will not ﬁt with   C  ; they will only ﬁt in pairs,  A  against  B  and  C  against  D . Therefore if one is   C  , the other must be  D , etc. Whatever the letters may be in======================================================== of atomic particles, which is in the  quantum mechanics of chemistry. The question is, of course, is it going to be possible to amalga- mate  everything,  and merely discover that this world represents dif- ferent aspects of  one  thing? Nobody knows. All we know is that as we go along, we ﬁnd that we can amalgamate pieces, and then we ﬁnd some pieces that do not ﬁt, and we keep trying to put the jig- saw puzzle together. Whether there are a ﬁnite number of pieces, and whether there is even a border to the puzzle, are of course un- 26 Six Easy Pieces 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:01 PM  Page 26 known. It will never be known until we ﬁnish the picture, if ever. What we wish to do here is to see to what extent this amalgamation process has gone on, and what the situation is at present, in under- standing basic phenomena in terms of the smallest set of principles. To express it in a simple manner,  what are things made of and how few elements are there? Physics before 1920 It is a little difficult to begin at once with the present view, so we shall ﬁrst see how things looked in about 1920 and then take a few things out of that picture. Before 1920, our world picture was something like this: The “stage” on which the universe goes is the three-dimensional  space  of geometry, as described by Euclid, and things change in a medium called  time.  The elements on the stage are  particles,  for example the atoms, which have some  properties. First, the property of inertia: if a particle is moving it keeps on going in the same direction unless  forces  act upon it. The second element, then, is  forces,  which were then thought to be of two va- rieties: First, an enormously complicated, detailed kind of interac- tion force which held the various atoms in different combinations in a complicated way, which determined whether salt would dis- solve faster or slower when we raise the temperature. The other force that was known was a long-range interaction—a smooth and quiet attraction—which varied inversely as the square of the dis- tance, and was called  gravitation.  This law was known and was very simple.  Why  things remain in motion when they are moving, or why  there is a law of gravitation, was, of course, not known. A description of nature is what we are concerned with here. From this point of view, then, a gas, and indeed  all  matter, is a myr- iad of moving particles. Thus many of the things we saw while standing at the seashore can immediately be connected. First the pressure: this comes from the collisions of the atoms with the walls or whatever; the drift of the atoms, if they are all moving in one 27 Basic Physics 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:01 PM  Page 27 direction on the average, is wind; the  random  internal motions are the  heat.  There are waves of excess density, where too many par- ticles have collected, and so as they rush off they push up piles of particles farther out, and so on. This wave of excess density is sound.  It is a tremendous achievement to be able to understand so much. Some of these things were described in the previous chapter. What  kinds  of particles are there? There were considered to be 92 at that time: 92 different kinds of atoms were ultimately dis- covered. They had different names associated with their chemical properties. The next part of the problem was,  what are the short-range forces? Why does carbon attract one oxygen or perhaps two oxygens, but not three oxygens? What is the machinery of interaction between atoms? Is it gravitation? The answer is no. Gravity is entirely too weak. But imagine a force analogous to gravity, varying inversely with the square of the distance, but enormously more powerful and having one difference. In gravity everything attracts everything else, but now imagine that there are  two kinds  of “things,” and that this new force (which is the electrical force, of course) has the property that likes  repel  but unlikes  attract.  The “thing” that carries this strong interaction is called  charge. Then what do we have? Suppose that we have two unlikes that attract each other, a plus and a minus, and that they stick very close together. Suppose we have another charge some distance away. Would it feel any attraction? It would feel  practically none,  because if the ﬁrst two are equal in size, the attraction for the one and the repulsion for the other balance out. Therefore there is very little force at any appreciable distance. On the other hand, if we get  very close  with the extra charge,  attraction  arises, because the repulsion of likes and attraction of unlikes will tend to bring unlikes closer together and push likes farther apart. Then the repulsion will be less  than the attraction. This is the reason why the atoms, which are constituted out of plus and minus electric charges, feel very little 28 Six Easy Pieces 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:01 PM  Page 28 force when they are separated by appreciable distance======================================================== electrons as they pass by 129 Quantum Behavior 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:01 PM  Page 129 does  not  get weaker.  It is always the same-sized ﬂash.  The only  thing that happens as the light is made dimmer  is that sometimes we hear a “click” from the detector but see  no ﬂash at all.  The electron has gone by without being “seen.” What we are observing is that light also  acts like electrons; we  knew  that it was “wavy,” but now we ﬁnd that it is also “lumpy.” It always arrives—or is scattered—  in lumps that we call “photons.” As we turn down the  intensity  of the light source we do not change the  size  of the photons, only the rate  at which they are emitted.  That  explains why, when our source is dim, some electrons get by without being seen. There did not happen to be a photon around at the time the electron went through. This is all a little discouraging. If it is true that whenever we “see” the electron we see the same-sized ﬂash, then those electrons we see are  always  the disturbed ones. Let us try the experiment with a dim light anyway. Now whenever we hear a click in the detector we will keep a count in three columns: in Column 1 those electrons seen by hole 1, in Column 2 those electrons seen by hole 2, and in Column 3 those electrons not seen at all. When we work up our data (computing the probabilities) we ﬁnd these results: Those “seen by hole 1” have a distribution like  P' 1 ; those “seen by hole 2” have a distribution like  P' 2  (so that those “seen by either hole 1 or 2” have a distribution like  P' 12 ); and those “not seen at all” have a “wavy” distribution just like  P 12 of Fig. 6-3!  If the electrons are not seen, we have interference! That is understandable. When we do not see the electron, no photon disturbs it, and when we do see it, a photon has disturbed it. There is always the same amount of disturbance because the light photons all produce the same-sized effects and the effect of the photons being scattered is enough to smear out any interference effect. Is there not  some  way we can see the electrons without disturbing them? We learned in an earlier chapter that the momentum carried by a “photon” is inversely proportional to its wavelength ( p = h/ l ). Certainly the jolt given to the electron when the photon is scattered 130 Six Easy Pieces 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:01 PM  Page 130 toward our eye depends on the momentum that photon carries. Aha! If we want to disturb the electrons only slightly we should not have lowered the  intensity  of the light; we should have lowered its frequency  (the same as increasing its wavelength). Let us use light of a redder color. We could even use infrared light, or radiowaves (like radar), and “see” where the electron went with the help of some equipment that can “see” light of these longer wavelengths. If we use “gentler” light perhaps we can avoid disturbing the elec- trons so much. Let us try the experiment with longer waves. We shall keep re- peating our experiment, each time with light of a longer wave- length. At ﬁrst, nothing seems to change. The results are the same. Then a terrible thing happens. You remember that when we dis- cussed the microscope we pointed out that, due to the  wave nature of the light, there is a limitation on how close two spots can be and still be seen as two separate spots. This distance is of the order of the wavelength of light. So now, when we make the wavelength longer than the distance between our holes, we see a  big  fuzzy ﬂash when the light is scattered by the electrons. We can no longer tell which hole the electron went through! We just know it went some- where! And it is just with light of this color that we ﬁnd that the jolts given to the electron are small enough so that  P' 12 begins to look like  P 12 —that we begin to get some interference effect. And it is only for wavelengths much longer than the separation of the two holes (when we have no chance at all of telling where the elec- tron went) that the disturbance due to the light gets sufficiently small that we again get the curve  P 12 shown in Fig. 6-3. In our experiment we ﬁnd that it is impossible to arrange the light in such a way that one can tell which hole the electron went through, and at the same time not disturb the pattern. It was sug- gested by Heisenberg that the then-new laws of nature could only be consistent if there were some basic limitation on our experimen- tal capabilities not previously recognized. He proposed, as a general principle, his  uncertainty principle,  which we can state in terms of our experiment as follows: “It is impossible to design an apparatus 131 Quantum Behavior 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:01 PM  Page 131 to determine which hole the electron passes through, that will not at the same time disturb the electrons enough to destroy the inter- ference pattern.” If an apparatus is capable of determining which hole the electron goes through, it  cannot  be so======================================================== agglomerated into clusters. Perhaps gravitation exists even over distances of  tens of millions  of light-years; so far as we now know, gravity seems to go out forever inversely as the square of the distance. Not only can we understand the nebulae, but from the law of gravitation we can even get some ideas about the origin of the stars. If we have a big cloud of dust and gas, as indicated in Fig. 5-11, the gravitational attractions of the pieces of dust for one another 103 The Theory of Gravitation Figure 5-8 A globular star cluster. 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:01 PM  Page 103 might make them form little lumps. Barely visible in the ﬁgure are “little” black spots which may be the beginning of the accumulations of dust and gases which, due to their gravitation, begin to form stars. Whether we have ever seen a star form or not is still debatable. Fig- ure 5-12 shows the one piece of evidence which suggests that we have. At the left is a picture of a region of gas with some stars in it taken in 1947, and at the right is another picture, taken only seven years later, which shows two new bright spots. Has gas accumulated, has gravity acted hard enough and collected it into a ball big enough that the stellar nuclear reaction starts in the interior and turns it into a star? Perhaps, and perhaps not. It is unreasonable that in only seven years we should be so lucky as to see a star change itself into visible form; it is much less probable that we should see  two! Cavendish’s experiment Gravitation, therefore, extends over enormous distances. But if there is a force between  any  pair of objects, we ought to be able to measure the force between our own objects. Instead of having to 104 Six Easy Pieces Figure 5-9 A galaxy. 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:01 PM  Page 104 watch the stars go around each other, why can we not take a ball of lead and a marble and watch the marble go toward the ball of lead? The difficulty of this experiment when done in such a simple man- ner is the very weakness or delicacy of the force. It must be done with extreme care, which means covering the apparatus to keep the air out, making sure it is not electrically charged, and so on; then the force can be measured. It was ﬁrst measured by Cavendish with an apparatus which is schematically indicated in Fig. 5-13. This ﬁrst demonstrated the direct force between two large, ﬁxed balls of lead and two smaller balls of lead on the ends of an arm supported by a very ﬁne ﬁber, called a torsion ﬁber. By measuring how much the ﬁber gets twisted, one can measure the strength of the force, verify that it is inversely proportional to the square of the distance, and determine how strong it is. Thus, one may accurately deter- mine the coefficient  G  in the formula .

You say, “We knew it al- ready for the earth.” Yes, but we did not know the  mass  of the earth. By knowing  G  from this experiment and by knowing how strongly the earth attracts, we can indirectly learn how great is the mass of the earth! This experiment has been called “weighing the earth” by some people, and it can be used to determine the coefficient   G  of the gravity law. This is the only way in which the mass of the earth can be determined.  G  turns out to be 6.670  ¥ 10 –11 newton ∙ m 2 /kg 2 . It is hard to exaggerate the importance of the effect on the history of science produced by this great success of the theory of gravitation. Compare the confusion, the lack of conﬁdence, the incomplete knowledge that prevailed in the earlier ages, when there were endless debates and paradoxes, with the clarity and simplicity of this law— this fact that all the moons and planets and stars have such a  simple 106 Six Easy Pieces Figure 5-11 An interstellar dust cloud. 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:01 PM  Page 106 rule  to govern them, and further that man could  understand  it and deduce how the planets should move! This is the reason for the success of the sciences in following years, for it gave hope that the other phe- nomena of the world might also have such beautifully simple laws. What is gravity? But is this such a simple law? What about the machinery of it? All we have done is to describe  how  the earth moves around the sun, but we have not said  what makes it go.  Newton made no hypotheses about this; he was satisﬁed to ﬁnd  what  it did without getting into the machinery of it.  No one has since given any machinery.  It is char- acteristic of the physical laws that they have this abstract character. The law of conservation of energy is a theorem concerning quan- tities that have to be calculated and added together, with no men- tion of the machinery, and likewise the great laws of mechanics are quantitative mathematical laws for which no machinery is available. 107 The Theory of======================================================== basic laws of physics, the conservation of energy. There is a fact, or if you wish, a  law,  governing all natural phe- nomena that are known to date. There is no known exception to this law—it is exact so far as we know. The law is called the  conser- vation of energy.  It states that there is a certain quantity, which we call energy, that does not change in the manifold changes which nature undergoes. That is a most abstract idea, because it is a math- ematical principle; it says that there is a numerical quantity which does not change when something happens. It is not a description of a mechanism, or anything concrete; it is just a strange fact that we can calculate some number and when we ﬁnish watching nature go through her tricks and calculate the number again, it is the same. (Something like the bishop on a red square, and after a number of moves—details unknown—it is still on some red square. It is a law 69 4 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:01 PM  Page 69 of this nature.) Since it is an abstract idea, we shall illustrate the meaning of it by an analogy. Imagine a child, perhaps “Dennis the Menace,” who has blocks which are absolutely indestructible, and cannot be divided into pieces. Each is the same as the other. Let us suppose that he has 28 blocks. His mother puts him with his 28 blocks into a room at the beginning of the day. At the end of the day, being curious, she counts the blocks very carefully, and discovers a phenomenal law— no matter what he does with the blocks, there are always 28 re- maining! This continues for a number of days, until one day there are only 27 blocks, but a little investigating shows that there is one under the rug—she must look everywhere to be sure that the num- ber of blocks has not changed. One day, however, the number ap- pears to change—there are only 26 blocks. Careful investigation indicates that the window was open, and upon looking outside, the other two blocks are found. Another day, careful count indicates that there are 30 blocks! This causes considerable consternation, until it is realized that Bruce came to visit, bringing his blocks with him, and he left a few at Dennis’s house. After she has disposed of the extra blocks, she closes the window, does not let Bruce in, and then everything is going along all right, until one time she counts and ﬁnds only 25 blocks. However, there is a box in the room, a toy box, and the mother goes to open the toy box, but the boy says, “No, do not open my toy box,” and screams. Mother is not allowed to open the toy box. Being extremely curious, and somewhat in- genious, she invents a scheme! She knows that a block weighs three ounces, so she weighs the box at a time when she sees 28 blocks, and it weighs 16 ounces. The next time she wishes to check, she weighs the box again, subtracts 16 ounces, and divides by 3. She discovers the following: (4.1) number of blocksseen 3ounces (weightof box) 16ounces constant. = + - cm 70 Six Easy Pieces 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:01 PM  Page 70 There then appear to be some new deviations, but careful study indicates that the dirty water in the bathtub is changing its level. The child is throwing blocks into the water, and she cannot see them because it is so dirty, but she can ﬁnd out how many blocks are in the water by adding another term to her formula. Since the original height of the water was 6 inches and each block raises the water a quarter of an inch, this new formula would be: (4.2) constant. += number of blocksseen 3ounces (weightof box) 16ounces 1/4inch (heightof water) 6inches + - - cm 71 Conservation of Energy In the gradual increase in the complexity of her world, she ﬁnds a whole series of terms representing ways of calculating how many blocks are in places where she is not allowed to look. As a result, she ﬁnds a complex formula, a quantity which  has to be computed, which always stays the same in her situation. What is the analogy of this to the conservation of energy? The most remarkable aspect that must be abstracted from this picture is that  there are no blocks.  Take away the ﬁrst terms in (4.1) and (4.2) and we ﬁnd ourselves calculating more or less abstract things. The analogy has the following points: First, when we are calculating the energy, sometimes some of it leaves the system and goes away, or sometimes some comes in. In order to verify the conservation of energy, we must be careful that we have not put any in or taken any out. Second, the energy has a large number of  different forms, and there is a formula for each one. These are gravitational energy, kinetic energy, heat energy, elastic energy, electrical energy, chemical energy, radiant energy, nuclear energy, mass energy. If we total up the formulas for each of these contributions, it will not change ex- cept for energy going in and out. It is important to realize that in physics today, we have no knowl- edge of what energy  is.  We do not have a picture that energy comes======================================================== are many proteins, such as the proteins in muscle, the structural pro- teins which are, for example, in cartilage and hair, skin, etc., that are not themselves enzymes. However, proteins are a very charac- teristic substance of life: ﬁrst of all they make up all the enzymes, and second, they make up much of the rest of living material. Pro- teins have a very interesting and simple structure. They are a series, or chain, of different  amino acids.  There are twenty different amino acids, and they all can combine with each other to form chains in which the backbone is CO-NH, etc. Proteins are nothing but chains of various ones of these twenty amino acids. Each of the amino acids probably serves some special purpose. Some, for ex- ample, have a sulfur atom at a certain place; when two sulfur atoms are in the same protein, they form a bond, that is, they tie the chain together at two points and form a loop. Another has extra oxygen atoms which make it an acidic substance; another has a basic char- acteristic. Some of them have big groups hanging out to one side, so that they take up a lot of space. One of the amino acids, called proline, is not really an amino acid, but imino acid. There is a slight 55 The Relation of Physics to Other Sciences 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:01 PM  Page 55 difference, with the result that when proline is in the chain, there is a kink in the chain. If we wished to manufacture a particular pro- tein, we would give these instructions: put one of those sulfur hooks here; next, add something to take up space; then attach something to put a kink in the chain. In this way, we will get a complicated- looking chain, hooked together and having some complex struc- ture; this is presumably just the manner in which all the various enzymes are made. One of the great triumphs in recent times (since 1960) was at last to discover the exact spatial atomic arrangement of certain proteins, which involve some ﬁfty-six or sixty amino acids in a row. Over a thousand atoms (more nearly two thousand, if we count the hydrogen atoms) have been located in a complex pattern in two proteins. The ﬁrst was hemoglobin. One of the sad aspects of this discovery is that we cannot see anything from the pattern; we do not understand why it works the way it does. Of course, that is the next problem to be attacked. Another problem is how do the enzymes know what to be? A red-eyed ﬂy makes a red-eyed ﬂy baby, and so the information for the whole pattern of enzymes to make red pigment must be passed from one ﬂy to the next. This is done by a substance in the nucleus of the cell, not a protein, called DNA (short for deoxyribonucleic acid). This is the key substance which is passed from one cell to an- other (for instance, sperm cells consist mostly of DNA) and carries the information as to how to make the enzymes. DNA is the “blue- print.” What does the blueprint look like and how does it work? First, the blueprint must be able to reproduce itself. Secondly, it must be able to instruct the protein. Concerning the reproduction, we might think that this proceeds like cell reproduction. Cells sim- ply grow bigger and then divide in half. Must it be thus with DNA molecules, then, that they too grow bigger and divide in half? Every atom  certainly does not grow bigger and divide in half! No, it is impossible to reproduce a molecule except by some more clever way. The structure of the substance DNA was studied for a long time, ﬁrst  chemically to ﬁnd the composition, and then with x-rays 56 Six Easy Pieces 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:01 PM  Page 56 to ﬁnd the pattern in space. The result was the following remark- able discovery: The DNA molecule is a pair of chains, twisted upon each other. The backbone of each of these chains, which are analogous to the chains of proteins but chemically quite different, is a series of sugar and phosphate groups, as shown in Fig. 3-2. Now we see how the chain can contain instructions, for if we could split this chain down the middle, we would have a series BAADC . . . and every living thing could have a different series. Thus perhaps, in some way, the speciﬁc  instructions  for the man- ufacture of proteins are contained in the speciﬁc  series  of the DNA. Attached to each sugar along the line, and linking the two chains together, are certain pairs of cross-links. However, they are not all of the same kind; there are four kinds, called adenine, thymine, cy- tosine, and guanine, but let us call them  A, B, C,  and  D . The in- teresting thing is that only certain pairs can sit opposite each other, for example  A  with  B  and   C  with  D.  These pairs are put on the two chains in such a way that they “ﬁt together,” and have a strong en- ergy of interaction. However,  C  will not ﬁt with  A,  and  B  will not ﬁt with   C  ; they will only ﬁt in pairs,  A  against  B  and  C  against  D . Therefore if one is   C  , the other must be  D , etc. Whatever the letters may be in======================================================== was in the lectures—by putting in suggestions of applications of the ideas and concepts in various directions outside the main line of attack. For this reason, though, I tried very hard to make all the statements as accurate as possible, to point out in every case where the equations and ideas ﬁtted into the body of physics, and how—when they learned more—things would be modiﬁed. I also felt that for such students it is important to indicate what it is that they should—if they are sufficiently clever—be able to understand by deduction from what has been said before, and what is being put in as something new. When new ideas came in, I would try either to deduce them if they were deducible, or to explain that it was  a new idea which hadn’t any basis in terms of things they had already learned and which was not supposed to be provable—but was just added in. At the start of these lectures, I assumed that the students knew something when they came out of high school—such things as geometrical optics, simple chemistry ideas, and so on. I also didn’t see that there was any reason to make the lectures in a deﬁnite order, in the sense that I would not be allowed to mention some- thing until I was ready to discuss it in detail. There was a great deal of mention of things to come, without complete discussions. These more complete discussions would come later when the preparation became more advanced. Examples are the discussions of induc- tance, and of energy levels, which are at ﬁrst brought in in a very qualitative way and are later developed more completely. At the same time that I was aiming at the more active student, I also wanted to take care of the fellow for whom the extra ﬁreworks and side applications are merely disquieting and who cannot be ex- pected to learn most of the material in the lecture at all. For such students, I wanted there to be at least a central core or backbone of material which he  could  get. Even if he didn’t understand everything in a lecture, I hoped he wouldn’t get nervous. I didn’t expect him to understand everything, but only the central and most direct fea- xxvi Feynman’s Preface 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:00 PM  Page xxvi tures. It takes, of course, a certain intelligence on his part to see which are the central theorems and central ideas, and which are the more advanced side issues and applications which he may under- stand only in later years. In giving these lectures there was one serious difficulty: in the way the course was given, there wasn’t any feedback from the students to the lecturer to indicate how well the lectures were going over. This is indeed a very serious difficulty, and I don’t know how good the lec- tures really are. The whole thing was essentially an experiment. And if I did it again I wouldn’t do it the same way—I hope I  don’t  have to do it again! I think, though, that things worked out—so far as the physics is concerned—quite satisfactorily in the ﬁrst year. In the second year I was not so satisﬁed. In the ﬁrst part of the course, dealing with electricity and magnetism, I couldn’t think of any really unique or different way of doing it—of any way that would be particularly more exciting than the usual way of present- ing it. So I don’t think I did very much in the lectures on electricity and magnetism. At the end of the second year I had originally in- tended to go on, after the electricity and magnetism, by giving some more lectures on the properties of materials, but mainly to take up things like fundamental modes, solutions of the diffusion equation, vibrating systems, orthogonal functions, . . . developing the ﬁrst stages of what are  usually called “the mathematical methods of physics.” In retrospect, I think that if I were doing it again I would go back to that original idea. But since it was not planned that I would be giving these lectures again, it was suggested that it might be a good idea to try to give an introduction to the quantum mechanics—what you will ﬁnd in Volume III. It is perfectly clear that students who will major in physics can wait until their third year for quantum mechanics. On the other hand, the argument was made that many of the students in our course study physics as a background for their primary interest in other ﬁelds. And the usual way of dealing with quantum mechan- ics makes that subject almost unavailable for the great majority of xxvii Feynman’s Preface 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:00 PM  Page xxvii students because they have to take so long to learn it. Yet, in its real applications—especially in its more complex applications, such as in electrical engineering and chemistry—the full machinery of the differential equation approach is not actually used. So I tried to de- scribe the principles of quantum mechanics in a way which wouldn’t require that one ﬁrst know the mathematics of partial dif- ferential equations. Even for a physicist I think that is an interesting thing to try to do—to======================================================== be divided into two classes: (1) those that come through hole 1, and (2) those that come through hole 2. So our observed curve must be the sum of the effects of the electrons which come through hole 1 and the electrons which come through hole 2. Let us check this idea by experiment. First, we will make a measurement for those electrons that come through hole 1. We block off hole 2 and make our counts of the clicks from the detector. From the clicking rate, we get  P 1 . The result of the measurement is shown by the curve marked  P 1 in part (b) of Fig. 6-3. The result seems quite rea- sonable. In a similar way, we measure  P 2 , the probability distribu- tion for the electrons that come through hole 2. The result of this measurement is also drawn in the ﬁgure. The result  P 12 obtained with  both  holes open is clearly not the sum of  P 1 and  P 2 , the probabilities for each hole alone. In analogy with our water-wave experiment, we say: “There is interference.” (6.5) How can such an interference come about? Perhaps we should say: “Well, that means, presumably, that it is  not true  that the lumps go either through hole 1 or hole 2, because if they did, the proba- bilities should add. Perhaps they go in a more complicated way. They split in half and . . .” But no! They cannot, they always arrive in lumps . . . “Well, perhaps some of them go through 1, and then they go around through 2, and then around a few more times, or by some other complicated path . . . then by closing hole 2, we changed the chance that an electron that  started out  through hole 1 would ﬁnally get to the backstop . . .” But notice! There are some : . For electrons P P P 12 1 2 ! + 125 Quantum Behavior 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:01 PM  Page 125 points at which very few electrons arrive when  both  holes are open, but which receive many electrons if we close one hole, so  closing  one hole  increased  the number from the other. Notice, however, that at the center of the pattern,  P 12 is more than twice as large as  P 1 + P 2 . It is as though closing one hole  decreased  the number of electrons which come through the other hole. It seems hard to explain  both effects by proposing that the electrons travel in complicated paths. It is all quite mysterious. And the more you look at it the more mysterious it seems. Many ideas have been concocted to try to ex- plain the curve for  P 12 in terms of individual electrons going around in complicated ways through the holes. None of them has suc- ceeded. None of them can get the right curve for  P 12 in terms of  P 1 and  P 2 . Yet, surprisingly enough, the  mathematics  for relating  P 1 and  P 2 to P 12 is extremely simple. For  P 12 is just like the curve  I 12 of Fig. 6-2, and  that  was simple. What is going on at the backstop can be de- scribed by two complex numbers that we can  call and  (they are functions of  x , of course). The absolute square of  gives the effect with only hole 1 open. That is,  P 1 =  . The effect with only hole 2 open is given by  in the same way. That is,  P 2 =   . And the combined effect of the two holes is just  P 12 = . The  mathematics  is the same as what we had for the water waves! (It is hard to see how one could get such a simple result from a complicated game of electrons going back and forth through the plate on some strange trajectory.) We conclude the following: The electrons arrive in lumps, like particles, and the probability of arrival of these lumps is distributed like the distribution of intensity of a wave. It is in this sense that an electron behaves “sometimes like a particle and sometimes like a wave.” Incidentally, when we were dealing with classical waves we de- ﬁned the intensity as the mean over time of the square of the wave amplitude, and we used complex numbers as a mathematical trick to simplify the analysis. But in quantum mechanics it turns out that the amplitudes  must  be represented by complex numbers. The 1 z t 2 z t 1 z t 2 z t || 1 2 z t || 1 2 z t || 1 2 zz + tt 126 Six Easy Pieces 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:01 PM  Page 126 real parts alone will not do. That is a technical point, for the mo- ment, because the formulas look just the same. Since the probability of arrival through both holes is given so simply, although it is not equal to ( P 1 + P 2 ), that is really all there is to say. But there are a large number of subtleties involved in the fact that nature does work this way. We would like to illustrate some of these subtleties for you now. First, since the number that arrives at a particular point is  not  equal to the number that arrives through 1 plus the number that arrives through 2, as we would have concluded from Proposition A, undoubtedly we should con- clude that  Proposition A is false.  It is  not  true that the electrons go either  through hole 1 or hole 2. But that conclusion can be tested by another experiment. Watching the electrons We shall now try the following experiment. To our======================================================== and pull it out and let go, then the pendulum will swing almost in a plane, but not quite. Slowly the plane keeps changing in Stockholm, but not in Quito. The blinds are down, 35 Basic Physics 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:01 PM  Page 35 too. The fact that this happened does not bring on the destruction of science. What  is  the fundamental hypothesis of science, the fundamental philosophy? We stated it in the ﬁrst chapter:  the sole test of the validity of any idea is experiment.  If it turns out that most experiments work out the same in Quito as they do in Stockholm, then those “most experiments” will be used to formulate some general law, and those experiments which do not come out the same we will say were a result of the environment near Stockholm. We will invent some way to summarize the results of the experi- ment, and we do not have to be told ahead of time what this way will look like. If we are told that the same experiment will always produce the same result, that is all very well, but if when we try it, it does  not,  then it does  not.  We just have to take what we see, and then formulate all the rest of our ideas in terms of our actual experience. Returning again to quantum mechanics and fundamental physics, we cannot go into details of the quantum-mechanical principles at this time, of course, because these are rather difficult to understand. We shall assume that they are there, and go on to describe what some of the consequences are. One of the conse- quences is that things which we used to consider as waves also behave like particles, and particles behave like waves; in fact everything behaves the same way. There is no distinction between a wave and a particle. So quantum mechanics  uniﬁes  the idea of the ﬁeld and its waves, and the particles, all into one. Now it is true that when the frequency is low, the ﬁeld aspect of the phe- nomenon is more evident, or more useful as an approximate de- scription in terms of everyday experiences. But as the frequency increases, the particle aspects of the phenomenon become more evident with the equipment with which we usually make the mea- surements. In fact, although we mentioned many frequencies, no phenomenon directly involving a frequency has yet been detected above approximately 10 12 cycles per second. We only  deduce  the higher frequencies from the energy of the particles, by a rule 36 Six Easy Pieces 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:01 PM  Page 36 which assumes that the particle-wave idea of quantum mechanics is valid. Thus we have a new view of electromagnetic interaction. We have a new kind of  particle  to add to the electron, the proton, and the neutron. That new particle is called a  photon.  The new view of the interaction of electrons and photons that is electromagnetic theory, but with everything quantum-mechanically correct, is called quantum electrodynamics.  This fundamental theory of the interac- tion of light and matter, or electric ﬁeld and charges, is our greatest success so far in physics. In this one theory we have the basic rules for all ordinary phenomena except for gravitation and nuclear pro- cesses. For example, out of quantum electrodynamics come all known electrical, mechanical, and chemical laws: the laws for the collision of billiard balls, the motions of wires in magnetic ﬁelds, the speciﬁc heat of carbon monoxide, the color of neon signs, the density of salt, and the reactions of hydrogen and oxygen to make water are all consequences of this one law. All these details can be worked out if the situation is simple enough for us to make an ap- proximation, which is almost never, but often we can understand more or less what is happening. At the present time no exceptions are found to the quantum-electrodynamic laws outside the nucleus, and there we do not know whether there is an exception because we simply do not know what is going on in the nucleus. In principle, then, quantum electrodynamics is the theory of all chemistry, and of life, if life is ultimately reduced to chemistry and therefore just to physics because chemistry is already reduced (the part of physics which is involved in chemistry being already known). Furthermore, the same quantum electrodynamics, this great thing, predicts a lot of new things. In the ﬁrst place, it tells the properties of very high-energy photons, gamma rays, etc. It predicted another very remarkable thing: besides the electron, there should be another particle of the same mass, but of opposite charge, called a  positron,  and these two, coming together, could annihilate each other with the emission of light or gamma rays. 37 Basic Physics 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:01 PM  Page 37 (After all, light and gamma rays are all the same; they are just dif- ferent points on a frequency scale.) The generalization of this, that for each particle there is an antiparticle, turns out to be true. In the case of electrons, the antiparticle has another name—it is======================================================== ultimately, not understood. It is understood that if something is pushing something else, it snaps and will slide—that is all right. But what pushes, and why? The theory is that there are currents inside the earth—circulating currents, due to the difference in temperature inside and outside—which, in their motion, push the surface slightly. Thus if there are two op- posite circulations next to each other, the matter will collect in 62 Six Easy Pieces 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:01 PM  Page 62 the region where they meet and make belts of mountains which are in unhappy stressed conditions, and so produce volcanoes and earthquakes. What about the inside of the earth? A great deal is known about the speed of earthquake waves through the earth and the density of distribution of the earth. However, physicists have been unable to get a good theory as to how dense a substance should be at the pressures that would be expected at the center of the earth. In other words, we cannot ﬁgure out the properties of matter very well in these circumstances. We do much less well with the earth than we do with the conditions of matter in the stars. The math- ematics involved seems a little too difficult, so far, but perhaps it will not be too long before someone realizes that it is an important problem, and really works it out. The other aspect, of course, is that even if we did know the density, we cannot ﬁgure out the cir- culating currents. Nor can we really work out the properties of rocks at high pressure. We cannot tell how fast the rocks should “give”; that must all be worked out by experiment. Psychology Next, we consider the science of  psychology.  Incidentally, psycho- analysis is not a science: it is at best a medical process, and perhaps even more like witch-doctoring. It has a theory as to what causes disease—lots of different “spirits,” etc. The witch doctor has a theory that a disease like malaria is caused by a spirit which comes into the air; it is not cured by shaking a snake over it, but quinine does help malaria. So, if you are sick, I would advise that you go to the witch doctor because he is the man in the tribe who knows the most about the disease; on the other hand, his knowledge is not science. Psychoanalysis has not been checked carefully by ex- periment, and there is no way to ﬁnd a list of the number of cases in which it works, the number of cases in which it does not work, etc. 63 The Relation of Physics to Other Sciences 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:01 PM  Page 63 The other branches of psychology, which involve things like the physiology of sensation—what happens in the eye, and what hap- pens in the brain—are, if you wish, less interesting. But some small but real progress has been made in studying them. One of the most interesting technical problems may or may not be called psychol- ogy. The central problem of the mind, if you will, or the nervous system, is this: when an animal learns something, it can do some- thing different than it could before, and its brain cell must have changed too, if it is made out of atoms.  In what way is it different? We do not know where to look, or what to look for, when some- thing is memorized. We do not know what it means, or what change there is in the nervous system, when a fact is learned. This is a very important problem which has not been solved at all. As- suming, however, that there is some kind of memory thing, the brain is such an enormous mass of interconnecting wires and nerves that it probably cannot be analyzed in a straightforward manner. There is an analog of this to computing machines and computing elements, in that they also have a lot of lines, and they have some kind of element, analogous, perhaps, to the synapse, or connection of one nerve to another. This is a very interesting subject which we have not the time to discuss further—the relationship between thinking and computing machines. It must be appreciated, of course, that this subject will tell us very little about the real com- plexities of ordinary human behavior. All human beings are so dif- ferent. It will be a long time before we get there. We must start much further back. If we could even ﬁgure out how a  dog  works, we would have gone pretty far. Dogs are easier to understand, but nobody yet knows how dogs work. How did it get that way? In order for physics to be useful to other sciences in a  theoretical way, other than in the invention of instruments, the science in question must supply to the physicist a description of the object in 64 Six Easy Pieces 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:01 PM  Page 64 a physicist’s language. They can say “why does a frog jump?,” and the physicist cannot answer. If they tell him what a frog is, that there are so many molecules, there is a nerve here, etc., that is dif- ferent. If they will tell us, more or less, what the earth or the stars are like, then we can ﬁgure it out.

That is, the effect falls off more slowly than the inverse square. Here is an analogy: If we are in a pool of water and there is a ﬂoating cork very close by, we can move it “directly” by pushing the water with another cork. If you looked only at the two  corks, all you would see would be that one moved immediately in re- sponse to the motion of the other—there is some kind of  “interac- tion”  between them. Of course, what we really do is to disturb the water;  the  water  then disturbs the other cork. We could make up a “law” that if you pushed the water a little bit, an object close by in the water would move. If it were farther away, of course, the second cork would scarcely move, for we move the water  locally.  On the other hand, if we jiggle the cork a new phenomenon is involved, in which the motion of the water moves the water there, etc., and waves  travel away, so that by jiggling, there is an inﬂuence  very much farther out,  an oscillatory inﬂuence, that cannot be understood from the direct interaction. Therefore the idea of direct interaction must be replaced with the existence of the water, or in the electrical case, with what we call the  electromagnetic ﬁeld. The electromagnetic ﬁeld can carry waves; some of these waves are  light,  others are used in  radio broadcasts,  but the general name is  electromagnetic waves.  These oscillatory waves can have various frequencies.  The only thing that is really different from one wave to another is the  frequency of oscillation.  If we shake a charge back and forth more and more rapidly, and look at the effects, we get a whole series of different kinds of effects, which are all uniﬁed by specifying but one number, the number of oscillations per second. The usual “pickup” that we get from electric currents in the circuits in the walls of a building has a frequency of about one hundred cycles per 31 Basic Physics 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:01 PM  Page 31 second. If we increase the frequency to 500 or 1000 kilocycles (1 kilocycle = 1000 cycles) per second, we are “on the air,” for this is the frequency range which is used for radio broadcasts. (Of course it has nothing to do with the  air!  We can have radio broadcasts without any air.) If we again increase the frequency, we come into the range that is used for FM and TV. Going still further, we use certain short waves, for example for  radar.  Still higher, and we do not need an instrument to “see” the stuff, we can see it with the human eye. In the range of frequency from 5  ¥ 10 14 to 10 15 cycles per second our eyes would see the oscillation of the charged comb, if we could shake it that fast, as red, blue, or violet light, depending on the frequency. Frequencies below this range are called infrared, and above it, ultraviolet. The fact that we can see in a particular frequency range makes that part of the electromagnetic spectrum no more impressive than the other parts from a physicist’s stand- point, but from a human standpoint, of course, it  is  more interest- ing. If we go up even higher in frequency, we get x-rays. X-rays are nothing but very high-frequency light. If we go still higher, we get gamma rays. These two terms, x-rays and gamma rays, are used al- 32 Six Easy Pieces Table 2-1 The Electromagnetic Spectrum. 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:01 PM  Page 32 most synonymously. Usually electromagnetic rays coming from nu- clei are called gamma rays, while those of high energy from atoms are called x-rays, but at the same frequency they are indistinguishable physically, no matter what their source. If we go to still higher fre- quencies, say to 10 24 cycles per second, we ﬁnd that we can make those waves artiﬁcially, for example with the synchrotron here at Caltech. We can ﬁnd electromagnetic waves with stupendously high frequencies—with even a thousand times more rapid oscillation— in the waves found in  cosmic rays.  These waves cannot be controlled by us. Quantum physics Having described the idea of the electromagnetic ﬁeld, and that this ﬁeld can carry waves, we soon learn that these waves actually behave in a strange way which seems very unwavelike. At higher frequencies they behave much more like  particles!  It is  quantum me- chanics,  discovered just after 1920, which explains this strange be- havior. In the years before 1920, the picture of space as a three-dimensional space, and of time as a separate thing, was changed by Einstein, ﬁrst into a combination which we call space- time, and then still further into a  curved  space-time to represent gravitation. So the “stage” is changed into space-time, and gravita- tion is presumably a modiﬁcation of space-time. Then it was also found that the rules for the motions of particles were incorrect. The mechanical rules of “inertia” and “forces” are  wrong —Newton’s laws are  wrong —in the world of atoms. Instead, it was discovered that things on a small scale behave======================================================== Feynman himself holds the considerable distinction of being one of the few scientists in history to discover a new law of physics, pertaining to the way that a weak nuclear force affects the behavior of certain subatomic particles. xiv Introduction 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:00 PM  Page xiv High-energy particle physics was the jewel in the crown of post- war science, at once awesome and glamorous, with its huge accel- erator machines and seemingly unending list of newly discovered subatomic particles. Feynman’s research was directed mostly toward making sense of the results of this enterprise. A great unifying theme among particle physicists has been the role of symmetry and conservation laws in bringing order to the subatomic zoo. As it happens, many of the symmetries known to particle physi- cists were familiar already in classical physics. Chief among these are the symmetries that arise from the homogeneity of space and time. Take time: apart from cosmology, where the big bang marked the beginning of time, there is nothing in physics to distinguish one moment of time from the next. Physicists say that the world is “invariant under time translations,” meaning that whether you take midnight or midday to be the zero of time in your measurements, it makes no difference to the description of physical phenomena. Physical processes do not depend on an absolute zero of time. It turns out that this symmetry under time translation directly implies one of the most basic, and also most useful, laws of physics: the law of conservation of energy. This law says that you can move en- ergy around and change its form but you can’t create or destroy it. Feynman makes this law crystal clear with his amusing story of Dennis the Menace who is always mischievously hiding his toy building blocks from his mother (Chapter Four). The most challenging lecture in this volume is the last, which is an exposition on quantum physics. It is no exaggeration to say that quantum mechanics had dominated twentieth-century physics and is far and away the most successful scientiﬁc theory in existence. It is indispensable for understanding subatomic particles, atoms and nuclei, molecules and chemical bonding, the structure of solids, su- perconductors and superﬂuids, the electrical and thermal conduc- tivity of metals and semiconductors, the structure of stars, and much else. It has practical applications ranging from the laser to the microchip. All this from a theory that at ﬁrst sight—and second sight—looks absolutely crazy! Niels Bohr, one of the founders of xv Introduction 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:00 PM  Page xv quantum mechanics, once remarked that anybody who is not shocked by the theory hasn’t understood it. The problem is that quantum ideas strike at the very heart of what we might call commonsense reality. In particular, the idea that physical objects such as electrons or atoms enjoy an independent existence, with a complete set of physical properties at all times, is called into question. For example, an electron cannot have a posi- tion in space and a well-deﬁned speed at the same moment. If you look for where an electron is located, you will ﬁnd it at a place, and if you measure its speed you will obtain a deﬁnite answer, but you cannot make both observations at once. Nor is it meaningful to at- tribute deﬁnite yet unknown values for the position and speed to an electron in the absence of a complete set of observations. This indeterminism in the very nature of atomic particles is en- capsulated by Heisenberg’s celebrated uncertainty principle. This puts strict limits on the precision with which properties such as po- sition and speed can be simultaneously known. A sharp value for position smears the range of possible values of speed and vice versa. Quantum fuzziness shows up in the way electrons, photons, and other particles move. Certain experiments can reveal them taking deﬁnite paths through space, after the fashion of bullets following trajectories toward a target. But other experimental arrangements reveal that these entities can also behave like waves, showing char- acteristic patterns of diffraction and interference. Feynman’s masterly analysis of the famous “two-slit” experiment, which teases out the “shocking” wave-particle duality in its starkest form, has become a classic in the history of scientiﬁc exposition. With a few very simple ideas, Feynman manages to take the reader to the very heart of the quantum mystery, and leaves us dazzled by the paradoxical nature of reality that it exposes. Although quantum mechanics had made the textbooks by the early 1930s, it is typical of Feynman that, as a young man, he pre- ferred to refashion the theory for himself in an entirely new guise. The Feynman method has the virtue that it provides us with a vivid picture of nature’s quantum trickery at work. The idea is that the xvi Introduction 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:00 PM  Page xvi path of a======================================================== called a positron, but for most other particles, it is called anti-so-and-so, like antiproton or antineutron. In quantum electrodynamics,  two numbers  are put in and most of the other numbers in the world are supposed to come out. The two numbers that are put in are called the mass of the electron and the charge of the electron. Ac- tually, that is not quite true, for we have a whole set of numbers for chemistry which tells how heavy the nuclei are. That leads us to the next part. Nuclei and particles What are the nuclei made of, and how are they held together? It is found that the nuclei are held together by enormous forces. When these are released, the energy released is tremendous compared with chemical energy, in the same ratio as the atomic bomb explosion is to a TNT explosion, because, of course, the atomic bomb has to do with changes inside the nucleus, while the explosion of TNT has to do with the changes of the electrons on the outside of the atoms. The question is, what are the forces which hold the protons and neutrons together in the nucleus? Just as the electrical interac- tion can be connected to a particle, a photon, Yukawa suggested that the forces between neutrons and protons also have a ﬁeld of some kind, and that when this ﬁeld jiggles it behaves like a particle. Thus there could be some other particles in the world besides pro- tons and neutrons, and he was able to deduce the properties of these particles from the already known characteristics of nuclear forces. For example, he predicted they should have a mass of two or three hundred times that of an electron; and lo and behold, in cosmic rays there was discovered a particle of the right mass! But it later turned out to be the wrong particle. It was called a  μ -meson, or muon. 38 Six Easy Pieces 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:01 PM  Page 38 However, a little while later, in 1947 or 1948, another particle was found, the  π -meson, or pion, which satisﬁed Yukawa’s criterion. Besides the proton and the neutron, then, in order to get nuclear forces we must add the pion. Now, you say, “Oh great!, with this theory we make quantum nucleodynamics using the pions just like Yukawa wanted to do, and see if it works, and everything will be explained.” Bad luck. It turns out that the calculations that are in- volved in this theory are so difficult that no one has ever been able to ﬁgure out what the consequences of the theory are, or to check it against experiment, and this has been going on now for almost twenty years! So we are stuck with a theory, and we do not know whether it is right or wrong, but we do know that it is a  little  wrong, or at least incomplete. While we have been dawdling around theoretically, trying to calculate the consequences of this theory, the experimen- talists have been discovering some things. For example, they had already discovered this  m -meson or muon, and we do not yet know where it ﬁts. Also, in cosmic rays, a large number of other “extra” particles were found. It turns out that today we have approximately thirty particles, and it is very difficult to understand the relation- ships of all these particles, and what nature wants them for, or what the connections are from one to another. We do not today under- stand these various particles as different aspects of the same thing, and the fact that we have so many unconnected particles is a rep- resentation of the fact that we have so much unconnected infor- mation without a good theory. After the great successes of quantum electrodynamics, there is a certain amount of knowledge of nuclear physics which is rough knowledge, sort of half experience and half theory, assuming a type of force between protons and neutrons and seeing what will happen, but not really understanding where the force comes from. Aside from that, we have made very little progress. We have collected an enormous number of chemical ele- ments. In the chemical case, there suddenly appeared a relationship among these elements which was unexpected, and which is embod- ied in the periodic table of Mendeléev. For example, sodium and 39 Basic Physics 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:01 PM  Page 39 potassium are about the same in their chemical properties and are found in the same column in the Mendeléev chart. We have been seeking a Mendeléev-type chart for the new particles. One such chart of the new particles was made independently by Gell-Mann in the USA and Nishijima in Japan. The basis of their classiﬁcation is a new number, like the electric charge, which can be assigned to each particle, called its “strangeness,”  S.  This number is conserved, like the electric charge, in reactions which take place by nuclear forces. In Table 2-2 are listed all the particles. We cannot discuss them much at this stage, but the table will at least show you how much we do not know. Underneath each particle its mass is given in a cer- tain unit, called the Mev. One Mev is equal to 1.782  ¥ 10 –27 gram.======================================================== be divided into two classes: (1) those that come through hole 1, and (2) those that come through hole 2. So our observed curve must be the sum of the effects of the electrons which come through hole 1 and the electrons which come through hole 2. Let us check this idea by experiment. First, we will make a measurement for those electrons that come through hole 1. We block off hole 2 and make our counts of the clicks from the detector. From the clicking rate, we get  P 1 . The result of the measurement is shown by the curve marked  P 1 in part (b) of Fig. 6-3. The result seems quite rea- sonable. In a similar way, we measure  P 2 , the probability distribu- tion for the electrons that come through hole 2. The result of this measurement is also drawn in the ﬁgure. The result  P 12 obtained with  both  holes open is clearly not the sum of  P 1 and  P 2 , the probabilities for each hole alone. In analogy with our water-wave experiment, we say: “There is interference.” (6.5) How can such an interference come about? Perhaps we should say: “Well, that means, presumably, that it is  not true  that the lumps go either through hole 1 or hole 2, because if they did, the proba- bilities should add. Perhaps they go in a more complicated way. They split in half and . . .” But no! They cannot, they always arrive in lumps . . . “Well, perhaps some of them go through 1, and then they go around through 2, and then around a few more times, or by some other complicated path . . . then by closing hole 2, we changed the chance that an electron that  started out  through hole 1 would ﬁnally get to the backstop . . .” But notice! There are some : . For electrons P P P 12 1 2 ! + 125 Quantum Behavior 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:01 PM  Page 125 points at which very few electrons arrive when  both  holes are open, but which receive many electrons if we close one hole, so  closing  one hole  increased  the number from the other. Notice, however, that at the center of the pattern,  P 12 is more than twice as large as  P 1 + P 2 . It is as though closing one hole  decreased  the number of electrons which come through the other hole. It seems hard to explain  both effects by proposing that the electrons travel in complicated paths. It is all quite mysterious. And the more you look at it the more mysterious it seems. Many ideas have been concocted to try to ex- plain the curve for  P 12 in terms of individual electrons going around in complicated ways through the holes. None of them has suc- ceeded. None of them can get the right curve for  P 12 in terms of  P 1 and  P 2 . Yet, surprisingly enough, the  mathematics  for relating  P 1 and  P 2 to P 12 is extremely simple. For  P 12 is just like the curve  I 12 of Fig. 6-2, and  that  was simple. What is going on at the backstop can be de- scribed by two complex numbers that we can  call and  (they are functions of  x , of course). The absolute square of  gives the effect with only hole 1 open. That is,  P 1 =  . The effect with only hole 2 open is given by  in the same way. That is,  P 2 =   . And the combined effect of the two holes is just  P 12 = . The  mathematics  is the same as what we had for the water waves! (It is hard to see how one could get such a simple result from a complicated game of electrons going back and forth through the plate on some strange trajectory.) We conclude the following: The electrons arrive in lumps, like particles, and the probability of arrival of these lumps is distributed like the distribution of intensity of a wave. It is in this sense that an electron behaves “sometimes like a particle and sometimes like a wave.” Incidentally, when we were dealing with classical waves we de- ﬁned the intensity as the mean over time of the square of the wave amplitude, and we used complex numbers as a mathematical trick to simplify the analysis. But in quantum mechanics it turns out that the amplitudes  must  be represented by complex numbers. The 1 z t 2 z t 1 z t 2 z t || 1 2 z t || 1 2 z t || 1 2 zz + tt 126 Six Easy Pieces 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:01 PM  Page 126 real parts alone will not do. That is a technical point, for the mo- ment, because the formulas look just the same. Since the probability of arrival through both holes is given so simply, although it is not equal to ( P 1 + P 2 ), that is really all there is to say. But there are a large number of subtleties involved in the fact that nature does work this way. We would like to illustrate some of these subtleties for you now. First, since the number that arrives at a particular point is  not  equal to the number that arrives through 1 plus the number that arrives through 2, as we would have concluded from Proposition A, undoubtedly we should con- clude that  Proposition A is false.  It is  not  true that the electrons go either  through hole 1 or hole 2. But that conclusion can be tested by another experiment. Watching the electrons We shall now try the following experiment. To our======================================================== applause. For many years after the lectures that make up this book were given, Feynman was an occasional guest lecturer for Caltech’s fresh- man physics course. Naturally, his appearances had to be kept secret so there would be room left in the hall for the registered students. At one such lecture the subject was curved-space time, and Feyn- man was characteristically brilliant. But the unforgettable moment came at the beginning of the lecture. The supernova of 1987 had just been discovered, and Feynman was very excited about it. He said, “Tycho Brahe had his supernova, and Kepler had his. Then there weren’t any for 400 years. But now I have mine.” The class fell silent, and Feynman continued on. “There are 10 11 stars in the galaxy. That used to be a  huge  number. But it’s only a hundred bil- lion. It’s less than the national deﬁcit! We used to call them astro- nomical numbers. Now we should call them economical numbers.” The class dissolved in laughter, and Feynman, having captured his audience, went on with his lecture. Showmanship aside, Feynman’s pedagogical technique was simple. A summation of his teaching philosophy was found among his papers in the Caltech archives, in a note he had scribbled to himself while in Brazil in 1952: First ﬁgure out why you want the students to learn the subject and what you want them to know, and the method will result more or less by common sense. What came to Feynman by “common sense” were often brilliant twists that perfectly captured the essence of his point. Once, during xx Special Preface 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:00 PM  Page xx a public lecture, he was trying to explain why one must not verify an idea using the same data that suggested the idea in the ﬁrst place. Seeming to wander off the subject, Feynman began talking about license plates. “You know, the most amazing thing happened to me tonight. I was coming here, on the way to the lecture, and I came in through the parking lot. And you won’t believe what happened. I saw a car with the license plate ARW 357. Can you imagine? Of all the millions of license plates in the state, what was the chance that I would see that particular one tonight? Amazing!” A point that even many scientists fail to grasp was made clear through Feyn- man’s remarkable “common sense.” In 35 years at Caltech (from 1952 to 1987), Feynman was listed as teacher of record for 34 courses. Twenty-ﬁve of them were ad- vanced graduate courses, strictly limited to graduate students, un- less undergraduates asked permission to take them (they often did, and permission was nearly always granted). The rest were mainly introductory graduate courses. Only once did Feynman teach courses purely for undergraduates, and that was the celebrated oc- casion in the academic years 1961 to 1962 and 1962 to 1963, with a brief reprise in 1964, when he gave the lectures that were to be- come  The Feynman Lectures on Physics . At the time there was a consensus at Caltech that freshman and sophomore students were getting turned off rather than spurred on by their two years of compulsory physics. To remedy the situation, Feynman was asked to design a series of lectures to be given to the students over the course of two years, ﬁrst to freshmen, and then to the same class as sophomores. When he agreed, it was immedi- ately decided that the lectures should be transcribed for publication. That job turned out to be far more difficult than anyone had imag- ined. Turning out publishable books required a tremendous amount of work on the part of his colleagues, as well as Feynman himself, who did the ﬁnal editing of every chapter. And the nuts and bolts of running a course had to be addressed. This task was greatly complicated by the fact that Feynman had only a vague outline of what he wanted to cover. This meant that xxi Special Preface 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:00 PM  Page xxi no one knew what Feynman would say until he stood in front of a lecture hall ﬁlled with students and said it. The Caltech professors who assisted him would then scramble as best they could to handle mundane details, such as making up homework problems. Why did Feynman devote more than two years to revolutionize the way beginning physics was taught? One can only speculate, but there were probably three basic reasons. One is that he loved to have an audience, and this gave him a bigger theater than he usually had in graduate courses. The second was that he genuinely cared about students, and he simply thought that teaching freshmen was an important thing to do. The third and perhaps most important reason was the sheer challenge of reformulating physics, as he un- derstood it, so that it could be presented to young students. This was his specialty, and was the standard by which he measured whether something was really understood. Feynman was once asked by a Caltech faculty member to explain why spin 1/2 particles obey Fermi-Dirac statistics. He gauged his audience perfectly======================================================== that all reversible machines must lift to  exactly the same height.  Suppose that  B  was really reversible also. The argu- ment that  Y is not higher than  X  is, of course, just as good as it was before, but we can also make our argument the other way around, using the machines in the opposite order, and prove that  X is not higher than Y.  This, then, is a very remarkable observation because it permits us to analyze the height to which different machines are going to lift something  without looking at the interior mechanism. We know at once that if somebody makes an enormously elaborate series of levers that lift three units a certain distance by lowering one unit by one unit distance, and we compare it with a simple lever which does the same thing and is fundamentally reversible, his machine will lift it no higher, but perhaps less high. If his ma- chine is reversible, we also know exactly  how  high it will lift. To summarize: every reversible machine, no matter how it operates, which drops one pound one foot and lifts a three-pound weight al- ways lifts it the same distance,  X.  This is clearly a universal law of great utility. The next question is, of course, what is  X? Suppose we have a reversible machine which is going to lift this distance  X,  three for one. We set up three balls in a rack which does not move, as shown in Fig. 4-2. One ball is held on a stage at a dis- tance one foot above the ground. The machine can lift three balls, lowering one by a distance 1. Now, we have arranged that the plat- form which holds three balls has a ﬂoor and two shelves, exactly spaced at distance  X,  and further, that the rack which holds the balls is spaced at distance  X,  (a). First we roll the balls horizontally 74 Six Easy Pieces 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:01 PM  Page 74 from the rack to the shelves, (b), and we suppose that this takes no energy because we  do not change the height. The reversible machine then operates: it lowers the single ball to the ﬂoor, and it lifts the rack a distance  X,  (c). Now we have ingeniously arranged the rack so that these balls are again even with the platforms. Thus we unload the balls onto the rack, (d); having unloaded the balls, we can restore the machine to its original condition. Now we have three balls on the upper three shelves and one at the bottom. But the strange thing is that, in a certain way of speaking, we have not lifted  two  of them at all because, after all, there were balls on shelves 2 and 3 before. The resulting effect  has been to lift  one ball  a distance 3 X . Now, if 3 X exceeds one foot, then we can  lower  the ball to return the machine to the initial condition, (f), and we can run the apparatus again. Therefore 3 X  cannot exceed one foot, for if 3 X exceeds one foot we can make perpetual motion. Likewise, we can prove that  one foot cannot exceed  3 X,  by making the whole machine run the opposite 75 Conservation of Energy Figure 4-2 A reversible machine. 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:01 PM  Page 75 way, since it is a reversible machine. Therefore 3 X is neither  greater nor less than a foot,  and we discover then, by argument alone, the law that  X =  1 / 3 foot. The generalization is clear: one pound falls a certain distance in operating a reversible machine; then the ma- chine can lift  p  pounds this distance divided by  p.  Another way of putting the result is that three pounds times the height lifted, which in our problem was  X , is equal to one pound times the distance lowered, which is one foot in this case. If we take all the weights and multiply them by the heights at which they are now, above the ﬂoor, let the machine operate, and then multiply all the weights by all the heights again,  there will be no change.  (We have to generalize the example where we moved only one weight to the case where when we lower one, we lift several different ones—but that is easy.) We call the sum of the weights times the heights  gravitational potential energy —the energy which an object has because of its re- lationship in space, relative to the earth. The formula for gravita- tional energy, then, so long as we are not too far from the earth (the force weakens as we go higher) is . (4.3) It is a very beautiful line of reasoning. The only problem is that perhaps it is not true. (After all, nature does not  have  to go along with our reasoning.) For example, perhaps perpetual motion is, in fact, possible. Some of the assumptions may be wrong, or we may have made a mistake in reasoning, so it is always necessary to check. It turns out experimentally,  in fact, to be true. The general name of energy which has to do with location rela- tive to something else is called  potential  energy. In this particular case, of course, we call it  gravitational potential energy.  If it is a ques- tion of electrical forces against which we are working, instead of gravitational forces, if we are “lifting” charges away from other charges with======================================================== with the forms actually exhibited by crystals as they occur in nature. The angles between the various “faces” of a crystal agree, within seconds of arc, with angles deduced on the assump- tion that a crystal is made of many “layers” of atoms. Everything is made of atoms.  That is the key hypothesis. The most important hypothesis in all of biology, for example, is that  every- thing that animals do, atoms do.  In other words,  there is nothing that living things do that cannot be understood from the point of view that they are made of atoms acting according to the laws of physics.  This was not known from the beginning: it took some experimenting and theorizing to suggest this hypothesis, but now it is accepted, and it is the most useful theory for producing new ideas in the ﬁeld of biology. If a piece of steel or a piece of salt, consisting of atoms one next to the other, can have such interesting properties; if water—which is nothing but these little blobs, mile upon mile of the same thing over the earth—can form waves and foam, and make rushing noises and strange patterns as it runs over cement; if all of this, all the life of a stream of water, can be nothing but a pile of atoms,  how much more is possible ? If instead of arranging the atoms in some deﬁnite pattern, again and again repeated, on and on, or even forming little lumps of complexity like the odor of violets, we make an arrange- ment which is  always different  from place to place, with different kinds of atoms arranged in many ways, continually changing, not repeating, how much more marvelously is it possible that this thing might behave? Is it possible that that “thing” walking back and forth in front of you, talking to you, is a great glob of these atoms 20 Six Easy Pieces 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:01 PM  Page 20 in a very complex arrangement, such that the sheer complexity of it staggers the imagination as to what it can do? When we say we are a pile of atoms, we do not mean we are  merely  a pile of atoms, because a pile of atoms which is not repeated from one to the other might well have the possibilities which you see before you in the mirror. 21 Atoms in Motion 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:01 PM  Page 21 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:01 PM  Page 22 BASIC PHYSICS Introduction In this chapter, we shall examine the most fundamental ideas that we have about physics—the nature of things as we see them at the present time. We shall not discuss the history of how we know that all these ideas are true; you will learn these details in due time. The things with which we concern ourselves in science appear in myriad forms, and with a multitude of attributes. For example, if we stand on the shore and look at the sea, we see the water, the waves breaking, the foam, the sloshing motion of the water, the sound, the air, the winds and the clouds, the sun and the blue sky, and light; there is sand and there are rocks of various hardness and permanence, color and texture. There are animals and seaweed, hunger and disease, and the observer on the beach; there may be even happiness and thought. Any other spot in nature has a similar variety of things and inﬂuences. It is always as complicated as that, no matter where it is. Curiosity demands that we ask questions, that we try to put things together and try to understand this mul- titude of aspects as perhaps resulting from the action of a relatively small number of elemental things and forces acting in an inﬁnite variety of combinations. For example: Is the sand other than the rocks? That is, is the sand perhaps nothing but a great number of very tiny stones? Is the moon a great rock? If we understood rocks, would we  also understand the 23 2 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:01 PM  Page 23 sand and the moon? Is the wind a sloshing of the air analogous to the sloshing motion of the water in the sea? What common features do different movements have? What is common to different kinds of sound? How many different colors are there? And so on. In this way we try gradually to analyze all things, to put together things which at ﬁrst sight look different, with the hope that we may be able to  reduce  the number of  different  things and thereby under- stand them better. A few hundred years ago, a method was devised to ﬁnd partial answers to such questions.  Observation, reason,  and  experiment make up what we call the  scientiﬁc method.  We shall have to limit ourselves to a bare description of our basic view of what is some- times called  fundamental physics,  or fundamental ideas which have arisen from the application of the scientiﬁc method. What do we mean by “understanding” something? We can imag- ine that this complicated array of moving things which constitutes “the world” is something like a great chess game being played by the gods, and we are observers of the game. We do not know what the rules of the game are; all we are allowed to do is to  watch  the playing.======================================================== There is no natural way to group them as “molecules of salt.” Returning to our discussion of solution and precipitation, if we increase the temperature of the salt solution, then the rate at which 14 Six Easy Pieces Figure 1-7 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:01 PM  Page 14 atoms are taken away is increased, and so is the rate at which atoms are brought back. It turns out to be very difficult, in general, to predict which way it is going to go, whether more or less of the solid will dissolve. Most substances dissolve more, but some sub- stances dissolve less, as the temperature increases. Chemical reactions In all of the processes which have been described so far, the atoms and the ions have not changed partners, but of course there are cir- cumstances in which the atoms do change combinations, forming new molecules. This is illustrated in Fig. 1-8. A process in which the rearrangement of the atomic partners occurs is what we call a chemical reaction.  The other processes so far described are called physical processes, but there is no sharp distinction between the two. (Nature does not care what we call it, she just keeps on doing it.) This ﬁgure is supposed to represent carbon burning in oxygen. In the case of oxygen,  two  oxygen atoms stick together very strongly. (Why do not  three  or even  four  stick together? That is one of the very peculiar characteristics of such atomic processes. Atoms are very special: they like certain particular partners, certain par- ticular directions, and so on. It is the job of physics to analyze why each one wants what it wants. At any rate, two oxygen atoms form, saturated and happy, a molecule.) 15 Atoms in Motion Figure 1-8 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:01 PM  Page 15 The carbon atoms are supposed to be in a solid crystal (which could be graphite or diamond*). Now, for example, one of the oxy- gen molecules can come over to the carbon, and each atom can pick up a carbon atom and go ﬂying off in a new combination— “carbon-oxygen”—which is a molecule of the gas called carbon monoxide. It is given the chemical name CO. It is very simple: the letters “CO” are practically a picture of that molecule. But carbon attracts oxygen much more than oxygen attracts oxygen or carbon attracts carbon. Therefore in this process the oxygen may arrive with only a little energy, but the oxygen and carbon will snap to- gether with a tremendous vengeance and commotion, and every- thing near them will pick up the energy. A large amount of motion energy, kinetic energy, is thus generated. This of course is  burning; we are getting  heat  from the combination of oxygen and carbon. The heat is ordinarily in the form of the molecular motion of the hot gas, but in certain circumstances it can be so enormous that it generates  light.  That is how one gets  ﬂames. In addition, the carbon monoxide is not quite satisﬁed. It is pos- sible for it to attach another oxygen, so that we might have a much more complicated reaction in which the oxygen is combining with the carbon, while at the same time there happens to be a collision with a carbon monoxide molecule. One oxygen atom could attach itself to the CO and ultimately form a molecule, composed of one carbon and two oxygens, which is designated CO 2 and called car- bon dioxide. If we burn the carbon with very little oxygen in a very rapid reaction (for example, in an automobile engine, where the explosion is so fast that there is not time for it to make carbon diox- ide) a considerable amount of carbon monoxide is formed. In many such rearrangements, a very large amount of energy is released, forming explosions, ﬂames, etc., depending on the reactions. Chemists have studied these arrangements of the atoms, and found that every substance is some type of  arrangement of atoms. 16 Six Easy Pieces *  One  can  burn a diamond in air. 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:01 PM  Page 16 To illustrate this idea, let us consider another example. If we go into a ﬁeld of small violets, we know what “that smell” is. It is some kind of  molecule,  or arrangement of atoms, that has worked its way into our noses. First of all,  how  did it work its way in? That is rather easy. If the smell is some kind of molecule in the air, jiggling around and being knocked every which way, it might have  accidentally worked its way into the nose. Certainly it has no particular desire to get into our nose. It is merely one helpless part of a jostling crowd of molecules, and in its aimless wanderings this particular chunk of matter happens to ﬁnd itself in the nose. Now chemists can take special molecules like the odor of violets, and analyze them and tell us the  exact arrangement  of the atoms in space. We know that the carbon dioxide molecule is straight and symmetrical: O—C—O. (That can be determined easily, too, by physical methods.) However, even for the vastly more complicated arrangements of atoms that there are in chemistry, one can, by a long,======================================================== with the forms actually exhibited by crystals as they occur in nature.

In quantum electrodynamics,  two numbers  are put in and most of the other numbers in the world are supposed to come out. The two numbers that are put in are called the mass of the electron and the charge of the electron. Ac- tually, that is not quite true, for we have a whole set of numbers for chemistry which tells how heavy the nuclei are. That leads us to the next part. Nuclei and particles What are the nuclei made of, and how are they held together? It is found that the nuclei are held together by enormous forces. When these are released, the energy released is tremendous compared with chemical energy, in the same ratio as the atomic bomb explosion is to a TNT explosion, because, of course, the atomic bomb has to do with changes inside the nucleus, while the explosion of TNT has to do with the changes of the electrons on the outside of the atoms. The question is, what are the forces which hold the protons and neutrons together in the nucleus? Just as the electrical interac- tion can be connected to a particle, a photon, Yukawa suggested that the forces between neutrons and protons also have a ﬁeld of some kind, and that when this ﬁeld jiggles it behaves like a particle. Thus there could be some other particles in the world besides pro- tons and neutrons, and he was able to deduce the properties of these particles from the already known characteristics of nuclear forces. For example, he predicted they should have a mass of two or three hundred times that of an electron; and lo and behold, in cosmic rays there was discovered a particle of the right mass! But it later turned out to be the wrong particle. It was called a  μ -meson, or muon. 38 Six Easy Pieces 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:01 PM  Page 38 However, a little while later, in 1947 or 1948, another particle was found, the  π -meson, or pion, which satisﬁed Yukawa’s criterion. Besides the proton and the neutron, then, in order to get nuclear forces we must add the pion. Now, you say, “Oh great!, with this theory we make quantum nucleodynamics using the pions just like Yukawa wanted to do, and see if it works, and everything will be explained.” Bad luck. It turns out that the calculations that are in- volved in this theory are so difficult that no one has ever been able to ﬁgure out what the consequences of the theory are, or to check it against experiment, and this has been going on now for almost twenty years! So we are stuck with a theory, and we do not know whether it is right or wrong, but we do know that it is a  little  wrong, or at least incomplete. While we have been dawdling around theoretically, trying to calculate the consequences of this theory, the experimen- talists have been discovering some things. For example, they had already discovered this  m -meson or muon, and we do not yet know where it ﬁts. Also, in cosmic rays, a large number of other “extra” particles were found. It turns out that today we have approximately thirty particles, and it is very difficult to understand the relation- ships of all these particles, and what nature wants them for, or what the connections are from one to another. We do not today under- stand these various particles as different aspects of the same thing, and the fact that we have so many unconnected particles is a rep- resentation of the fact that we have so much unconnected infor- mation without a good theory. After the great successes of quantum electrodynamics, there is a certain amount of knowledge of nuclear physics which is rough knowledge, sort of half experience and half theory, assuming a type of force between protons and neutrons and seeing what will happen, but not really understanding where the force comes from. Aside from that, we have made very little progress. We have collected an enormous number of chemical ele- ments. In the chemical case, there suddenly appeared a relationship among these elements which was unexpected, and which is embod- ied in the periodic table of Mendeléev. For example, sodium and 39 Basic Physics 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:01 PM  Page 39 potassium are about the same in their chemical properties and are found in the same column in the Mendeléev chart. We have been seeking a Mendeléev-type chart for the new particles. One such chart of the new particles was made independently by Gell-Mann in the USA and Nishijima in Japan. The basis of their classiﬁcation is a new number, like the electric charge, which can be assigned to each particle, called its “strangeness,”  S.  This number is conserved, like the electric charge, in reactions which take place by nuclear forces. In Table 2-2 are listed all the particles. We cannot discuss them much at this stage, but the table will at least show you how much we do not know. Underneath each particle its mass is given in a cer- tain unit, called the Mev. One Mev is equal to 1.782  ¥ 10 –27 gram.
