======================================================== Six Easy Pieces 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:01 PM  Page 112 years we have discovered that all mass is made of tiny particles and that there are several kinds of interactions, such as nuclear forces, etc. None of these nuclear or electrical forces has yet been found to explain gravitation. The quantum-mechanical aspects of nature have not yet been carried over to gravitation. When the scale is so small that we need the quantum effects, the gravitational effects are so weak that the need for a quantum theory of gravitation has not yet developed. On the other hand, for consistency in our physical theories it would be important to see whether Newton’s law mod- iﬁed to Einstein’s law can be further modiﬁed to be consistent with the uncertainty principle. This last modiﬁcation has not yet been completed. 113 The Theory of Gravitation 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:01 PM  Page 113 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:01 PM  Page 114 QUANTUM BEHAVIOR Atomic mechanics In the last few chapters we have treated the essential ideas nec- essary for an understanding of most of the important phenom- ena of light—or electromagnetic radiation in general. (We have left a few special topics for next year. Speciﬁcally, the theory of the index of dense materials and total internal reﬂection.) What we have dealt with is called the “classical theory” of electric waves, which turns out to be a completely adequate description of nature for a large number of effects. We have not had to worry yet about the fact that light energy comes in lumps or “photons.” We would like to take up as our next subject the problem of the behavior of relatively large pieces of matter—their mechanical and thermal properties, for instance. In discussing these, we will ﬁnd that the “classical” (or older) theory fails almost immediately, be- cause matter is really made up of atomic-sized particles. Still, we will deal only with the classical part, because that is the only part that we can understand using the classical mechanics we have been learning. But we shall not be very successful. We shall ﬁnd that in the case of matter, unlike the case of light, we shall be in difficulty relatively soon. We could, of course, continuously skirt away from the atomic effects, but we shall instead interpose here a short ex- cursion in which we will describe the basic ideas of the quantum properties of matter, i.e., the quantum ideas of atomic physics, so 115 6 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:01 PM  Page 115 that you will have some feeling for what it is we are leaving out. For we will have to leave out some important subjects that we can- not avoid coming close to. So we will give now the  introduction  to the subject of quantum mechanics, but will not be able actually to get into the subject until much later. “Quantum mechanics” is the description of the behavior of mat- ter in all its details and, in particular, of the happenings on an atomic scale. Things on a very small scale behave like nothing that you have any direct experience about. They do not behave like waves, they do not behave like particles, they do not behave like clouds, or billiard balls, or weights on springs, or like anything that you have ever seen. Newton thought that light was made up of particles, but then it was discovered, as we have seen here, that it behaves like a wave. Later, however (in the beginning of the twentieth century), it was found that light did indeed sometimes behave like a particle. His- torically, the electron, for example, was thought to behave like a particle, and then it was found that in many respects it behaved like a wave. So it really behaves like neither. Now we have given up. We say: “It is like  neither .” There is one lucky break, however—electrons behave just like light. The quantum behavior of atomic objects (electrons, pro- tons, neutrons, photons, and so on) is the same for all; they are all “particle waves,” or whatever you want to call them. So what we learn about the properties of electrons (which we shall use for our examples) will apply also to all “particles,” including photons of light. The gradual accumulation of information about atomic and small-scale behavior during the ﬁrst quarter of this century, which gave some indications about how small things do behave, produced an increasing confusion which was ﬁnally resolved in 1926 and 1927 by Schrödinger, Heisenberg, and Born. They ﬁnally obtained a consistent description of the behavior of matter on a small scale. We take up the main features of that description in this chapter. 116 Six Easy Pieces 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:01 PM  Page 116 Because atomic behavior is so unlike ordinary experience, it is very difficult to get used to and it appears peculiar and mysterious to everyone, both to the novice and to the experienced physicist. Even the experts do not understand it the way they would like to, and it is perfectly reasonable that they should not, because======================================================== a lot of levers, then the energy content is called  elec- gravitational potentialenergy for oneobject (weight) (height) # = fp 76 Six Easy Pieces 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:01 PM  Page 76 trical potential energy.  The general principle is that the change in the energy is the force times the distance that the force is pushed, and that this is a change in energy in general: . (4.4) We will return to many of these other kinds of energy as we con- tinue the course. The principle of the conservation of energy is very useful for de- ducing what will happen in a number of circumstances. In high school we learned a lot of laws about pulleys and levers used in dif- ferent ways. We can now see that these “laws” are  all the same thing, and that we did not have to memorize 75 rules to ﬁgure it out. A simple example is a smooth inclined plane which is, happily, a three-four-ﬁve triangle (Fig. 4-3). We hang a one-pound weight on the inclined plane with a pulley, and on the other side of the pulley, a weight  W.  We want to know how heavy  W  must be to balance the one pound on the plane. How can we ﬁgure that out? If we say it is just balanced, it is reversible and so can move up and down, and we can consider the following situation. In the initial circumstance, (a), the one-pound weight is at the bottom and weight  W  is at the top. When  W  has slipped down in a reversible way, we have a one- pound weight at the top and the weight  W the slant distance, (b), or ﬁve feet, from the plane in which it was before. We  lifted  the one- pound weight only  three  feet and we lowered  W  pounds by  ﬁve  feet. changein energy (force) distanceforce actsthrough # = cc mm 77 Conservation of Energy Figure 4-3 Inclined plane. 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:01 PM  Page 77 Therefore  W =  3 / 5 of a pound. Note that we deduced this from the  conservation of energy,  and not from force components. Clever- ness, however, is relative. It can be deduced in a way which is even more brilliant, discovered by Stevinus and inscribed on his tomb- stone. Figure 4-4 explains that it has to be  3 / 5 of a pound, because the chain does not go around. It is evident that the lower part of the chain is balanced by itself, so that the pull of the ﬁve weights on one side must balance the pull of three weights on the other, or whatever the ratio of the legs. You see, by looking at this diagram, that  W  must be  3 / 5 of a pound. (If you get an epitaph like that on your gravestone, you are doing ﬁne.) Let us now illustrate the energy principle with a more compli- cated problem, the screw jack shown in Fig. 4-5. A handle 20 inches long is used to turn the screw, which has 10 threads to the inch. We would like to know how much force would be needed at the handle to lift one ton (2000 pounds). If we want to lift the ton 1 inch, say, then we must turn the handle around ten times. When it goes around once it goes approximately 126 inches. The handle must thus travel 1260 inches, and if we used various pulleys, etc., we would be lifting our one ton with an unknown smaller weight W  applied to the end of the handle. So we ﬁnd out that  W is about 1.6 pounds. This is a result of the conservation of energy. 78 Six Easy Pieces Figure 4-4 The epitaph of Stevinus. 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:01 PM  Page 78 Take now the somewhat more complicated example shown in Fig. 4-6. A rod or bar, 8 feet long, is supported at one end. In the middle of the bar is a weight of 60 pounds, and at a distance of two feet from the support there is a weight of 100 pounds. How hard do we have to lift the end of the bar in order to keep it bal- anced, disregarding the weight of the bar? Suppose we put a pulley at one end and hang a weight on the pulley. How big would the weight  W  have to be in order for it to balance? We imagine that the weight falls any arbitrary distance—to make it easy for our- selves suppose it goes down 4 inches—how high would the two load weights rise? The center rises 2 inches, and the point a quar- ter of the way from the ﬁxed end lifts 1 inch. Therefore, the prin- ciple that the sum of the heights times the weights does not change tells us that the weight  W  times 4 inches down, plus 60 pounds times 2 inches up, plus 100 pounds times 1 inch, has to add up to nothing: (4.5) Thus we must have a 55-pound weight to balance the bar. In this way we can work out the laws of “balance”—the statics of compli- cated bridge arrangements, and so on. This approach is called the principle of virtual work,  because in order to apply this argument we had to  imagine  that the structure moves a little—even though 4 (2)(60) (1)(100) 0, 55lb.

In order to understand the chemistry, we must know exactly what atoms are present, for otherwise we cannot analyze it. That is but one limita- tion, of course. There is another  kind  of problem in the sister sciences which does not exist in physics; we might call it, for lack of a better term, the historical question. How did it get that way? If we understand all about biology, we will want to know how all the things which are on the earth got there. There is the theory of evolution, an im- portant part of biology. In geology, we not only want to know how the mountains are forming, but how the entire earth was formed in the beginning, the origin of the solar system, etc. That, of course, leads us to want to know what kind of matter there was in the world. How did the stars evolve? What were the initial conditions? That is the problem of astronomical history. A great deal has been found out about the formation of stars, the formation of elements from which we were made, and even a little about the origin of the universe. There is no historical question being studied in physics at the present time. We do not have a question, “Here are the laws of physics, how did they get that way?” We do not imagine, at the moment, that the laws of physics are somehow changing with time, that they were different in the past than they are at present. Of course they  may  be, and the moment we ﬁnd they  are,  the historical question of physics will be wrapped up with the rest of the history of the universe, and then the physicist will be talking about the same problems as astronomers, geologists, and biologists. Finally, there is a physical problem that is common to many ﬁelds, that is very old, and that has not been solved. It is not the 65 The Relation of Physics to Other Sciences 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:01 PM  Page 65 problem of ﬁnding new fundamental particles, but something left over from a long time ago—over a hundred years. Nobody in physics has really been able to analyze it mathematically satisfacto- rily in spite of its importance to the sister sciences. It is the analysis of  circulating or turbulent ﬂuids.  If we watch the evolution of a star, there comes a point where we can deduce that it is going to start convection, and thereafter we can no longer deduce what should happen. A few million years later the star explodes, but we cannot ﬁgure out the reason. We cannot analyze the weather. We do not know the patterns of motions that there should be inside the earth. The simplest form of the problem is to take a pipe that is very long and push water through it at high speed. We ask: to push a given amount of water through that pipe, how much pressure is needed? No one can analyze it from ﬁrst principles and the properties of water. If the water ﬂows very slowly, or if we use a thick goo like honey, then we can do it nicely. You will ﬁnd that in your textbook. What we really cannot do is deal with actual, wet water running through a pipe. That is the central problem which we ought to solve someday, and we have not. A poet once said, “The whole universe is in a glass of wine.” We will probably never know in what sense he meant that, for poets do not write to be understood. But it is true that if we look at a glass of wine closely enough we see the entire universe. There are the things of physics: the twisting liquid which evaporates depend- ing on the wind and weather, the reﬂections in the glass, and our imagination adds the atoms. The glass is a distillation of the earth’s rocks, and in its composition we see the secrets of the universe’s age, and the evolution of stars. What strange array of chemicals are in the wine? How did they come to be? There are the ferments, the enzymes, the substrates, and the products. There in wine is found the great generalization: all life is fermentation. Nobody can dis- cover the chemistry of wine without discovering, as did Louis Pas- teur, the cause of much disease. How vivid is the claret, pressing its existence into the consciousness that watches it! If our small 66 Six Easy Pieces 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:01 PM  Page 66 minds, for some convenience, divide this glass of wine, this uni- verse, into parts—physics, biology, geology, astronomy, psychology, and so on—remember that nature does not know it! So let us put it all back together, not forgetting ultimately what it is for. Let it give us one more ﬁnal pleasure: drink it and forget it all! 67 The Relation of Physics to Other Sciences 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:01 PM  Page 67 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:01 PM  Page 68 CONSERVATION OF ENERGY What is energy? In this chapter, we begin our more detailed study of the differ- ent aspects of physics, having ﬁnished our description of things in general. To illustrate the ideas and the kind of reasoning that might be used in theoretical physics, we shall now examine one of the most======================================================== basic laws of physics, the conservation of energy. There is a fact, or if you wish, a  law,  governing all natural phe- nomena that are known to date. There is no known exception to this law—it is exact so far as we know. The law is called the  conser- vation of energy.  It states that there is a certain quantity, which we call energy, that does not change in the manifold changes which nature undergoes. That is a most abstract idea, because it is a math- ematical principle; it says that there is a numerical quantity which does not change when something happens. It is not a description of a mechanism, or anything concrete; it is just a strange fact that we can calculate some number and when we ﬁnish watching nature go through her tricks and calculate the number again, it is the same. (Something like the bishop on a red square, and after a number of moves—details unknown—it is still on some red square. It is a law 69 4 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:01 PM  Page 69 of this nature.) Since it is an abstract idea, we shall illustrate the meaning of it by an analogy. Imagine a child, perhaps “Dennis the Menace,” who has blocks which are absolutely indestructible, and cannot be divided into pieces. Each is the same as the other. Let us suppose that he has 28 blocks. His mother puts him with his 28 blocks into a room at the beginning of the day. At the end of the day, being curious, she counts the blocks very carefully, and discovers a phenomenal law— no matter what he does with the blocks, there are always 28 re- maining! This continues for a number of days, until one day there are only 27 blocks, but a little investigating shows that there is one under the rug—she must look everywhere to be sure that the num- ber of blocks has not changed. One day, however, the number ap- pears to change—there are only 26 blocks. Careful investigation indicates that the window was open, and upon looking outside, the other two blocks are found. Another day, careful count indicates that there are 30 blocks! This causes considerable consternation, until it is realized that Bruce came to visit, bringing his blocks with him, and he left a few at Dennis’s house. After she has disposed of the extra blocks, she closes the window, does not let Bruce in, and then everything is going along all right, until one time she counts and ﬁnds only 25 blocks. However, there is a box in the room, a toy box, and the mother goes to open the toy box, but the boy says, “No, do not open my toy box,” and screams. Mother is not allowed to open the toy box. Being extremely curious, and somewhat in- genious, she invents a scheme! She knows that a block weighs three ounces, so she weighs the box at a time when she sees 28 blocks, and it weighs 16 ounces. The next time she wishes to check, she weighs the box again, subtracts 16 ounces, and divides by 3. She discovers the following: (4.1) number of blocksseen 3ounces (weightof box) 16ounces constant. = + - cm 70 Six Easy Pieces 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:01 PM  Page 70 There then appear to be some new deviations, but careful study indicates that the dirty water in the bathtub is changing its level. The child is throwing blocks into the water, and she cannot see them because it is so dirty, but she can ﬁnd out how many blocks are in the water by adding another term to her formula. Since the original height of the water was 6 inches and each block raises the water a quarter of an inch, this new formula would be: (4.2) constant. += number of blocksseen 3ounces (weightof box) 16ounces 1/4inch (heightof water) 6inches + - - cm 71 Conservation of Energy In the gradual increase in the complexity of her world, she ﬁnds a whole series of terms representing ways of calculating how many blocks are in places where she is not allowed to look. As a result, she ﬁnds a complex formula, a quantity which  has to be computed, which always stays the same in her situation. What is the analogy of this to the conservation of energy? The most remarkable aspect that must be abstracted from this picture is that  there are no blocks.  Take away the ﬁrst terms in (4.1) and (4.2) and we ﬁnd ourselves calculating more or less abstract things. The analogy has the following points: First, when we are calculating the energy, sometimes some of it leaves the system and goes away, or sometimes some comes in. In order to verify the conservation of energy, we must be careful that we have not put any in or taken any out. Second, the energy has a large number of  different forms, and there is a formula for each one. These are gravitational energy, kinetic energy, heat energy, elastic energy, electrical energy, chemical energy, radiant energy, nuclear energy, mass energy. If we total up the formulas for each of these contributions, it will not change ex- cept for energy going in and out. It is important to realize that in physics today, we have no knowl- edge of what energy  is.  We do not have a picture that energy comes======================================================== The reason this unit was chosen is historical, and we shall not go into it now. More massive particles are put higher up on the chart; we see that a neutron and a proton have almost the same mass. In vertical columns we have put the particles with the same electrical charge, all neutral objects in one column, all positively charged ones to the right of this one, and all negatively charged objects to the left. Particles are shown with a solid line and “resonances” with a dashed one. Several particles have been omitted from the table. These include the important zero-mass, zero-charge particles, the photon and the graviton, which do not fall into the baryon-meson- lepton classiﬁcation scheme, and also some of the newer resonances (K * ,  φ ,  η ). The antiparticles of the mesons are listed in the table, but the antiparticles of the leptons and baryons would have to be listed in another table which would look exactly like this one re- ﬂected on the zero-charge column. Although all of the particles ex- cept the electron, neutrino, photon, graviton, and proton are unstable, decay products have been shown only for the resonances. Strangeness assignments are not applicable for leptons, since they do not interact strongly with nuclei. All particles which are together with the neutrons and protons are called  baryons,  and the following ones exist: There is a “lambda,” with a mass of 1115 Mev, and three others, called sigmas, minus, 40 Six Easy Pieces 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:01 PM  Page 40 41 Basic Physics Table 2-2 Elementary Particles. 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:01 PM  Page 41 neutral, and plus, with several masses almost the same. There are groups or multiplets with almost the same mass, within 1 or 2 per- cent. Each particle in a multiplet has the same strangeness. The ﬁrst multiplet is the proton-neutron doublet, and then there is a singlet (the lambda), then the sigma triplet, and ﬁnally the xi doublet. Very recently, in 1961, even a few more particles were found. Or  are  they particles? They live so short a time, they disintegrate almost instan- taneously, as soon as they are formed, that we do not know whether they should be considered as new particles, or some kind of “reso- nance” interaction of a certain deﬁnite energy between the  Λ and π  products into which they disintegrate. In addition to the baryons the other particles which are involved in the nuclear interaction are called  mesons.  There are ﬁrst the pions, which come in three varieties, positive, negative, and neutral; they form another multiplet. We have also found some new things called K-mesons, and they occur as a doublet, K + and K 0 .  Also, every particle has its antiparticle, unless a particle  is its own  antipar- ticle. For example, the  π– and the  π+ are antiparticles, but the  π 0 is its own antiparticle. The K – and K + are antiparticles, and the K 0 and  .  In addition, in 1961 we also found some more mesons or maybe  mesons which disintegrate almost immediately. A thing called  ω which goes into three pions has a mass 780 on this scale, and somewhat less certain is an object which disintegrates into two pions. These particles, called mesons and baryons, and the antipar- ticles of the mesons are on the same chart, but the antiparticles of the baryons must be put on another chart, “reﬂected” through the charge-zero column. Just as Mendeléev’s chart was very good, except for the fact that there were a number of rare earth elements which were hanging out loose from it, so we have a number of things hanging out loose from this chart—particles which do not interact strongly in nuclei, have nothing to do with a nuclear interaction, and do not have a strong interaction (I mean the powerful kind of interaction of nu- clear energy). These are called leptons, and they are the following: K 0 42 Six Easy Pieces 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:01 PM  Page 42 there is the electron, which has a very small mass on this scale, only 0.510 Mev. Then there is that other, the  μ -meson, the muon, which has a mass much higher, 206 times as heavy as an electron. So far as we can tell, by all experiments so far, the difference between the electron and the muon is nothing but the mass. Everything works exactly the same for the muon as for the electron, except that one is heavier than the other. Why is there another one heavier; what is the use for it? We do not know. In addition, there is a lepton which is neutral, called a neutrino, and this particle has zero mass. In fact, it is now known that there are  two  different kinds of neutrinos, one related to electrons and the other related to muons. Finally, we have two other particles which do not interact strongly with the nuclear ones: one is a photon, and perhaps, if the ﬁeld of gravity also has a quantum-mechanical analog (a quantum theory of gravitation has not yet been worked out), then there will be a particle, a graviton, which will have zero mass. What is this======================================================== electrons as they pass by 129 Quantum Behavior 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:01 PM  Page 129 does  not  get weaker.  It is always the same-sized ﬂash.  The only  thing that happens as the light is made dimmer  is that sometimes we hear a “click” from the detector but see  no ﬂash at all.  The electron has gone by without being “seen.” What we are observing is that light also  acts like electrons; we  knew  that it was “wavy,” but now we ﬁnd that it is also “lumpy.” It always arrives—or is scattered—  in lumps that we call “photons.” As we turn down the  intensity  of the light source we do not change the  size  of the photons, only the rate  at which they are emitted.  That  explains why, when our source is dim, some electrons get by without being seen. There did not happen to be a photon around at the time the electron went through. This is all a little discouraging. If it is true that whenever we “see” the electron we see the same-sized ﬂash, then those electrons we see are  always  the disturbed ones. Let us try the experiment with a dim light anyway. Now whenever we hear a click in the detector we will keep a count in three columns: in Column 1 those electrons seen by hole 1, in Column 2 those electrons seen by hole 2, and in Column 3 those electrons not seen at all. When we work up our data (computing the probabilities) we ﬁnd these results: Those “seen by hole 1” have a distribution like  P' 1 ; those “seen by hole 2” have a distribution like  P' 2  (so that those “seen by either hole 1 or 2” have a distribution like  P' 12 ); and those “not seen at all” have a “wavy” distribution just like  P 12 of Fig. 6-3!  If the electrons are not seen, we have interference! That is understandable. When we do not see the electron, no photon disturbs it, and when we do see it, a photon has disturbed it. There is always the same amount of disturbance because the light photons all produce the same-sized effects and the effect of the photons being scattered is enough to smear out any interference effect. Is there not  some  way we can see the electrons without disturbing them? We learned in an earlier chapter that the momentum carried by a “photon” is inversely proportional to its wavelength ( p = h/ l ). Certainly the jolt given to the electron when the photon is scattered 130 Six Easy Pieces 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:01 PM  Page 130 toward our eye depends on the momentum that photon carries. Aha! If we want to disturb the electrons only slightly we should not have lowered the  intensity  of the light; we should have lowered its frequency  (the same as increasing its wavelength). Let us use light of a redder color. We could even use infrared light, or radiowaves (like radar), and “see” where the electron went with the help of some equipment that can “see” light of these longer wavelengths. If we use “gentler” light perhaps we can avoid disturbing the elec- trons so much. Let us try the experiment with longer waves. We shall keep re- peating our experiment, each time with light of a longer wave- length. At ﬁrst, nothing seems to change. The results are the same. Then a terrible thing happens. You remember that when we dis- cussed the microscope we pointed out that, due to the  wave nature of the light, there is a limitation on how close two spots can be and still be seen as two separate spots. This distance is of the order of the wavelength of light. So now, when we make the wavelength longer than the distance between our holes, we see a  big  fuzzy ﬂash when the light is scattered by the electrons. We can no longer tell which hole the electron went through! We just know it went some- where! And it is just with light of this color that we ﬁnd that the jolts given to the electron are small enough so that  P' 12 begins to look like  P 12 —that we begin to get some interference effect. And it is only for wavelengths much longer than the separation of the two holes (when we have no chance at all of telling where the elec- tron went) that the disturbance due to the light gets sufficiently small that we again get the curve  P 12 shown in Fig. 6-3. In our experiment we ﬁnd that it is impossible to arrange the light in such a way that one can tell which hole the electron went through, and at the same time not disturb the pattern. It was sug- gested by Heisenberg that the then-new laws of nature could only be consistent if there were some basic limitation on our experimen- tal capabilities not previously recognized. He proposed, as a general principle, his  uncertainty principle,  which we can state in terms of our experiment as follows: “It is impossible to design an apparatus 131 Quantum Behavior 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:01 PM  Page 131 to determine which hole the electron passes through, that will not at the same time disturb the electrons enough to destroy the inter- ference pattern.” If an apparatus is capable of determining which hole the electron goes through, it  cannot  be so======================================================== consider the time it takes light to go across a proton, 10 –24 sec- ond. If we compare this time with the  age of the universe,  2  ¥ 10 10 years, the answer is 10 –42 . It has about the same number of zeros going off it, so it has been proposed that the gravitational constant is related to the age of the universe. If that were the case, the grav- itational constant would change with time, because as the universe 110 Six Easy Pieces Figure 5-14 The relative strengths of electrical and gravitational interactions between two electrons.  0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:01 PM  Page 110 got older the ratio of the age of the universe to the time which it takes for light to go across a proton would be gradually increasing. Is it possible that the gravitational constant  is  changing with time? Of course the changes would be so small that it is quite difficult to be sure. One test which we can think of is to determine what would have been the effect of the change during the past 10 9 years, which is approximately the age from the earliest life on the earth to now, and one-tenth of the age of the universe. In this time, the gravity constant would have increased by about 10 percent. It turns out that if we consider the structure of the sun—the balance between the weight of its material and the rate at which radiant energy is generated inside it—we can deduce that if the gravity were 10 per- cent stronger, the sun would be much more than 10 percent brighter—by the  sixth power  of the gravity constant! If we calculate what happens to the orbit of the earth when the gravity is changing, we ﬁnd that the earth was then  closer in.  Altogether, the earth would be about 100 degrees centigrade hotter, and all of the water would not have been in the sea, but vapor in the air, so life would not have started in the sea. So we do  not  now believe that the gravity constant is changing with the age of the universe. But such arguments as the one we have just given are not very convincing, and the subject is not completely closed. It is a fact that the force of gravitation is proportional to the mass,  the quantity which is fundamentally a measure of  inertia — of how hard it is to hold something which is going around in a cir- cle. Therefore two objects, one heavy and one light, going around a larger object in the same circle at the same speed because of grav- ity, will stay together because to go in a circle  requires  a force which is stronger for a bigger mass. That is, the gravity is stronger for a given mass in  just the right proportion  so that the two objects will go around together. If one object were inside the other it would stay  inside; it is a perfect balance. Therefore, Gagarin or Titov would ﬁnd things “weightless” inside a spaceship; if they happened 111 The Theory of Gravitation 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:01 PM  Page 111 to let go of a piece of chalk, for example, it would go around the earth in exactly the same way as the whole spaceship, and so it would appear to remain suspended before them in space. It is very interesting that this force is  exactly  proportional to the mass with great precision, because if it were not exactly proportional there would be some effect by which inertia and weight would differ. The absence of such an effect has been checked with great accuracy by an experiment done ﬁrst by Eötvös in 1909 and more recently by Dicke. For all substances tried, the masses and weights are exactly proportional within 1 part in 1,000,000,000, or less. This is a re- markable experiment. Gravity and relativity Another topic deserving discussion is Einstein’s modiﬁcation of Newton’s law of gravitation. In spite of all the excitement it created, Newton’s law of gravitation is not correct! It was modiﬁed by Ein- stein to take into account the theory of relativity. According to Newton, the gravitational effect is instantaneous, that is, if we were to move a mass, we would at once feel a new force because of the new position of that mass; by such means we could send signals at inﬁnite speed. Einstein advanced arguments which suggest that we cannot send signals faster than the speed of light,  so the law of gravi- tation must be wrong. By correcting it to take the delays into ac- count, we have a new law, called Einstein’s law of gravitation. One feature of this new law which is quite easy to understand is this: In the Einstein relativity theory, anything which has  energy  has mass— mass in the sense that it is attracted gravitationally. Even light, which has an energy, has a “mass.” When a light beam, which has energy in it, comes past the sun there is an attraction on it by the sun. Thus the light does not go straight, but is deﬂected. During the eclipse of the sun, for example, the stars which are around the sun should appear displaced from where they would be if the sun were not there, and this has been observed. Finally, let us compare gravitation with other theories. In recent 112======================================================== concerning their behavior under conditions of high temperature but not very great density, so that we can an- alyze by statistical mechanics the behavior of the stellar substance. Even though we cannot reproduce the conditions on the earth, using the basic physical laws we often can tell precisely, or very closely, what will happen. So it is that physics aids astronomy. Strange as it may seem, we understand the distribution of matter in the interior of the sun far better than we understand the interior of the earth. What goes on  inside  a star is better understood than one might guess from the difficulty of having to look at a little dot of light through a telescope, because we can  calculate  what the atoms in the stars should do in most circumstances. One of the most impressive discoveries was the origin of the en- 60 Six Easy Pieces marvelous is the truth than any artists of the past imagined! Why do the poets of the present not speak of it? What men are poets who can speak of Jupiter if he were like a man, but if he is an immense spinning sphere of methane and ammonia must be silent? 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:01 PM  Page 60 ergy of the stars, that makes them continue to burn. One of the men who discovered this was out with his girlfriend the night after he realized that  nuclear reactions  must be going on in the stars in order to make them shine. She said, “Look at how pretty the stars shine!” He said, “Yes, and right now I am the only man in the world who knows  why  they shine.” She merely laughed at him. She was not impressed with being out with the only man who, at that mo- ment, knew why stars shine. Well, it is sad to be alone, but that is the way it is in this world. It is the nuclear “burning” of hydrogen which supplies the en- ergy of the sun; the hydrogen is converted into helium. Further- more, ultimately, the manufacture of various chemical elements proceeds in the centers of the stars, from hydrogen. The stuff of which  we  are made was “cooked” once, in a star, and spit out. How do we know? Because there is a clue. The proportion of the different isotopes—how much C 12 , how much C 13 , etc., is something which is never changed by  chemical  reactions, because the chemical reac- tions are so much the same for the two. The proportions are purely the result of  nuclear  reactions. By looking at the proportions of the isotopes in the cold, dead ember which we are, we can discover what the  furnace  was like in which the stuff of which we are made was formed. That furnace was like the stars, and so it is very likely that our elements were “made” in the stars and spit out in the ex- plosions which we call novae and supernovae. Astronomy is so close to physics that we shall study many astronomical things as we go along. Geology We turn now to what are called  earth sciences,  or  geology.  First, me- teorology and the weather. Of course the  instruments  of meteorol- ogy are physical instruments, and the development of experimental physics made these instruments possible, as was explained before. However, the theory of meteorology has never been satisfactorily 61 The Relation of Physics to Other Sciences 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:01 PM  Page 61 worked out by the physicist. “Well,” you say, “there is nothing but air, and we know the equations of the motions of air.” Yes we do. “So if we know the condition of air today, why can’t we ﬁgure out the condition of the air tomorrow?” First, we do not  really know what the condition is today, because the air is swirling and twisting everywhere. It turns out to be very sensitive, and even unstable. If you have ever seen water run smoothly over a dam, and then turn into a large number of blobs and drops as it falls, you will understand what I mean by unstable. You know the con- dition of the water before it goes over the spillway; it is perfectly smooth; but the moment it begins to fall, where do the drops begin? What determines how big the lumps are going to be and where they will be? That is not known, because the water is un- stable. Even a smooth moving mass of air going over a mountain turns into complex whirlpools and eddies. In many ﬁelds we ﬁnd this situation of  turbulent ﬂow  that we cannot analyze today. Quickly we leave the subject of weather, and discuss geology! The question basic to geology is, what makes the earth the way it is? The most obvious processes are in front of your very eyes, the erosion processes of the rivers, the winds, etc. It is easy enough to understand these, but for every bit of erosion there is an equal amount of something else going on. Mountains are no lower today, on the average, than they were in the past. There must be mountain- forming processes. You will ﬁnd, if you study geology, that there  are  mountain-forming processes and volcan- ism, which nobody understands but which is half of geology. The phenomenon of volcanoes is really not understood. What makes an earthquake is,======================================================== delicate that it does not disturb the pattern in an essential way. No one has ever found (or even thought of) a way around the uncertainty principle. So we must assume that it describes a basic characteristic of nature. The complete theory of quantum mechanics which we now use to describe atoms and, in fact, all matter depends on the correctness of the uncertainty principle. Since quantum mechanics is such a successful theory, our belief in the uncertainty principle is rein- forced. But if a way to “beat” the uncertainty principle were ever discovered, quantum mechanics would give inconsistent results and would have to be discarded as a valid theory of nature. “Well,” you say, “what about Proposition A? It is true, or is it not  true, that the electron either goes through hole 1 or it goes through hole 2?” The only answer that can be given is that we have found from experiment that there is a certain special way that we have to think in order that we do not get into inconsistencies. What we must say (to avoid making wrong predictions) is the following: If one looks at the holes or, more accurately, if one has a piece of apparatus which is capable of determining whether the electrons go through hole 1 or hole 2, then one  can  say that it goes either through hole 1 or hole 2.  But,  when one does  not  try to tell which way the electron goes, when there is nothing in the experiment to disturb the electrons, then one may  not  say that an electron goes either through hole 1 or hole 2. If one does say that, and starts to make any deductions from the statement, he will make errors in the analysis. This is the logical tightrope on which we must walk if we wish to describe nature successfully. If the motion of all matter—as well as electrons—must be de- scribed in terms of waves, what about the bullets in our ﬁrst exper- iment? Why didn’t we see an interference pattern there? It turns 132 Six Easy Pieces 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:01 PM  Page 132 out that for the bullets the wavelengths were so tiny that the inter- ference patterns became very ﬁne. So ﬁne, in fact, that with any detector of ﬁnite size one could not distinguish the separate maxima and minima. What we saw was only a kind of average, which is the classical curve. In Fig. 6-5 we have tried to indicate schematically what happens with large-scale objects. Part (a) of the ﬁgure shows the probability distribution one might predict for bullets, using quantum mechanics. The rapid wiggles are supposed to represent the interference pattern one gets for waves of very short wavelength. Any physical detector, however, straddles several wiggles of the 133 Quantum Behavior probability curve, so that the measurements show the smooth curve drawn in part (b) of the ﬁgure. First principles of quantum mechanics We will now write a summary of the main conclusions of our ex- periments. We will, however, put the results in a form which makes them true for a general class of such experiments. We can write our Figure 6-5 Interference pattern with bullets: (a) actual (schematic),  (b) observed.  0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:01 PM  Page 133 summary more simply if we ﬁrst deﬁne an “ideal experiment” as one in which there are no uncertain external inﬂuences, i.e., no jig- gling or other things going on that we cannot take into account. We would be quite precise if we said: “An ideal experiment is one in which all of the initial and ﬁnal conditions of the experiment are completely speciﬁed.” What we will call “an event” is, in general, just a speciﬁc set of initial and ﬁnal conditions. (For example: “An electron leaves the gun, arrives at the detector, and nothing else happens.”) Now for our summary. Summary (1) The probability of an event in an ideal experiment is given by the square of the absolute value of a complex number  f which is called the probability amplitude. P = probability, f = probability amplitude, (6.6) P = | f | 2 . (2) When an event can occur in several alternative ways, the probability amplitude for the event is the sum of the proba- bility amplitudes for each way considered separately. There is interference. f =  f 1 +  f 2 , P = | f 1 +  f 2 | 2 . (6.7) (3) If an experiment is performed which is capable of determin- ing whether one or another alternative is actually taken, the probability of the event is the sum of the probabilities for each alternative. The interference is lost. P = P 1 + P 2 . (6.8) 134 Six Easy Pieces 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:01 PM  Page 134 One might still like to ask: “How does it work? What is the ma- chinery behind the law?” No one has found any machinery behind the law. No one can “explain” any more than we have just “ex- plained.” No one will give you any deeper representation of the sit- uation. We have no ideas about a more basic mechanism from which these results can be deduced. We would like to emphasize a very important difference between classical and quantum mechanics.  We have been======================================================== from that ob- tained with bullets (6.1). If we expand  we see that  (6.3) where  ▼ is the phase difference between  and  . In terms of the intensities, we could write (6.4) The last term in (6.4) is the “interference term.” So much for water waves. The intensity can have any value, and it shows interference. An experiment with electrons Now we imagine a similar experiment with electrons. It is shown diagrammatically in Fig. 6-3. We make an electron gun which con- sists of a tungsten wire heated by an electric current and surrounded by a metal box with a hole in it. If the wire is at a negative voltage with respect to the box, electrons emitted by the wire will be accel- erated toward the walls and some will pass through the hole. All the electrons which come out of the gun will have (nearly) the same he it 1 ~ t h 1 t he it 2 ~ t | | h 1 2 t | | h 2 2 t () hh e it 12 + ~ tt | 2 | hh 12 + tt . ,, || | 2 || | Ih Ih I h h 11 2 22 2 12 1 2 == = + tt t t | 2 | hh 12 + tt |cos , d h | | h 2| + | + h | | h | 2 = 12 1 2 2 2 12 | | hh + tt t t tt h 1 t 2c o s II I I I . 12 1 2 1 2 =++ d h 2 t 122 Six Easy Pieces 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:01 PM  Page 122 energy. In front of the gun is again a wall (just a thin metal plate) with two holes in it. Beyond the wall is another plate which will serve as a “backstop.” In front of the backstop we place a movable detector. The detector might be a geiger counter or, perhaps better, an electron multiplier, which is connected to a loudspeaker. We should say right away that you should not try to set up this experiment (as you could have done with the two we have already described). This experiment has never been done in just this way. The trouble is that the apparatus would have to be made on an im- possibly small scale to show the effects we are interested in. We are doing a “thought experiment,” which we have chosen because it is easy to think about. We know the results that  would  be obtained because there  are  many experiments that have been done, in which the scale and the proportions have been chosen to show the effects we shall describe. The ﬁrst thing we notice with our electron experiment is that we hear sharp “clicks” from the detector (that is, from the loud- speaker). And all “clicks” are the same. There are  no  “half-clicks.” We would also notice that the “clicks” come very erratically. Something like: click . . . . . click-click . . . click . . . . . . . . click . . . . 123 Quantum Behavior Figure 6-3 Interference experiment with electrons. 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:01 PM  Page 123 click-click . . . . . . click . . . , etc., just as you have, no doubt, heard a geiger counter operating. If we count the clicks which arrive in a sufficiently long time—say, for many minutes—and then count again for another equal period, we ﬁnd that the two numbers are very nearly the same. So we can speak of the  average rate  at which the clicks are heard (so-and-so-many clicks per minute on the average). As we move the detector around, the  rate  at which the clicks ap- pear is faster or slower, but the size (loudness) of each click is always the same. If we lower the temperature of the wire in the gun the rate of clicking slows down, but still each click sounds the same. We would notice also that if we put two separate detectors at the backstop, one  or  the other would click, but never both at once. (Ex- cept that once in a while, if there were two clicks very close together in time, our ear might not sense the separation.) We conclude, therefore, that whatever arrives at the backstop arrives in “lumps.” All the “lumps” are the same size: only whole “lumps” arrive, and they arrive one at a time at the backstop. We shall say: “Electrons always arrive in identical lumps.” Just as for our experiment with bullets, we can now proceed to ﬁnd experimentally the answer to the question: “What is the rel- ative probability that an electron  ‘lump’ will arrive at the backstop at various distances  x  from the center?” As before, we obtain the relative probability by observing the rate of clicks, holding the operation of the gun  constant. The probability that lumps will ar- rive at a particular  x is proportional to the average rate of clicks at that  x . The result of our experiment is the interesting curve marked  P 12 in part (c) of Fig. 6-3. Yes! That is the way electrons go. The interference of electron waves Now let us try to analyze the curve of Fig. 6-3 to see whether we can understand the behavior of the electrons. The ﬁrst thing we would say is that since they come in lumps, each lump, which  we may as 124 Six Easy Pieces 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:01 PM  Page 124 well call an electron, has come either through hole 1 or through hole 2. Let us write this in the form of a “Proposition”: Proposition A : Each electron  either  goes through hole 1  or  it goes through hole 2. Assuming Proposition A, all electrons that arrive at the backstop can======================================================== and pull it out and let go, then the pendulum will swing almost in a plane, but not quite. Slowly the plane keeps changing in Stockholm, but not in Quito. The blinds are down, 35 Basic Physics 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:01 PM  Page 35 too. The fact that this happened does not bring on the destruction of science. What  is  the fundamental hypothesis of science, the fundamental philosophy? We stated it in the ﬁrst chapter:  the sole test of the validity of any idea is experiment.  If it turns out that most experiments work out the same in Quito as they do in Stockholm, then those “most experiments” will be used to formulate some general law, and those experiments which do not come out the same we will say were a result of the environment near Stockholm. We will invent some way to summarize the results of the experi- ment, and we do not have to be told ahead of time what this way will look like. If we are told that the same experiment will always produce the same result, that is all very well, but if when we try it, it does  not,  then it does  not.  We just have to take what we see, and then formulate all the rest of our ideas in terms of our actual experience. Returning again to quantum mechanics and fundamental physics, we cannot go into details of the quantum-mechanical principles at this time, of course, because these are rather difficult to understand. We shall assume that they are there, and go on to describe what some of the consequences are. One of the conse- quences is that things which we used to consider as waves also behave like particles, and particles behave like waves; in fact everything behaves the same way. There is no distinction between a wave and a particle. So quantum mechanics  uniﬁes  the idea of the ﬁeld and its waves, and the particles, all into one. Now it is true that when the frequency is low, the ﬁeld aspect of the phe- nomenon is more evident, or more useful as an approximate de- scription in terms of everyday experiences. But as the frequency increases, the particle aspects of the phenomenon become more evident with the equipment with which we usually make the mea- surements. In fact, although we mentioned many frequencies, no phenomenon directly involving a frequency has yet been detected above approximately 10 12 cycles per second. We only  deduce  the higher frequencies from the energy of the particles, by a rule 36 Six Easy Pieces 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:01 PM  Page 36 which assumes that the particle-wave idea of quantum mechanics is valid. Thus we have a new view of electromagnetic interaction. We have a new kind of  particle  to add to the electron, the proton, and the neutron. That new particle is called a  photon.  The new view of the interaction of electrons and photons that is electromagnetic theory, but with everything quantum-mechanically correct, is called quantum electrodynamics.  This fundamental theory of the interac- tion of light and matter, or electric ﬁeld and charges, is our greatest success so far in physics. In this one theory we have the basic rules for all ordinary phenomena except for gravitation and nuclear pro- cesses. For example, out of quantum electrodynamics come all known electrical, mechanical, and chemical laws: the laws for the collision of billiard balls, the motions of wires in magnetic ﬁelds, the speciﬁc heat of carbon monoxide, the color of neon signs, the density of salt, and the reactions of hydrogen and oxygen to make water are all consequences of this one law. All these details can be worked out if the situation is simple enough for us to make an ap- proximation, which is almost never, but often we can understand more or less what is happening. At the present time no exceptions are found to the quantum-electrodynamic laws outside the nucleus, and there we do not know whether there is an exception because we simply do not know what is going on in the nucleus. In principle, then, quantum electrodynamics is the theory of all chemistry, and of life, if life is ultimately reduced to chemistry and therefore just to physics because chemistry is already reduced (the part of physics which is involved in chemistry being already known). Furthermore, the same quantum electrodynamics, this great thing, predicts a lot of new things. In the ﬁrst place, it tells the properties of very high-energy photons, gamma rays, etc. It predicted another very remarkable thing: besides the electron, there should be another particle of the same mass, but of opposite charge, called a  positron,  and these two, coming together, could annihilate each other with the emission of light or gamma rays. 37 Basic Physics 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:01 PM  Page 37 (After all, light and gamma rays are all the same; they are just dif- ferent points on a frequency scale.) The generalization of this, that for each particle there is an antiparticle, turns out to be true. In the case of electrons, the antiparticle has another name—it is======================================================== ultimately, not understood. It is understood that if something is pushing something else, it snaps and will slide—that is all right. But what pushes, and why? The theory is that there are currents inside the earth—circulating currents, due to the difference in temperature inside and outside—which, in their motion, push the surface slightly. Thus if there are two op- posite circulations next to each other, the matter will collect in 62 Six Easy Pieces 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:01 PM  Page 62 the region where they meet and make belts of mountains which are in unhappy stressed conditions, and so produce volcanoes and earthquakes. What about the inside of the earth? A great deal is known about the speed of earthquake waves through the earth and the density of distribution of the earth. However, physicists have been unable to get a good theory as to how dense a substance should be at the pressures that would be expected at the center of the earth. In other words, we cannot ﬁgure out the properties of matter very well in these circumstances. We do much less well with the earth than we do with the conditions of matter in the stars. The math- ematics involved seems a little too difficult, so far, but perhaps it will not be too long before someone realizes that it is an important problem, and really works it out. The other aspect, of course, is that even if we did know the density, we cannot ﬁgure out the cir- culating currents. Nor can we really work out the properties of rocks at high pressure. We cannot tell how fast the rocks should “give”; that must all be worked out by experiment. Psychology Next, we consider the science of  psychology.  Incidentally, psycho- analysis is not a science: it is at best a medical process, and perhaps even more like witch-doctoring. It has a theory as to what causes disease—lots of different “spirits,” etc. The witch doctor has a theory that a disease like malaria is caused by a spirit which comes into the air; it is not cured by shaking a snake over it, but quinine does help malaria. So, if you are sick, I would advise that you go to the witch doctor because he is the man in the tribe who knows the most about the disease; on the other hand, his knowledge is not science. Psychoanalysis has not been checked carefully by ex- periment, and there is no way to ﬁnd a list of the number of cases in which it works, the number of cases in which it does not work, etc. 63 The Relation of Physics to Other Sciences 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:01 PM  Page 63 The other branches of psychology, which involve things like the physiology of sensation—what happens in the eye, and what hap- pens in the brain—are, if you wish, less interesting. But some small but real progress has been made in studying them. One of the most interesting technical problems may or may not be called psychol- ogy. The central problem of the mind, if you will, or the nervous system, is this: when an animal learns something, it can do some- thing different than it could before, and its brain cell must have changed too, if it is made out of atoms.  In what way is it different? We do not know where to look, or what to look for, when some- thing is memorized. We do not know what it means, or what change there is in the nervous system, when a fact is learned. This is a very important problem which has not been solved at all. As- suming, however, that there is some kind of memory thing, the brain is such an enormous mass of interconnecting wires and nerves that it probably cannot be analyzed in a straightforward manner. There is an analog of this to computing machines and computing elements, in that they also have a lot of lines, and they have some kind of element, analogous, perhaps, to the synapse, or connection of one nerve to another. This is a very interesting subject which we have not the time to discuss further—the relationship between thinking and computing machines. It must be appreciated, of course, that this subject will tell us very little about the real com- plexities of ordinary human behavior. All human beings are so dif- ferent. It will be a long time before we get there. We must start much further back. If we could even ﬁgure out how a  dog  works, we would have gone pretty far. Dogs are easier to understand, but nobody yet knows how dogs work. How did it get that way? In order for physics to be useful to other sciences in a  theoretical way, other than in the invention of instruments, the science in question must supply to the physicist a description of the object in 64 Six Easy Pieces 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:01 PM  Page 64 a physicist’s language. They can say “why does a frog jump?,” and the physicist cannot answer. If they tell him what a frog is, that there are so many molecules, there is a nerve here, etc., that is dif- ferent. If they will tell us, more or less, what the earth or the stars are like, then we can ﬁgure it out. In order for physical theory to be of any======================================================== present quantum mechanics in this reverse fashion—for several reasons which may be apparent in the lectures themselves. However, I think that the experiment in the quantum mechanics part was not completely successful—in large part because I really did not have enough time at the end (I should, for instance, have had three or four more lectures in order to deal more com- pletely with such matters as energy bands and the spatial dependence of amplitudes). Also, I had never presented the subject this way be- fore, so the lack of feedback was particularly serious. I now believe the quantum mechanics should be given at a later time. Maybe I’ll have a chance to do it again someday. Then I’ll do it right. The reason there are no lectures on how to solve problems is be- cause there were recitation sections. Although I did put in three lectures in the ﬁrst year on how to solve problems, they are not in- cluded here. Also there was a lecture on inertial guidance which certainly belongs after the lecture on rotating systems, but which was, unfortunately, omitted. The ﬁfth and sixth lectures are actually due to Matthew Sands, as I was out of town. The question, of course, is how well this experiment has suc- ceeded. My own point of view—which, however, does not seem to be shared by most of the people who worked with the students— is pessimistic. I don’t think I did very well by the students. When I look at the way the majority of the students handled the problems on the examinations, I think that the system is a failure. Of course, my friends point out to me that there were one or two dozen stu- dents who—very surprisingly—understood almost everything in all of the lectures, and who were quite active in working with the material and worrying about the many points in an excited and in- xxviii Feynman’s Preface 0465025275-Feynman_Layout 1  1/18/11  2:00 PM  Page xxviii terested way. These people have now, I believe, a ﬁrst-rate back- ground in physics—and they are, after all, the ones I was trying to get at. But then, “The power of instruction is seldom of much effi- cacy except in those happy dispositions where it is almost super- ﬂuous.” (Gibbon) Still, I didn’t want to leave any student completely behind, as perhaps I did. I think one way we could help the students more would be by putting more hard work into developing a set of prob- lems which would elucidate some of the ideas in the lectures. Prob- lems give a good opportunity to ﬁll out the material of the lectures and make more realistic, more complete, and more settled in the mind the ideas that have been exposed. I think, however, that there isn’t any solution to this problem of education other than to realize that the best teaching can be done only when there is a direct individual relationship between a stu- dent and a good teacher—a situation in which the student discusses the ideas, thinks about the things, and talks about the things. It’s impossible to learn very much by simply sitting in a lecture, or even by simply doing problems that are assigned. But in our modern times we have so many students to teach that we have to try to ﬁnd some substitute for the ideal. Perhaps my lectures can make some contribution. Perhaps in some small place where there are individ- ual teachers and students, they may get some inspiration or some ideas from the lectures. Perhaps they will have fun thinking them through—or going on to develop some of the ideas further. June 1963 Richard P.

This is not necessarily the case of course, but that is what every professor in every subject assumes! If you are going to be a physicist, you will have a lot to study: two hundred years of the most rapidly devel- oping ﬁeld of knowledge that there is. So much knowledge, in fact, that you might think that you cannot learn all of it in four years, and truly you cannot; you will have to go to graduate school too! Surprisingly enough, in spite of the tremendous amount of work that has been done for all this time it is possible to condense the enormous mass of results to a large extent—that is, to ﬁnd  laws which summarize all our knowledge. Even so, the laws are so hard to grasp that it is unfair to you to start exploring this tremendous subject without some kind of map or outline of the relationship of one part of the subject of science to another. Following these pre- liminary remarks, the ﬁrst three chapters will therefore outline the relation of physics to the rest of the sciences, the relations of the sciences to each other, and the meaning of science, to help us de- velop a “feel” for the subject. You might ask why we cannot teach physics by just giving the basic laws on page one and then showing how
