======================================================== the moon project would require a  vehicle ‘made of new metal alloys, some of which have not yet been  invented, capable of standing heat and stresses several times more than  have ever been experienced, fitted together with a precision better than  the finest watch, carrying all the equipment needed for propulsion,  guidance, control, communications, food and survival’. Those were the  known problems, which would require as-yet-unknown knowledge.  That this was ‘on an untried mission, to an unknown celestial body’  referred to the unknown problems that made the probabilities, and the  outcomes, profoundly unknowable. Yet none of that prevented rational  people from forming the expectation that the mission could succeed.  This expectation was not a judgement of probability: until far into the  project, no one could predict that, because it depended on solutions  216 the beginning of infinity not yet discovered to problems not yet known. When people were  being persuaded to work on the project – and to vote for it, and so on  – they were being persuaded that our being confined to one planet    was an evil, that exploring the universe was a good, that the Earth’s  gravitational field was not a barrier but merely a problem, and that  overcoming it and all the other problems involved in the project was  only a matter of knowing how, and that the nature of the problems  made that moment the right one to try to solve them. Probabilities and  prophecies were not needed in that argument. Pessimism has been endemic in almost every society throughout  history. It has taken the form of the precautionary principle, and of  ‘who should rule?’ political philosophies and all sorts of other demands  for prophecy, and of despair in the power of creativity, and of the  misinterpretation of problems as insuperable barriers. Yet there have  always been a few individuals who see obstacles as problems, and see  problems as soluble. And so, very occasionally, there have been places  and moments when there was, briefly, an end to pessimism. As far as  I know, no historian has investigated the history of optimism, but my  guess is that whenever it has emerged in a civilization there has been  a mini-enlightenment: a tradition of criticism resulting in an efflor- escence of many of the patterns of human progress with which we are  familiar, such as art, literature, philosophy, science, technology and the  institutions of an open society. The end of pessimism is potentially a  beginning of infinity. Yet I also guess that in every case – with the single,  tremendous exception (so far) of our own Enlightenment – this process  was soon brought to an end and the reign of pessimism was restored. The best-known mini-enlightenment was the intellectual and political  tradition of criticism in ancient Greece which culminated in the so-  called ‘Golden Age’ of the city-state of Athens in the fifth century  bce.  Athens was one of the first democracies, and was home to an astonish- ing number of people who are regarded to this day as major figures in  the history of ideas, such as the philosophers Socrates, Plato and  Aristotle, the playwrights Aeschylus, Aristophanes, Euripides and  Sophocles, and the historians Herodotus, Thucydides and Xenophon.  The Athenian philosophical tradition continued a tradition of criticism  dating back to Thales of Miletus over a century earlier and which had  included Xenophanes of Colophon (570–480  bce),  one of the first to  217 Optimism question anthropocentric theories of the gods. Athens grew wealthy  through trade, attracted creative people from all over the known world,  became one of the foremost military powers of the age, and built a  structure, the Parthenon, which is to this day regarded as one of the  great architectural achievements of all time. At the height of the Golden  Age, the Athenian leader Pericles tried to explain what made Athens  successful. Though he no doubt believed that the city’s patron goddess,  Athena, was on their side, he evidently did not consider ‘the goddess  did it’ to be a sufficient explanation for the Athenians’ success. Instead,  he listed specific attributes of Athenian civilization. We do not know  exactly how much of what he described was flattery or wishful thinking,  but, in assessing the optimism of a civilization, what that civilization  aspired to be must be even more important than what it had yet  succeeded in becoming. The first attribute that Pericles cited was Athens’ democracy. And  he explained why. Not because ‘the people should rule’, but because it  promotes ‘wise action’. It involves continual discussion, which is a  necessary condition for discovering the right answer, which is in turn  a necessary condition for progress: Instead of looking upon discussion as a stumbling-block in the way of  action, we think it an indispensable preliminary to any wise action at all. Pericles, ‘Funeral Oration’,  c . 431 bce He also mentioned  freedom  as a cause of======================================================== intentions, feelings and other states of mind that characterize an ‘I’. To  object to being ‘controlled’ by Roman numerals when we find them  helpful is like protesting at being controlled by one’s own intentions.  By that argument, it is slavery to escape from slavery. But in fact when  I obey the program that constitutes me (or when I obey the laws of  physics), ‘obey’ means something different from what a slave does. The  two meanings explain events at different levels of emergence. Contrary to what is sometimes said, there were also fairly efficient  ways of multiplying and dividing Roman numerals. So a ship with     crates, each containing jars in a   -by-   grid, could be known to hold    jars altogether without anyone having performed the lengthy  count that was implicit in that numeral. And one could tell at a    glance that    was less than   . Thus, manipulating numbers  independently of tallying or counting opened up applications such as  calculating prices, wages, taxes, interest rates and so on. It was also a  conceptual advance that opened the door to future progress. However,  in regard to these more sophisticated applications, the system was not  universal. Since there was no higher-valued symbol than    (one  thousand), the numerals from two thousand onwards all began with  a string of   ’s, which therefore became nothing more than tally marks  for thousands. The more of them there were in a numeral, the more  one would have to fall back on tallying (examining many instances of  the symbol one by one) in order to do arithmetic.  Just as one could upgrade the vocabulary of an ancient writing  system by adding pictograms, so one could add symbols to a system  of numerals to increase its range. And this was done. But the resulting  system would still always have a highest-valued symbol, and hence  131 The Jump to Universality would not be universal for doing arithmetic without tallying. The only way to emancipate arithmetic from tallying is with rules  of universal reach. As with alphabets, a small set of basic rules and  symbols is sufficient. The universal system in general use today has ten  symbols, the digits 0 to 9, and its universality is due to a rule that the  value of a digit depends on its position in the number. For instance,  the digit 2 means two when written by itself, but means two hundred  in the numeral 204. Such ‘positional’ systems require ‘placeholders’,  such as the digit 0 in 204, whose only function is to place the 2 into  the position where it means two hundred. This system originated in India, but it is not known when. It might  have been as late as the ninth century, since before that only a few  ambiguous documents seem to show it in use. At any rate, its tremen- dous potential in science, mathematics, engineering and trade was not  widely realized. At approximately that time it was embraced by Arab  scholars, yet was not generally used in the Arab world until a thousand  years later. This curious lack of enthusiasm for universality was repeated  in medieval Europe: a few scholars adopted Indian numerals from    the Arabs in the tenth century (resulting in the misnomer ‘Arabic  numerals’), but again these numerals did not come into everyday use  for centuries.  As early as 1900 bce the ancient Babylonians had invented what  was in effect a universal system of numerals, but they too may not have  cared about its universality – nor even been aware of it. It was a  positional system, but very cumbersome compared with the Indian  one. It had 59 ‘digits’, each of which was itself written as a numeral in  a Roman-numeral-like system. So using it for arithmetic with numbers  occurring in everyday life was actually more complicated than using  Roman numerals. It also had no symbol for zero, so it used spaces as  placeholders. It had no way of representing trailing zeros, and no  equivalent of the decimal point (as if, in our system, the numbers 200,  20, 2, 0.2 and so on were all written as 2, and were distinguished only  by context). All this suggests that universality was not the system’s  main design objective, and that it was not greatly valued when it was  achieved.  Perhaps an insight into this recurring oddity is provided by a re    - markable episode in the third century  bce  involving the ancient Greek  132 the beginning of infinity scientist and mathematician Archimedes. His research in astronomy  and pure mathematics led him to a need to do arithmetic with some  rather large numbers, so he had to invent his own system of numerals.  His starting point was a Greek system with which he was familiar,  similar to the Roman one but with a highest-valued symbol  Μ  for  10,000 (one myriad). The range of the system had already been ex    - tended with the rule that digits written above an  Μ  would be multiplied  by a myriad. For instance, the symbol for twenty was  κ  and the symbol  for four was  δ , so they could write twenty-four myriad (240,000)======================================================== the reason was, it cannot have been that  the hot region constituted a physical barrier, for it did not.  Those are the parochial considerations. The bigger picture is that the  spread of llamas  can only  have been prevented by people’s ideas and  outlook. Had the Andeans had a Polynesian outlook instead, llamas  might have spread all over the Americas. Had the ancient Polynesians  not had that outlook, they might never have settled Polynesia in the  first place, and biogeographical explanations would now be referring  to the great ocean barrier as the ‘ultimate explanation’ for that. If the  Polynesians had been even better at long-range trading, they might have  managed to transport horses from Asia to their islands and thence to  South America – a feat perhaps no more impressive than Hannibal’s  transporting elephants across the Alps. If the ancient Greek enlighten- ment had continued, Athenians might have been the first to settle the  Pacific islands and  they  would now be the ‘Polynesians’. Or, if the early  Andeans had worked out how to breed giant war llamas and had ridden  out to explore and conquer before anyone else had even thought of  domesticating the horse, South American biogeographers might now  be explaining that their ancestors colonized the world because no other  continent had llamas. Moreover, the Americas had not always lacked large quadrupeds.  When the first humans arrived there, many species of ‘mega-fauna’  were common, including wild horses, mammoths, mastodons and other  members of the elephant family. According to some theories, the  humans hunted them to extinction. What would have happened if one  428 the beginning of infinity of those hunters had had a different idea: to ride the beast before killing  it? Generations later, the knock-on effects of that bold conjecture might  have been tribes of warriors on horses and mammoths pouring back  through Alaska and re-conquering the Old World. Their descendants  would now be attributing this to the geographical distribution of mega- fauna. But the real cause would have been that one idea in the mind  of that one hunter. In early prehistory, populations were tiny, knowledge was parochial,  and history-making ideas were millennia apart. In those days, a meme  spread only when one person observed another enacting it nearby, and  (because of the staticity of cultures) rarely even then. So at that time  human behaviour resembled that of other animals, and much of what  happened was indeed explained by biogeography. But developments  such as abstract language, explanation, wealth above the level of subsist- ence, and long-range trade all had the potential to erode parochialism  and hence to give causal power to ideas. By the time history began to  be recorded, it had long since become the history of ideas far more than  anything else – though unfortunately the ideas were still mainly of the  self-disabling, anti-rational variety. As for subsequent history, it would  take considerable dedication to insist that biogeographical explanations  account for the broad sweep of events. Why, for instance, did the  societies in North America and Western Europe, rather than Asia and  Eastern Europe, win the Cold War? Analysing climate, minerals, flora,  fauna and diseases can teach us nothing about that. The explanation is  that the Soviet system lost because its ideology wasn’t true, and all the  biogeography in the world cannot explain what was false about it. Coincidentally, one of the things that was most false about the Soviet  ideology was the very idea that there is an ultimate explanation of  history in mechanical, non-human terms, as proposed by Marx, Engels  and Diamond. Quite generally, mechanical reinterpretations of human  affairs not only lack explanatory power, they are morally wrong as  well, for in effect they deny the humanity of the participants, casting  them and their ideas merely as side effects of the landscape. Diamond  says that his main reason for writing  Guns, Germs and Steel  was that,  unless people are convinced that the relative success of Europeans    was caused by biogeography, they will for ever be tempted by  racist   explanations. Well, not readers of this book, I trust! Presumably  429 Unsustainable Diamond can look at ancient Athens, the Renaissance, the Enlighten-  ment – all of them the quintessence of causation through the power    of abstract ideas – and see no way of attributing those events to ideas  and to people; he just takes it for granted that the only alternative to  one reductionist, dehumanizing reinterpretation of events is another.  In reality, the difference between Sparta and Athens, or between  Savonarola and Lorenzo de’ Medici, had nothing to do with their  genes; nor did the difference between the Easter Islanders and the  imperial British. They were all people – universal explainers and  constructors. But their  ideas  were different. Nor did landscape cause  the Enlightenment. It would======================================================== Popper could have made the same point by asking his audience to  imitate , rather than merely to observe. The logic would have been the  same: under what explanatory theory should they ‘imitate’?  Whom  404 the beginning of infinity should they imitate? Popper? In that case, should they walk to the  podium, push him out of the way, and stand where he had been  standing? If not, should they at least turn to face the rear of the room,  to imitate where he was facing? Should they imitate his heavy Austrian  accent, or should they speak in their normal voices, because he was  speaking in his normal voice? Or should they do nothing special at the  time, but merely include such demonstrations in their lectures when  they themselves became professors of philosophy? There are infinitely  many possible interpretations of ‘imitate Popper’, each defining a  different behaviour for the imitator. Many of those ways would look  very different from each other. Each way corresponds to a different  theory of what ideas, in Popper’s mind, were causing the observed  behaviour. So there is no such thing as ‘just imitating the behaviour’ – still less,  therefore, can one discover those  ideas  by imitating it. One needs to  know the ideas  before  one can imitate the behaviour. So imitating  behaviour cannot be how we acquire memes. The hypothetical genes that caused meme replication by imitation  would also have to specify  whom  to imitate. Blackmore, for instance,  suggests that the criterion may be ‘imitate the best imitators’. But this  is impossible for the same reason. One can only judge how well  someone is imitating if one already knows, or has guessed,  what  (which  aspect of behaviour, and whose) they are imitating, and which of the  circumstances they are taking into account and how. The same holds if the behaviour consists of  stating  the memes. As  Popper remarked, ‘It is impossible to speak in such a way that you  cannot be misunderstood.’ One can only state the explicit content,  which is insufficient to define the meaning of a meme or anything else.  Even the most explicit of memes – such as laws – have inexplicit content  without which they cannot be enacted. For example, many laws refer  to what is ‘reasonable’. But no one can define that attribute accurately  enough for, say, a person from a different culture to be able to apply  the definition in judging a criminal case. Hence we certainly do not  learn what ‘reasonable’ means by hearing its meaning  stated . But we  do learn it, and the versions of it that are learned by people in the same  culture are sufficiently close for laws based on it to be practicable.  In any case, as I remarked in the previous chapter, we do not explicitly  405 The Evolution of Creativity know the rules by which we behave. We know the rules, meanings and  patterns of speech of our native language largely inexplicitly, yet we  pass its rules on with remarkable fidelity to the next generation –  including the ability to apply them in situations the new holder has  never experienced, and including patterns of speech that people ex    - plicitly try to prevent the next generation from replicating. The real situation is that people need inexplicit knowledge to under- stand laws and other explicit statements, not vice versa. Philosophers  and psychologists work hard to discover, and to make explicit, the  assumptions that our culture tacitly makes about social institutions,  human nature, right and wrong, time and space, intention, causality,  freedom, necessity and so on. But we do not acquire those assump  -  tions by reading the results of such research: it is entirely the other    way round. If behaviour is impossible to imitate without prior knowledge of the  theory causing the behaviour, how it is that apes, famously, can ape?  They have memes: they can learn a new way of opening a nut by  watching another ape that already knows that way. How is it that apes  are not confused by the infinite ambiguity of what it means to imitate?  Even parrots, famously, parrot: they can commit to memory dozens    of sounds that they have heard, and repeat them later. How do they  cope with the ambiguity of which sounds to imitate, and when to    repeat them? They cope with it by knowing the relevant inexplicit theories in  advance. Or, rather, their genes know them. Evolution has built into  the genes of parrots an implicit definition of what ‘imitating’ means:  to them, it means recording sequences of sounds that meet some inborn  criterion, and later replaying them under conditions that meet some  other inborn criterion. An interesting fact follows, about parrot physi- ology: the parrot’s brain must also contain a translation system that  analyses incoming nerve signals from the ears and generates outgoing  ones that will cause the parrot’s vocal cords to play the same sounds.  That translation requires some quite sophisticated computation, which  is encoded in genes, not memes. It is======================================================== nesting materials, and so on. Suppose that  initially the whole population has genes that cause them to nest at that  90 the beginning of infinity optimum time. That would mean that those genes were well adapted  to maximizing the number of birds in the population – which one  might call ‘maximizing the good of the species’. Now suppose that this equilibrium is disturbed by the advent of a  mutant gene in a single bird which causes it to nest slightly earlier –  say, at the end of March. Assume that when a bird has built a nest, the  species’ other behavioural genes are such that it automatically gets  whatever cooperation it needs from a mate. That pair of birds would  then be guaranteed the best nesting site on the island – an advantage  which, in terms of the survival of their offspring, might well outweigh  all the slight disadvantages of nesting earlier. In that case, in the  following generation, there will be more March-nesting birds, and,  again, all of them will find excellent nesting sites. That means that a  smaller proportion than usual of the April-nesting variety will find  good sites: the best sites will have been taken by the time they start  looking. In subsequent generations, the balance of the population    will keep shifting towards the March-nesting variants. If the relative  advantage of having the best nesting sites is large enough, the April- nesting variant could even become extinct. If it arises again as a  mutation, its holder will have no offspring, because all sites will have  been taken by the time it tries to nest. Thus the original situation that we imagined – with genes that    were optimally adapted to maximizing the population (‘benefiting the  species’) – is unstable. There will be evolutionary pressure to make the  genes become  less  well adapted to that function. This change has harmed the species, in the sense of reducing its total  population (because the birds are no longer nesting at the optimum  time). It may thereby also have harmed it by increasing the risk of  extinction, making it less likely to spread to other habitats, and so on.  So an optimally adapted species may in this way evolve into one that  is less ‘well off’ by any measure. If a further mutant gene then appears, causing nesting still earlier in  March, the same process may be repeated, with the earlier-nesting  genes taking over and the total population falling again. Evolution will  thus drive the nesting time ever earlier, and the population lower. A  new equilibrium would be reached only when the advantage to an  individual bird’s offspring of getting the very best nesting site was  91 Creation finally outweighed by the  dis advantages of slightly earlier nesting. That  equilibrium might be very far from what was optimal for the species. A related misconception is that evolution is always  adaptive  – that  it always constitutes progress, or at least some sort of improvement in  useful functionality which it then acts to optimize. This is often summed  up in a phrase due to the philosopher Herbert Spencer, and unfortunately  taken up by Darwin himself: ‘the survival of the fittest’. But, as the  above thought experiment illustrates, that is not the case either. Not  only has the species been harmed by this evolutionary change, every  individual bird has been harmed as well: the birds using any particular  site now have a harsher life than before, because they are using it earlier  in the year. Thus, although the existence of progress in the biosphere is what  the theory of evolution is there to explain, not all evolution constitutes  progress, and no (genetic) evolution optimizes progress.  What exactly  has  the evolution of those birds achieved during that  period? It has optimized not the functional adaptation of a variant  gene to its environment – the attribute that would have impressed Paley  – but the relative ability of the surviving variant to  spread through the  population . An April-nesting gene is no longer able to propagate itself  to the next generation, even though it is functionally the best variant.  The early-nesting gene that replaced it may still be tolerably functional,  but it is  fittest  for nothing except preventing variants of itself from  procreating. From the point of view of both the species and all its  members, the change brought about by this period of its evolution has  been a disaster. But evolution does not ‘care’ about that. It favours only  the genes that spread best through the population. Evolution can even favour genes that are not just suboptimal, but  wholly harmful to the species and all its individuals. A famous example  is the peacock’s large, colourful tail, which is believed to diminish the  bird’s viability by making it harder to evade predators, and to have no  useful function at all. Genes for prominent tails dominate simply  because peahens tend to choose prominent-tailed males as mates. Why  was there selection pressure in favour of such======================================================== be able to harness physical phenomena of which  we are unaware. Also, that teleportation to or from another location  would be mistaken for ‘destruction’ (without trace) and ‘creation’ (out  of thin air) in your experiment and that therefore this cannot be ruled  out as a possible cause of the anomalies. When headlines appear of the form ‘Teleportation Possibly  Observed in City Museum, Say Scientists’ and ‘Scientists Prove Alien  323 A Physicist’s History of Bad Philosophy Abduction is Real,’ protest mildly that you have claimed no such  thing, that your results are not conclusive, merely suggestive, and  that more studies are needed to determine the mechanism of this  perplexing phenomenon. You have made no false claim. Data can become ‘inconsistent with  conventional physics’ by the mundane means of containing errors, just  as genes can ‘cause happiness’ by countless mundane means such as  affecting your appearance. The fact that your paper does not point this  out does not make it false. Moreover, as I said, the crucial step consists  of a definition, and definitions, provided only that they are consistent,  cannot be false. You have  defined  an observation of more people entering  than leaving as a ‘destruction’ of people. Although, in everyday language,  that phrase has a connotation of people disappearing in puffs of smoke,  that is not what it means in this study. For all you know, they  could  be  disappearing in puffs of smoke, or in invisible spaceships: that would  be consistent with your data. But your paper takes no position on that.  It is entirely about the outcomes of your observations.  So you had better not name your research paper ‘Errors Made When  Counting People Incompetently’. Aside from being a public-relations  blunder, that title might even be considered unscientific, according to  explanationless science. For it would be taking a position on the  ‘interpretation’ of the observed data, about which it provides no  evidence.  In my view this is a scientific experiment in form only. The substance  of scientific theories is explanation, and explanation  of   errors  constitutes  most of the content of the design of any non-trivial scientific experiment. As the above example illustrates, a generic feature of experimentation  is that the bigger the errors you make, either in the numbers or in your  naming and interpretation of the measured quantities, the more exciting  the results are,  if true . So, without powerful techniques of error-detection  and -correction – which depend on explanatory theories – this gives  rise to an instability where false results drown out the true. In the ‘hard  sciences’ – which usually do good science – false results due to all sorts  of errors are nevertheless common. But they are corrected when    their explanations are criticized and tested. That cannot happen in  explanationless science. Consequently, as soon as scientists allow themselves to stop demand- 324 the beginning of infinity ing good explanations and consider only whether a prediction is  accurate or inaccurate, they are liable to make fools of themselves. This  is the means by which a succession of eminent physicists over the  decades have been fooled by conjurers into believing that various  conjuring tricks have been done by ‘paranormal’ means. Bad philosophy cannot easily be countered by good philosophy –  argument and explanation – because it holds itself immune. But it can  be countered by  progress . People want to understand the world, no  matter how loudly they may deny that. And progress makes bad  philosophy harder to believe. That is not a matter of refutation by logic  or experience, but of explanation. If Mach were alive today I expect  he would have accepted the existence of atoms once he saw them  through a microscope, behaving according to atomic theory. As a matter  of logic, it would still be open to him to say, ‘I’m not seeing atoms, I’m  only seeing a video monitor. And I’m only seeing that theory’s predict- ions  about me , not about atoms, come true.’ But the fact that that is a  general-purpose bad explanation would be borne in upon him. It would  also be open to him to say, ‘Very well, atoms do exist, but electrons do  not.’ But he might well tire of that game if a better one seems to be  available – that is to say, if rapid progress is made. And then he would  soon realize that it is not a game. Bad philosophy is philosophy that denies the possibility, desirability  or existence of progress. And progress is the only effective way of  opposing bad philosophy. If progress cannot continue indefinitely, bad  philosophy will inevitably come again into the ascendancy – for it will  be true. terminology Bad philosophy   Philosophy that actively prevents the growth of  knowledge.

Cold, dark and empty. That unimaginably desolate environment is  typical of the universe – and is another measure of how  un typical the  Earth and its chemical scum are, in a straightforward physical sense.  48 the beginning of infinity The issue of the cosmic significance of this type of scum will shortly  take us back out into intergalactic space. But let me first return to  Earth, and consider the Spaceship Earth metaphor, in  its  straightforward  physical version.  This much is true: if, tomorrow, physical conditions on the Earth’s  surface were to change even slightly by astrophysical standards, then  no humans could live here unprotected, just as they could not survive  on a spaceship whose life-support system had broken down. Yet I am  writing this in Oxford, England, where winter nights are likewise often  cold enough to kill any human unprotected by clothing and other  technology. So, while intergalactic space would kill me in a matter of  seconds, Oxfordshire in its primeval state might do it in a matter of  hours – which can be considered ‘life support’ only in the most contrived  sense. There  is  a life-support system in Oxfordshire today, but it was  not provided by the biosphere. It has been built by humans. It consists  of clothes, houses, farms, hospitals, an electrical grid, a sewage system  and so on. Nearly the whole of the Earth’s biosphere in its primeval  state was likewise incapable of keeping an unprotected human alive  for long. It would be much more accurate to call it a death trap for  humans rather than a life-support system. Even the Great Rift Valley  in eastern Africa, where our species evolved, was barely more hospitable  than primeval Oxfordshire. Unlike the life-support system in that  imagined spaceship, the Great Rift Valley lacked a safe water supply,  and medical equipment, and comfortable living quarters, and was  infested with predators, parasites and disease organisms. It frequently  injured, poisoned, drenched, starved and sickened its ‘passengers’, and  most of them died as a result.  It was similarly harsh to all the other organisms that lived there:    few individuals live comfortably or die of old age in the supposedly  beneficent biosphere. That is no accident: most populations, of most  species, are living close to the edge of disaster and death. It has to be  that way, because as soon as some small group, somewhere, begins to  have a slightly easier life than that, for any reason – for instance, an  increased food supply, or the extinction of a competitor or predator –  then its numbers increase. As a result, its other resources are depleted  by the increased usage; so an increasing proportion of the population  now has to colonize more marginal habitats and make do with inferior  49 The Spark resources, and so on. This process continues until the disadvantages  caused by the increased population have exactly balanced the advantage  conferred by the beneficial change. That is to say, the new birth rate is  again just barely keeping pace with the rampant disabling and killing  of individuals by starvation, exhaustion, predation, overcrowding and  all those other natural processes. That is the situation to which evolution adapts organisms. And that,  therefore, is the lifestyle in which the Earth’s biosphere ‘seems adapted’  to sustaining them. The biosphere only ever achieves stability – and  only temporarily at that – by continually neglecting, harming, disabling  and killing individuals. Hence the metaphor of a spaceship or a life- support system, is quite perverse: when humans design a life-support  system, they design it to provide the maximum possible comfort, safety  and longevity for its users within the available resources; the biosphere  has no such priorities.  Nor is the biosphere a great preserver of  species . In addition to being  notoriously cruel to individuals, evolution involves continual extinctions  of entire species. The average rate of extinction since the beginning of  life on Earth has been about ten species per year (the number is known  only very approximately), becoming much higher during the relatively  brief periods that palaeontologists call ‘mass extinction events’. The  rate at which species have come into existence has on balance only  slightly exceeded the extinction rate, and the net effect is that the  overwhelming majority of species that have ever existed on Earth  (perhaps 99.9 per cent of them) are now extinct. Genetic evidence  suggests that our own species narrowly escaped extinction on at least  one occasion. Several species closely related to ours did become extinct.

the student’s much easier, because to a human  observer each different way of putting the idea would convey additional  knowledge. Alternatively, suppose that the lecturer had consistently  misspoken in a way that altered the meaning, and had then made one  correction at the end. The parrot would copy the wrong version. The  student would not. Even if the lecturer never corrected the error at all,  a human listener might still have a good chance of understanding the  410 the beginning of infinity idea that was in the lecturer’s mind – and, again, without imitating any  behaviour. If someone else reported the lecture but in a way that  contained severe misconceptions, a human listener might  still  be able  to detect what the lecturer meant, by explaining the reporter’s miscon- ceptions as well as the lecturer’s intention – just as a conjuring expert  might be able to detect what really happened during a trick given only  a false account from the audience of what they saw. Rather than imitating behaviour, a human being tries to explain it  – to understand the ideas that caused it – which is a special case of the  general human objective of explaining the world. When we succeed in  explaining someone’s behaviour, and we approve of the underlying  intention, we may subsequently behave ‘like’ that person in the relevant  sense. But if we disapprove, we might behave unlike that person. Since  creating explanations is second nature (or, rather, first nature) to us,  we can easily misconstrue the process of acquiring a meme as ‘imitating  what we see’. Using our explanations, we ‘see’ right through the be    - haviour to the meaning. Parrots copy distinctive sounds; apes copy  purposeful movements of a certain limited class. But humans do not  especially copy any behaviour. They use conjecture, criticism and  experiment to create good explanations of the meaning of things – other  people’s behaviour, their own, and that of the world in general. That  is what creativity does. And if we end up behaving like other people,  it is because we have rediscovered the same idea. That is why the audience at a lecture, when striving to assimilate the  lecturer’s memes, are not tempted to face the rear wall of the lecture  room, or to imitate the lecturer in any one of infinitely many other  ways. They reject such interpretations of what is worth copying about  the lecturer not because they are genetically incapable of conceiving    of them, as other animals are, but because they are bad explanations  of what the lecturer is doing, and bad ideas by the audience’s own  values. Both puzzles have the same solution In this chapter I have presented two puzzles. The first is why human  creativity was evolutionarily advantageous at a time when there was  almost no innovation. The second is how human memes can possibly  411 The Evolution of Creativity be replicated, given that they have content that the recipient never  observes. I think that both those puzzles have the same solution: what replicates  human memes is creativity; and creativity was used, while it was  evolving,  to replicate memes . In other words, it was used to acquire  existing knowledge, not to create new knowledge. But  the mechanism  to do both things is identical , and so in acquiring the ability to do  the former, we automatically became able to do the latter. It was a  momentous example of reach, which made possible everything that is  uniquely human. A person acquiring a meme faces the same logical challenge as a  scientist. Both must discover a hidden explanation. For the former, it  is an idea in the minds of other people; for the latter, a regularity or  law of nature. Neither person has direct access to this explanation. But  both have access to evidence with which explanations can be tested:  the observed behaviour of people who hold the meme, and physical  phenomena conforming to the law.  The puzzle of how one can possibly translate behaviour back into a  theory that contains its meaning is therefore the same puzzle as where  scientific knowledge comes from. And the idea that memes are copied  by imitating their holders’ behaviour is the same mistake as empiricism  or inductivism or Lamarckism. They all depend on there being a way  of automatically translating  problems  (like the problem of planetary  motions, or of how to reach leaves on tall trees or to be invisible to    one’s prey) into their solutions. In other words, they assume that the  environment (in the form of an observed phenomenon, or a tall tree,  say) can ‘instruct’ minds or genomes in how to meet its challenges.  Popper wrote: The inductivist or Lamarckian approach operates with the idea of  instruction from without, or from the environment. But the critical or  Darwinian approach only allows instruction from within – from within  the structure itself . . . I contend that there is no such thing as instruction from without the======================================================== that, if children fear  it, they will grow up to make  their  children fear it, then the behaviour  of telling stories about that type of hobgoblin is a meme. Suppose it  is a rational meme. Then criticism, over generations, will cast doubt  on the story’s truth. Since in reality there are no hobgoblins, the meme  might evolve away to extinction. Note that it does not ‘care’ if it goes  extinct. Memes do what they have to do: they have no intentions, even  about themselves. But there are also other paths that it might evolve  down. It might become overtly fictional. Because rational memes must  be seen as beneficial by the holders, those that evoke unpleasant  emotions are at a disadvantage, so it may also evolve away from  evoking terror and towards, for instance, being pleasantly thrilling – or  else (if it settled on a genuine danger) exploring practicalities for the  present and optimism for the future. Now suppose it is an anti-rational meme. Evoking unpleasant  emotions will then be useful in doing the harm that it needs to do –  namely disabling the listener’s ability to be rid of the hobgoblin and  entrenching the compulsion to think and therefore speak of it. The  more accurately the hobgoblin’s attributes exploit genuine, widespread  vulnerabilities of the human mind, the more faithfully the anti-rational  meme will propagate. If the meme is to survive for many generations,  it is essential that its implicit knowledge of these vulnerabilities be  true and deep. But its overt content – the idea of the hobgoblin’s  existence – need contain no truth. On the contrary, the non-existence  of the hobgoblin helps to make the meme a better replicator, be            -  cause the story is then unconstrained by the mundane attributes of    any genuine menace, which are always finite and to some degree  combatable. And that will be all the more so if the story can also  manage to undermine the principle of optimism. Thus, just as rational  memes evolve towards deep truths, anti-rational memes evolve away  from them. As usual, mixing the above two replication strategies does no good.  If a meme contains true and beneficial knowledge for the recipient, but  disables the recipient’s critical faculties in regard to itself, then the  recipient will be less able to correct errors in that knowledge, and so  will reduce the faithfulness of transmission. And if a meme relies on  the recipients’ belief that it is beneficial, but it is not in fact beneficial,  390 the beginning of infinity then that increases the chance that the recipient will reject it or refuse  to enact it. Similarly, a rational meme’s natural home is a dynamic society – more  or less any dynamic society – because there the tradition of criticism  (optimistically directed at problem-solving) will suppress variants of  the meme with even slightly less truth. Moreover, the rapid progress  will subject these variants to continually varying criteria of criticism,  which again only deeply true memes have a chance of surviving. An  anti-rational meme’s natural home is a static society – not any static  society, but preferably the one in which it evolved – for all the converse  reasons. And therefore each type of meme, when present in a society  that is broadly of the  opposite  kind, is less able to cause itself to be  replicated. The Enlightenment Our society in the West became dynamic not through the sudden failure  of a static society, but through generations of static-society-type evo  - lution. Where and when the transition began is not very well defined,  but I suspect that it began with the philosophy of Galileo and perhaps  became irreversible with the discoveries of Newton. In meme terms,  Newton’s laws replicated themselves as rational memes, and their  fidelity was very high – because they were so useful for so many  purposes. This success made it increasingly difficult to ignore the  philosophical implications of the fact that nature had been understood  in unprecedented depth, and of the methods of science and reason by  which this had been achieved. In any case, following Newton, there was no way of missing the fact  that rapid progress was under way. (Some philosophers, notably Jean- Jacques Rousseau, did try – but only by arguing that reason was  harmful, civilization bad and primitive life happy.) There was such an  avalanche of further improvements – scientific, philosophical and  political – that the possibility of resuming stasis was swept away.  Western society would become the beginning of infinity or be destroyed.  Nations beyond the West today are also changing rapidly, sometimes  through the exigencies of warfare with their neighbours, but more  often and even more powerfully by the peaceful transmission of Western  391 The Evolution of Culture memes. Their cultures, too, cannot become static again. They must  either become ‘Western’ in their mode of operation or lose all their  knowledge and thus cease to exist – a dilemma which is======================================================== in evidence. We happened to get round to  testing Newton’s laws in the seventeenth century, and Einstein’s in the  twentieth, but the evidence with which we did that – light from the  sky – had been deluging the surface of the Earth for billions of years  before that, and will continue to do so for billions more. Even today  we have barely begun to examine that evidence: on any clear night,  the chances are that your roof will be struck by evidence falling from  the sky which, if you only knew what to look for and how, would    win you a Nobel prize. In chemistry, every stable element that exists  62 the beginning of infinity anywhere is also present on or just below the Earth’s surface. In biology,  copious evidence of the nature of life is ubiquitous in the biosphere  – and within arm’s reach, in our own DNA. As far as we know,    all the fundamental constants of nature can be measured here, and    every fundamental law can be tested here. Everything needed for the    open-ended creation of knowledge is here in abundance, in the Earth’s  biosphere.  And the same is true of the moon. It has essentially the same resources  of mass, energy and evidence as the Earth has. Parochial details differ,  but the fact that humans living on the moon will have to make their  own air is no more significant than the fact that laboratories on Earth  have to make their own vacuum. Both tasks can be automated so as to  require arbitrarily little human effort or attention. Likewise, because  humans are universal constructors,  every  problem of finding or trans- form    ing resources can be no more than a transient factor limiting the  creation of knowledge in a given environment. And therefore matter,  energy and evidence are the only requirements that an environment  needs to have in order to be a venue for open-ended knowledge creation. Though any particular problem is a transient factor, the condition  of having to solve problems in order to survive and continue to create  knowledge is permanent. I have mentioned that there has never been  an unproblematic time for humans; that applies as much to the future  as to the past. Today on Earth, in the short run, there are still countless  problems to be solved to eliminate even starvation and other forms of  extreme human suffering that date back to prehistory. On a timescale  of decades, we shall be faced with choices to make substantial modifi- cations to the biosphere, or to keep it the same, or anything in between.  Whichever option we choose, it will be a project of planet-wide control,  requiring the creation of a great deal of scientific and tech  nological  knowledge as well as knowledge about how to make such decisions  rationally (see Chapter 13). In the even longer run, it is not only our  comfort and aesthetic sensibilities, and the suffering of individ  uals,  that are problematic, but, as always, the survival of our species. For  instance, at present during any given century there is about one chance  in a thousand that the Earth will be struck by a comet or asteroid large  enough to kill at least a substantial proportion of all human beings.  That means that a typical child born in the United States today is more  63 The Spark likely to die as a result of an astronomical event than a car accident.  Both are very low-probability events, but, unless we create a great deal  more scientific and technological knowledge than we have now, we  shall have no defence against those and other forms of natural disaster  that must, eventually, strike. Arguably there are more immediate  existential threats too – see Chapter 9. Setting up self-sufficient colonies on the moon and elsewhere in the  solar system – and eventually in other solar systems – will be a good  hedge against the extinction of our species or the destruction of civil- ization, and is a highly desirable goal for that reason among others.  As Hawking has said: I don’t think the human race will survive the next thousand years, unless  we spread into space. There are too many accidents that can befall life  on a single planet. But I’m an optimist. We will reach out to the stars. Daily Telegraph , 16 October 2001 But even that will be far from an unproblematic state. And most people  are not satisfied merely to be confident in the survival of the  species :  they want to survive personally. Also, like our earliest human ancestors,  they want to be free from physical danger and suffering. In future, as  various causes of suffering and death such as disease and ageing are  successively addressed and eliminated, and human life spans increase,  people will care about ever longer-term risks.  In fact people will always want still more than that: they will want  to make progress. For, in addition to threats, there will always be  problems in the benign sense of the word: errors, gaps, inconsistencies  and inadequacies in our knowledge that we wish to solve – including,  not least, moral knowledge: knowledge about======================================================== so the only constraint on the  imaginary laws of physics is that they be consistent. It is  because  of  the requirement that they be consistent that they are counter-intuitive:  intuitions about infinity are often illogical. It is a bit awkward to have to keep changing rooms – though they  are all identical and are freshly made up every time a guest moves in.  But guests love staying at Infinity Hotel. That is because it is cheap –  only a dollar a night – yet extraordinarily luxurious. How is that  possible? Every day, when the management receive all the room rents  of one dollar per room, they spend the income as follows. With the  dollars they received from the rooms numbered 1 to 1000, they buy  complimentary champagne, strawberries, housekeeping services and  all the other overheads,  just for room 1 . With the dollars they received  from the rooms numbered 1001 to 2000, they do the same for room  2, and so on. In this way, each room receives several hundred dollars’  worth of goods and services every day, and the management make a  profit as well, all from their income of one dollar per room. Word gets around, and one day an infinitely long train pulls up at  the local station, containing infinitely many people wanting to stay at  the hotel. Making infinitely many public-address announcements would  take too long (and, anyway, the hotel rules say that each guest can be  asked to perform only a finite number of actions per day), but no  matter. The management merely announce, ‘Will all guests please move  immediately to the room whose number is double that of their current  room.’ Obviously they can all do that, and afterwards the only occupied  rooms are the even numbered ones, leaving the odd-numbered ones  free for the new arrivals. That is exactly enough to receive the infinitely  many new guests, because there are exactly as many odd numbers as  there are natural numbers, as illustrated overleaf: 170 the beginning of infinity There are exactly as many odd numbers as there are natural numbers. So the first new arrival goes to room 1, the second to room 3, and so  on. Then, one day, an  infinite number  of infinitely long trains arrive at  the station, all full of guests for the hotel. But the managers are still  unperturbed. They just make a slightly more complicated announce- ment, which readers who are familiar with mathematical terminology  can see in this footnote.* The upshot is: everyone is accommodated. However, it  is  mathematically possible to overwhelm the capacity  of Infinity Hotel. In a remarkable series of discoveries in the 1870s,  Cantor proved, among other things, that not all infinities are equal. In  particular, the infinity of the continuum – the number of points in a  finite line (which is the same as the number of points in the whole of  space or spacetime) – is much larger than the infinity of the natural  numbers. Cantor proved this by proving that there can be no one-to- one correspondence between the natural numbers and the points in a  line: that set of points has a higher order of infinity than the set of  natural numbers. Here is a version of his proof – known as the  diagonal argument.  Imagine a one-centimetre-thick pack of cards, each one so thin that  there is one of them for every ‘real number’ of centimetres between 0  and 1. Real numbers can be defined as the decimal numbers between  those limits, such as 0.7071. . ., where the ellipsis again denotes a  continuation that may be infinitely long. It is impossible to deal out  *First, they announce to the existing guests, ‘For each natural number  N , will the guest  in room number  N  please move immediately to room number  N ( N  +   1)/2.’ Then they  announce, ‘For all natural numbers  N  and  M , will the  N th passenger from the  M th  train please go to room number [( N  +  M ) 2   +  N  –  M ]/2.’ 171 A Window on Infinity one of these cards to each room of Infinity Hotel. For suppose that the  cards  were  so distributed. We can prove that this entails a contradiction.  It would mean that cards had been assigned to rooms in something  like the manner of the table below. (The particular numbers illustrated  are not significant: we are going to prove that real numbers cannot be  assigned in  any  order.) Cantor’s diagonal argument Look at the infinite sequence of digits highlighted in bold – namely  ‘  . . .’. Then consider a decimal number constructed as follows: it  starts with zero followed by a decimal point, and continues arbitrarily,  except that each of its digits must differ from the corresponding digit  in the infinite sequence ‘  . . .’. For instance, we could choose a  number such as ‘0.5885. . .’. The card with the number thus constructed  cannot have been assigned to any room. For it differs in its first digit  from that of the card assigned to room 1, and in its second digit from  that of the card assigned to room 2, and so on. Thus it differs from all  the cards that have been assigned======================================================== then interpret  those elements as being connected by the logic of a larger sentence or  program. Similarly, in behaviour parsing (which evolved millions of  years before human language parsing), an ape parses a continuous  stream of behaviour that it witnesses into individual elements, each of  which it already knows – genetically – how to imitate. The individual  408 the beginning of infinity elements can be inborn behaviours, such as biting; or behaviours  learned by trial and error, such as grasping a nettle without being stung;  or previously learned memes. As for connecting these elements together  in the right way without knowing why, it turns out that, in every known  case of complex behaviours in non-humans, the necessary information  can be obtained merely by watching the behaviour many times and  looking out for simple statistical patterns – such as which right-hand  behaviour often goes with which left-hand behaviour, and which  elements are often omitted. It is a very inefficient method, requiring a  lot of watching of behaviours that a human could mimic almost  immediately by understanding their purpose. Also, it allows only a few  fixed options for connecting the behaviours together, so only relatively  simple memes can be replicated. Apes can copy certain individual  actions instantly – the ones of which they have pre-existing knowledge  through their mirror-neuron system – but it takes them years to learn  a repertoire of memes that involve combinations of actions. Yet those  memes – trivially simple tricks by human standards – are enormously  valuable: using them, apes have privileged access to sources of food  that are closed to all other animals; and meme evolution gives them  the ability to switch to other sources far faster than gene evolution  would allow.  So, an ape knows (inexplicitly) that another ape is ‘picking up a  rock’, and not performing any of the countless other possible inter- pretations of the same actions, such as ‘picking up an object in a given  relative position’, because picking up a rock is in its inborn repertoire  of copiable behaviours while the other possibilities are not. Indeed, it  may well be that apes  cannot  imitate the behaviour of ‘picking up an  object in a given relative position’. Note, in this connection, that apes  are unable to imitate sounds. They cannot even parrot sounds (repeat  them blindly), despite having a complex inborn repertoire of calls that  they can make, recognize and act upon in genetically predetermined  ways. Their behaviour-parsing system simply did not evolve a pre  - determined translation mechanism from hearing sounds to uttering  them, so they cannot ape them. Consequently there are no customized  sounds in any of the apes’ memetically controlled behaviours. Thus, in the crucial respect that is relevant to meme replication,  aping has the same logic as parroting: like the parrot, the ape avoids  409 The Evolution of Creativity the infinite ambiguity of copying by already knowing, inexplicitly, the  meaning of every action that it is capable of copying. And it is only  capable of associating one meaning with each action that it can copy  – one definition of how to perform the ‘same’ action under various  circumstances. That is how ape memes can be replicated without the  impossible step of literally copying knowledge from another ape. The  recipient of the meme instantly recognizes the meaning of each element  of the behaviour; and it relates the elements by statistical analysis, not  by discovering how they support each other’s functioning.  Human beings acquiring human memes are doing something pro  - foundly different. When an audience is watching a lecture, or a child  is learning language, their problem is almost the opposite of that of  parroting or aping: the meaning of the behaviour that they are observ- ing is precisely what they are striving to discover and do not know in  advance. The actions themselves, and even the logic of how they are  connected, are largely secondary and are often entirely forgotten  afterwards. For example, as adults we remember few of the actual  sentences from which we learned to speak. If a parrot had copied  snatches of Popper’s voice at a lecture, it would certainly have copied  them with his Austrian accent: parrots are incapable of copying an  utterance without its accent. But a human student might well be unable  to copy it  with  the accent. In fact a student might well acquire a  complex meme at a lecture without being able to repeat a single  sentence spoken by the lecturer, even immediately afterwards. In such  a case the student has replicated the meaning – which is the whole  content – of the meme without imitating any actions at all. As I said,  imitation is not at the heart of human meme replication. Suppose that the lecturer had repeatedly returned to a certain key  idea, and had expressed it with different words and gestures each time.  The parrot’s (or ape’s) job would be======================================================== that seems strange, imagine, for  the sake of argument, that a historian were to discover that Einstein  wrote his papers only as a joke, or at gunpoint, and was actually a  lifelong believer in Kepler’s laws. This would be a bizarre and important  discovery about the  history  of physics, and all the textbooks about  that would have to be rewritten. But our knowledge of physics itself  would be unaffected, and physics textbooks would not need any change  at all. The second half of the answer is that the reason why the scientists  257 A Dream of Socrates are trying to learn the theory, and also why they have such disregard  for faithfulness to the original, is that they want to know how the  world is. Crucially, this is the same objective that the originator of the  theory had. If it is a good theory – if it is a superb theory, as the  fundamental theories of physics nowadays are – then it is exceedingly  hard to vary while still remaining a viable explanation. So the learners,  through criticism of their initial guesses and with the help of their  books, teachers and colleagues, seeking a viable explanation, will arrive  at the same theory as the originator.  That  is how the theory manages  to be passed faithfully from generation to generation, despite no one  caring about its faithfulness one way or the other.  Slowly, and with many setbacks, the same is becoming true in  non-scientific fields. The way to converge with each other is to converge  upon the truth. 258 11 The Multiverse The idea of a ‘doppelgänger’ (a ‘double’ of a person) is a frequent theme  of science fiction. For instance, the classic television series  Star Trek   featured several types of doppelgänger story involving malfunctions  of the ‘transporter’, the starship’s teleportation device, normally used  for short-range space travel. Since teleporting something is conceptually  similar to making a copy of it at a different location, one can imagine  various ways in which the process could go wrong and somehow end  up with two instances of each passenger – the original and the copy. Stories vary in how similar the  doppelgänger s are to their originals.  To share literally all their attributes, they would have to be at exactly  the same location as well as looking alike. But what would that mean?  Trying to make atoms coincide leads to some problematic physics – for  instance, two coinciding nuclei are liable to combine to form atoms of  heavier chemical elements. And if two identical human bodies were to  coincide even approximately, they would explode simply because water  at double its normal density exerts a pressure of hundreds of thousands  of atmospheres. In fiction one could imagine different laws of physics  to avoid those problems; but, even then, if the  doppelgänger s continued  to coincide with their originals throughout the story, it would not really  be about  doppelgänger s. Sooner or later they have to be different.  Sometimes they are the good and evil ‘sides’ of the same person;  sometimes they start with identical minds but become increasingly  different through having different experiences.  Sometimes a  doppelgänger  is not  copied  from an original, but exists  from the outset in a ‘parallel universe’. In some stories there is a ‘rift’  between universes through which one can communicate or even travel  to meet one’s  doppelgänger . In others, the universes remain mutually  259 The Multiverse imperceptible, in which case the interest of the story (or, rather, two  stories) is in how events are affected by the differences between them.  For instance, the movie  Sliding Doors  interleaves two variants of a  love story, following the fortunes of two instances of the same couple  in two universes which initially differ only in one small detail. In a  related genre, known as ‘alternative history’, one of the two stories  need not be told explicitly because it is a part of our own history and  is assumed to be known to the audience. For example, the novel  Fatherland,  by Robert Harris, is about a universe in which Germany  won the Second World War; Robert Silverberg’s  Roma Eterna  is about  one in which the Roman Empire did not fall. In another class of stories, the transporter’s malfunction accidentally  exiles the passengers to a ‘phantom zone’ where they are imperceptible  to everyone in the ordinary world, but can see and hear them (and each  other). So they have the distressing experience of yelling and gesticulating  in vain to their shipmates, who are oblivious and walk right through  them.  In some stories it is only  copies  of the travellers that are sent to a  phantom zone, unbeknown to the originals. Such a story may end with  the exiles discovering that they can, after all, have some effect on the  ordinary world. They use that effect to signal their existence, and are  rescued through a reversal of the process that exiled them. Depending  on the fictional science that has been supposed, they then may======================================================== alism, anthropocentrism and studied ambiguity, used to avoid  understanding quantum theory as being about reality. 325 A Physicist’s History of Bad Philosophy Positivism   The bad philosophy that everything not ‘derived from  observation’ should be eliminated from science.

With the Enlightenment came much more  good philosophy, but bad philosophy became much worse, with the  descent from empiricism (merely false) to positivism, logical positivism,  instrumentalism, Wittgenstein, linguistic philosophy, and the ‘post- modernist’ and related movements. In science, the main impact of bad philosophy has been through the  idea of separating a scientific theory into (explanationless) predictions  and (arbitrary) interpretation. This has helped to legitimize de    -  humanizing explanations of human thought and behaviour. In quantum  theory, bad philosophy manifested itself mainly as the Copenhagen  interpretation and its many variants, and as the ‘shut-up-and-calculate’  interpretation. These appealed to doctrines such as logical positivism  to justify systematic equivocation and to immunize themselves from  criticism. 326 13 Choices In March 1792 George Washington exercised the first presidential veto  in the history of the United States of America. Unless you already know  what he and Congress were quarrelling about, I doubt that you will  be able to guess, yet the issue remains controversial to this day. With  hindsight, one may even perceive a certain inevitability in it, for, as I  shall explain, it is rooted in a far-reaching misconception about the  nature of human choice, which is still prevalent.  On the face of it, the issue seems no more than a technicality:  in the  US House of Representatives, how many seats should each state be  allotted?  This is known as the  apportionment problem , because the US  Constitution requires seats to be ‘apportioned among the several States  . . . according to their respective Numbers [i.e. their populations]’. So, if  your state contained 1 per cent of the US population, it would be entitled  to 1 per cent of the seats in the House. This was intended to implement  the principle of  representative government  – that the legislature should  represent the people. It was, after all, about the House of Representatives.  (The US Senate, in contrast, represents the  states  of the Union, and hence  each state, regardless of population, has two senators.)  At present there are 435 seats in the House of Representatives; so,  if 1 per cent of the US population did live in your state, then by strict  proportionality the number of representatives to which it would be  entitled – known as its  quota  – would be 4.35. When the quotas are  not whole numbers, which of course they hardly ever are, they have  to be rounded somehow. The method of rounding is known as an  apportionment rule . The Constitution did not specify an apportionment  rule; it left such details to Congress, and that is where the centuries of  controversy began.  327 Choices An apportionment rule is said to ‘stay within the quota’ if the number  of seats that it allocates to each state never differs from the state’s  quota by as much as a whole seat. For instance, if a state’s quota is  4.35 seats, then to ‘stay within the quota’ a rule must assign that state  either four seats or five. It may take all sorts of information into account  in choosing between four and five, but if it is capable of assigning any  other number it is said to ‘violate quota’.  When one first hears of the apportionment problem, compromises  that seem to solve it at a stroke spring easily to mind. Everyone asks,  ‘Why couldn’t they just . . . ?’ Here is what I asked: Why couldn’t they  just round each state’s quota to the nearest whole number? Under that  rule, a quota of 4.35 seats would be rounded down to four; 4.6 seats  would be rounded up to five. It seemed to me that, since this sort of  rounding can never add or subtract more than  half  a seat, it would  keep each state within half a seat of its quota, thus ‘staying within the  quota’ with room to spare. I was wrong: my rule violates quota. This is easy to demonstrate by  applying it to an imaginary House of Representatives with ten seats,  in a nation of four states. Suppose that one of the states has just under  85 per cent of the total population, and the other three have just over  5 per cent each. The large state therefore has a quota of just under 8.5,  which my rule rounds down to eight. Each of the three small states  has a quota of just over half a seat, which my rule rounds up to one.  But now we have allocated eleven seats, not ten. In itself that hardly  matters: the======================================================== often  do this  by imparting useful functionality to their organism, and in those cases  *This terminology differs slightly from that of Dawkins. Anything that is copied,    for whatever reason, he calls a replicator. What I call a replicator he calls an ‘active    replicator’. 94 the beginning of infinity their knowledge incidentally includes knowledge about that functionality.  Functionality, in turn, is achieved by encoding, into genes, regularities  in the environment and sometimes even rule-of-thumb approximations  to laws of nature, in which case the genes are incidentally encoding that  knowledge too. But the core of the explanation for the presence of a  gene is always that it got itself replicated more than its rival genes. Non-explanatory human knowledge can also evolve in an analogous  way: rules of thumb are not passed on perfectly to the next generation  of users, and the ones that survive in the long run are not necessarily  the ones that optimize the ostensible function. For instance, a rule that  is expressed in an elegant rhyme may be remembered, and repeated,  better than one that is more accurate but expressed in ungainly prose.  Also, no human knowledge is entirely non-explanatory. There is always  at least a background of assumptions about reality against which the  meaning of a rule of thumb is understood, and that background can  make some false rules of thumb seem plausible. Explanatory theories evolve through a more complicated mechanism.  Accidental errors in transmission and memory still play a role, but a  much smaller one. That is because good explanations are hard to vary  even without being tested, and hence random errors in the transmission  of a good explanation are easier for the receiver to detect and correct.  The most important source of variation in explanatory theories is  creativity. For instance, when people are trying to understand an idea  that they hear from others, they typically understand it to mean what  makes most sense to them, or what they are most expecting to hear,  or what they fear to hear, and so on. Those meanings are conjectured  by the listener or reader, and may differ from what the speaker or  writer intended. In addition, people often try to improve explanations  even when they have received them accurately: they make creative  amendments, spurred by their own criticism. If they then pass the  explanation on to others, they usually try to pass on what they consider  to be the improved version. Unlike genes, many memes take different physical forms every time  they are replicated. People rarely express ideas in exactly the same  words in which they heard them. They also translate from one language  to another, and between spoken and written language, and so on. Yet  we rightly call what is transmitted the  same  idea – the same meme –  95 Creation throughout. Thus, in the case of most memes, the real replicator is  abstract: it is the knowledge itself. This is in principle true of genes as  well: biotechnology routinely transcribes genes into the memories of  computers, where they are stored in a different physical form. Those  records could be translated back into DNA strands and implanted in  different animals. The only reason this is not yet a common practice  is that it is easier to copy the original gene. But one day the genes of a  rare species could survive its extinction by causing themselves to be  stored on a computer and then implanted into a cell of a different  species. I say ‘causing themselves to be stored’ because the biotech- nologists would not be recording information indiscriminately, but  only information that met a criterion such as ‘gene of an endangered  species’. The ability to interest biotechnologists in this way would then  be part of the reach of the knowledge in those genes.  So, both human knowledge and biological adaptations are abstract  replicators: forms of information which, once they are embodied in a  suitable physical system, tend to remain so while most variants of them  do not. The fact that the principles of neo-Darwinist theory are, from a  certain perspective, self-evident has itself been used as a criticism of  the theory. For instance, if the theory  must  be true, how can it be  testable? One reply, often attributed to Haldane, is that the whole  theory would be refuted by the discovery of a single fossilized rabbit  in a stratum of Cambrian rock. However, that is misleading. The import  of such an observation would depend on what explanations were  available under the given circumstances. For instance, misidentifications  of fossils, and of strata, have sometimes been made and would have  to be ruled out by good explanations before one could call the discovery  ‘a fossilized rabbit in Cambrian rock’.  Even given such explanations, what would have been ruled out by  the rabbit would be not the theory of evolution itself, but only the  prevailing theory of the history of life and geological processes======================================================== meme generation. (Meme ‘generations’ are  simply successive instances of copying to another individual.) Tech- nology can add further stages to a meme’s life cycle. For instance, the  behaviour may be to write something down – thus embodying the  meme in a third physical form, which may later cause a person who  reads it to enact other behaviour, which then causes the meme to    appear in someone’s brain. But all memes must have at least two  physical forms. In contrast, for genes the replicator exists in only one physical form  – the DNA strand (of a germ cell). Even though it may be copied to  other locations in the organism, translated into RNA, and expressed  as behaviour, none of those forms is a replicator. The idea that the  behaviour might be a replicator is a form of Lamarckism, since it  implies that behaviours that had been modified by circumstances would  be inherited.  377 The Evolution of Culture A gene exists in only one physical form, which is copied. Because of the alternating physical forms of a meme, it has to survive  two different, and potentially unrelated, mechanisms of selection in  every generation. The brain-memory form has to cause the holder to  enact the behaviour; and the behaviour form has to cause the new  recipient to remember it – and to enact it. So, for example, although religions prescribe behaviours such as  educating one’s children to adopt the religion, the mere intention to  transmit a meme to one’s children or anyone else is quite insufficient  to make that happen. That is why the overwhelming majority of  attempts to start a new religion fail, even if the founder members try  hard to propagate it. In such cases, what has happened is that an idea  that people have adopted has succeeded in causing them to enact  various behaviours including ones intended to cause their children and  others to do the same – but the behaviour has failed to cause the same  idea to be stored in the minds of those recipients.  The existence of long-lived religions is sometimes explained from  the premise that ‘children are gullible’, or that they are ‘easily frightened’  by tales of the supernatural. But that is not the explanation. The  overwhelming majority of ideas simply do not have what it takes to  persuade (or frighten or cajole or otherwise cause) children or anyone  else into doing the same to other people. If establishing a faithfully  replicating meme were that easy, the whole adult population in our  society would be proficient at algebra, thanks to the efforts made to  378 the beginning of infinity teach it to them when they were children. To be exact, they would all  be proficient algebra  teachers . To be a meme, an idea has to contain quite sophisticated knowledge  of how to cause humans to do at least two independent things: assimi- late the meme faithfully, and enact it. That some memes can replicate  themselves with great fidelity for many generations is a token of how  much knowledge they contain.  The selfish meme If a gene is in a genome at all, then, when suitable circumstances arise,  it will definitely be expressed as an enzyme, as I described in Chapter  6, and will then cause its characteristic effects. Nor can it be left behind  if the rest of its genome is successfully replicated. But merely being  present in a mind does not automatically get a meme expressed as  behaviour: the meme has to compete for that privilege with other ideas  – memes and non-memes, about all sorts of subjects – in the same mind.  And merely being expressed as behaviour does not automatically get  the meme copied into a recipient along with other memes: it has to  compete for the recipients’ attention and acceptance with all sorts of  behaviours by other people, and with the recipient’s own ideas. All that  is in addition to the analogue of the type of selection that genes face,  each meme competing with rival versions of itself across the population,  perhaps by containing the knowledge for some useful function. Memes are subject to all sorts of random and intentional variation  in addition to all that selection, and so they evolve. So to this extent  the same logic holds as for genes: memes are ‘selfish’. They do not  necessarily evolve to benefit their holders, or their society – or, again,  even themselves, except in the sense of replicating better than other  memes. (Though now  most  other memes are their rivals, not just  variants of themselves.) The successful meme variant is the one that  changes the behaviour of its holders in such a way as to make itself  best at displacing other memes from the population. This variant may  well benefit its holders, or their culture, or the species as a whole. But  if it harms them, or destroys them, it will spread anyway. Memes that  harm society are a familiar phenomenon. You need only consider the  harm done by adherents of political views, or religions, that you  379 The Evolution of Culture especially abhor. Societies have been destroyed======================================================== forbidden by the laws  of physics (such as replanting a forest) can only be a matter of knowing  425 Unsustainable how. We know that finding out how is a matter of seeking good  explanations. We also know that whether a particular attempt to make  progress will succeed or not is profoundly unpredictable. It can be  understood in retrospect, but not in terms of factors that could have  been known in advance. Thus we now understand why alchemists never  succeeded at transmutation: because they would have had to understand  some nuclear physics first. But this could not have been known at the  time. And the progress that they did make – which led to the science  of chemistry – depended strongly on how individual alchemists  thought ,  and only peripherally on factors like which chemicals could be found  nearby. The conditions for a beginning of infinity exist in almost every  human habitation on Earth. In his book  Guns, Germs and Steel , the biogeographer Jared Diamond  takes the opposite view. He proposes what he calls an ‘ultimate ex    - planation’ of why human history was so different on different con  - tinents. In particular, he seeks to explain why it was Europeans who  sailed out to conquer the Americas, Australasia and Africa and not vice  versa. In Diamond’s view, the psychology and philosophy and politics  of historical events are no more than ephemeral ripples on the great  river of history. Its course is set by factors independent of human ideas  and decisions. Specifically, he says, the continents on our planet had  different natural resources – different geographies, plants, animals and  micro-organisms – and, details aside, that is what explains the broad  sweep of history, including which human ideas were created and what  decisions were made, politics, philosophy, cutlery and all. For example, part of his explanation of why the Americas never  developed a technological civilization before the advent of Europeans  is that there were no animals there suitable for domestication as beasts  of burden. Llamas are native to South America, and have been used as beasts of  burden since prehistoric times, so Diamond points out that they are  not native to the continent as a whole, but only to the Andes mountains.  Why did no technological civilization arise in the Andes mountains?  Why did the Incan Empire not have an Enlightenment? Diamond’s  position is that other biogeographical factors were unfavourable.  The communist thinker Friedrich Engels proposed the same ultimate  426 the beginning of infinity explanation of history, and made the same proviso about llamas,    in 1884: The Eastern Hemisphere . . . possessed nearly all the animals adaptable  to domestication . . . The Western Hemisphere, America, had no mammals  that could be domesticated except the llama, which, moreover, was only  found in one part of South America . . . Owing to these differences in  natural conditions, the population of each hemisphere now goes on its  own way . . . The Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State (Friedrich Engels, based on notes by Karl Marx) But why did llamas  continue  to be ‘only found in one part of South  America’, if they could have been useful elsewhere? Engels did not  address that issue. But Diamond realized that it ‘cries out for explan- ation’. Because, unless the reason that llamas were not exported was  itself biogeographical, Diamond’s ‘ultimate explanation’ is false. So he  proposed a biogeographical reason: he pointed out that a hot, lowland  region, unsuitable for llamas, separates the Andes from the highlands  of Central America where llamas would have been useful in agriculture. But, again,  why  must such a region have been a barrier to the spread  of domesticated llamas? Traders travelled between South and Central  America for centuries, perhaps overland and certainly by sea. Where  there are long-range traders, it is not necessary for an idea to be useful  in an unbroken line of places for it to be able to spread. As I remarked  in Chapter 11, knowledge has the unique ability to take aim at a distant  427 Unsustainable target and utterly transform it while having scarcely any effect on the  space between. So, what would it have taken for some of those traders  to take some llamas north for sale? Only the idea: the leap of imagin- ation to guess that if something is useful here, it might be useful there  too. And the boldness to take the speculative and physical risk.  Polynesian traders did exactly that. They ranged further, across a more  formidable natural barrier, carrying goods including livestock. Why  did none of the South American traders ever think of selling llamas to  the Central Americans? We may never know – but why should it have  had anything to do with geography? They may simply have been too  set in their ways. Perhaps innovative uses for animals were taboo.  Perhaps such a trade was attempted, but failed every time because of  sheer bad luck. But, whatever======================================================== that much harder than imitating  only the first instance; the student’s much easier, because to a human  observer each different way of putting the idea would convey additional  knowledge. Alternatively, suppose that the lecturer had consistently  misspoken in a way that altered the meaning, and had then made one  correction at the end. The parrot would copy the wrong version. The  student would not. Even if the lecturer never corrected the error at all,  a human listener might still have a good chance of understanding the  410 the beginning of infinity idea that was in the lecturer’s mind – and, again, without imitating any  behaviour. If someone else reported the lecture but in a way that  contained severe misconceptions, a human listener might  still  be able  to detect what the lecturer meant, by explaining the reporter’s miscon- ceptions as well as the lecturer’s intention – just as a conjuring expert  might be able to detect what really happened during a trick given only  a false account from the audience of what they saw. Rather than imitating behaviour, a human being tries to explain it  – to understand the ideas that caused it – which is a special case of the  general human objective of explaining the world. When we succeed in  explaining someone’s behaviour, and we approve of the underlying  intention, we may subsequently behave ‘like’ that person in the relevant  sense. But if we disapprove, we might behave unlike that person. Since  creating explanations is second nature (or, rather, first nature) to us,  we can easily misconstrue the process of acquiring a meme as ‘imitating  what we see’. Using our explanations, we ‘see’ right through the be    - haviour to the meaning. Parrots copy distinctive sounds; apes copy  purposeful movements of a certain limited class. But humans do not  especially copy any behaviour. They use conjecture, criticism and  experiment to create good explanations of the meaning of things – other  people’s behaviour, their own, and that of the world in general. That  is what creativity does. And if we end up behaving like other people,  it is because we have rediscovered the same idea. That is why the audience at a lecture, when striving to assimilate the  lecturer’s memes, are not tempted to face the rear wall of the lecture  room, or to imitate the lecturer in any one of infinitely many other  ways. They reject such interpretations of what is worth copying about  the lecturer not because they are genetically incapable of conceiving    of them, as other animals are, but because they are bad explanations  of what the lecturer is doing, and bad ideas by the audience’s own  values. Both puzzles have the same solution In this chapter I have presented two puzzles. The first is why human  creativity was evolutionarily advantageous at a time when there was  almost no innovation. The second is how human memes can possibly  411 The Evolution of Creativity be replicated, given that they have content that the recipient never  observes. I think that both those puzzles have the same solution: what replicates  human memes is creativity; and creativity was used, while it was  evolving,  to replicate memes . In other words, it was used to acquire  existing knowledge, not to create new knowledge. But  the mechanism  to do both things is identical , and so in acquiring the ability to do  the former, we automatically became able to do the latter. It was a  momentous example of reach, which made possible everything that is  uniquely human. A person acquiring a meme faces the same logical challenge as a  scientist. Both must discover a hidden explanation. For the former, it  is an idea in the minds of other people; for the latter, a regularity or  law of nature. Neither person has direct access to this explanation. But  both have access to evidence with which explanations can be tested:  the observed behaviour of people who hold the meme, and physical  phenomena conforming to the law.  The puzzle of how one can possibly translate behaviour back into a  theory that contains its meaning is therefore the same puzzle as where  scientific knowledge comes from. And the idea that memes are copied  by imitating their holders’ behaviour is the same mistake as empiricism  or inductivism or Lamarckism. They all depend on there being a way  of automatically translating  problems  (like the problem of planetary  motions, or of how to reach leaves on tall trees or to be invisible to    one’s prey) into their solutions. In other words, they assume that the  environment (in the form of an observed phenomenon, or a tall tree,  say) can ‘instruct’ minds or genomes in how to meet its challenges.  Popper wrote: The inductivist or Lamarckian approach operates with the idea of  instruction from without, or from the environment. But the critical or  Darwinian approach only allows instruction from within – from within  the structure itself . . . I contend that there is no such thing as instruction from without the======================================================== little explanation of  any of them, I know of no plausible argument that they are at different  levels or can be achieved independently of each other. So I tentatively  assume that they cannot. In any case, we should expect AI to be  achieved in a jump to universality, starting from something much less  powerful. In contrast, the ability to imitate a human imperfectly or in  specialized functions is not a form of universality. It can exist in degrees.  Hence, even if chatbots did at some point start becoming much better  at imitating humans (or at fooling humans), that would still not be a  path to AI. Becoming better at pretending to think is not the same as  coming closer to being able to think. There is a philosophy whose basic tenet is that those  are  the  same. It is called  behaviourism  – which is instrumentalism applied to  psychology. In other words, it is the doctrine that psychology can only,  or should only, be the science of behaviour, not of minds; that it can  158 the beginning of infinity only measure and predict relationships between people’s external  circumstances (‘stimuli’) and their observed behaviours (‘responses’).  The latter is, unfortunately, exactly how the Turing test asks the judge  to regard a candidate AI. Hence it encouraged the attitude that if a  program could fake AI well enough, one would have achieved it. But  ultimately a non-AI program cannot fake AI. The path to AI cannot  be through ever better tricks for making chatbots more convincing. A behaviourist would no doubt ask: what exactly  is  the difference  between giving a chatbot a very rich repertoire of tricks, templates and  databases and giving it AI abilities? What is an AI program, other than  a collection of such tricks? When discussing Lamarckism in Chapter 4, I pointed out the funda- mental difference between a muscle becoming stronger in an individual’s  lifetime and muscles  evolving  to become stronger. For the former, the  knowledge to achieve all the available muscle strengths must already  be present in the individual’s genes before the sequence of changes  begins. (And so must the knowledge of how to recognize the circum- stances under which to make the changes.) This is exactly the analogue  of a ‘trick’ that a programmer has built into a chatbot: the chatbot  responds ‘as though’ it had created some of the knowledge while  composing its response, but in fact all the knowledge was created earlier  and elsewhere. The analogue of evolutionary change in a species is  creative thought in a person. The analogue of the idea that AI could be  achieved by an accumulation of chatbot tricks is Lamarckism, the theory  that new adaptations could be explained by changes that are in reality  just a manifestation of existing knowledge. There are several current areas of research in which that same  misconception is common. In chatbot-based AI research it sent the  whole field down a blind alley, but in other fields it has merely caused  researchers to attach overambitious labels to genuine, albeit relatively  modest, achievements. One such area is  artificial evolution . Recall Edison’s idea that progress requires alternating ‘inspiration’  and ‘perspiration’ phases, and that, because of computers and other  technology, it is increasingly becoming possible to automate the per  - spiration phase. This welcome development has misled those who    are overconfident about achieving artificial evolution (and AI). For  example, suppose that you are a graduate student in robotics, hoping  159 Artificial Creativity to build a robot that walks on legs better than previous robots do. The  first phase of the solution must involve inspiration – that is to say,  creative thought, attempting to improve upon previous researchers’  attempts to solve the same problem. You will start from that, and from  existing ideas about  other  problems that you conjecture may be related,  and from the designs of walking animals in nature. All of that constitutes  existing knowledge, which you will vary and combine in new ways,  and then subject to criticism and further variation. Eventually you will  have created a design for the hardware of your new robot: its legs with  their levers, joints, tendons and motors; its body, which will hold the  power supply; its sense organs, through which it will receive the  feedback that will allow it to control those limbs effectively; and    the computer that will exercise that control. You will have adapted  everything in that design as best you can to the purpose of walking,  except the program in the computer.  The function of that program will be to recognize situations such as  the robot beginning to topple over, or obstacles in its path, and to  calculate the appropriate action and to take it. This is the hardest part  of your research project. How does one recognize when it is best to  avoid an obstacle to the left or to the right, or jump over it or kick it  aside or ignore it, or lengthen one’s======================================================== ideas are original, and occasionally one of  them would actually help. It need be only a small, tentative improve- ment: a way of hunting or growing food with slightly less effort, or of  making slightly better tools; a better way of recording debts or laws;  a subtle change in the relationship between husband and wife, or  between parent and child; a slightly different attitude towards the  society’s rulers or gods. What will happen next?  The person with that idea may well want to tell other people. Those  who believe the idea will see that it could make life a little less nasty,  brutish and short. They will tell their families and friends, and they  theirs. This idea will be competing in people’s minds with other ideas  about how to make life better, most of them presumably false. But  suppose, for the sake of argument, that this particular true idea happens  to be believed, and spreads through the society. Then the society will have been changed. It may not have changed  very much, but this was merely the change caused by a single person,  thinking of a single idea. So multiply all that by the number of thinking  minds in the society, and by a lifetime’s worth of thought in each of  them, and let this continue for only a few generations, and the result  is an exponentially increasing, revolutionary force transforming every  aspect of the society. But in a static society that beginning of infinity never happens.  Despite the fact that I have assumed nothing other than that people  try to improve their lives, and that they cannot transmit their ideas  perfectly, and that information subject to variation and selection  evolves, I have entirely failed to imagine a static society in this story.  For a society to be static, something else must be happening as well.  One thing my story did not take into account is that static societies  have customs and laws – taboos – that prevent their memes from  changing. They enforce the enactment of the existing memes, forbid  the enactment of variants, and suppress criticism of the status quo.  However, that alone could not suppress change. First,  no  enactment  of a meme is completely identical to that of the previous generation.  It is infeasible to specify every aspect of acceptable behaviour with  382 the beginning of infinity perfect precision. Second, it is impossible to tell in advance which small  deviations from traditional behaviour would initiate further changes.  Third, once a variant idea has begun to spread to even one more person  – which means that people are preferring it – preventing it from being  transmitted further is extremely difficult. Therefore no society could  remain static solely by suppressing new ideas once they have been  created.  That is why the enforcement of the status quo is only ever a  secondary method of preventing change – a mopping-up operation.  The primary method is always – and can only be – to disable the source  of new ideas, namely human creativity. So static societies always have  traditions of bringing up children in ways that disable their creativity  and critical faculties. That ensures that most of the new ideas that  would have been capable of changing the society are never thought  of in the first place.  How is this done? The details are variable and not relevant here, but  the sort of thing that happens is that people growing up in such a  society acquire a set of values for judging themselves and everyone else  which amounts to ridding themselves of distinctive attributes and  seeking only conformity with the society’s constitutive memes. They  not only enact those memes: they see themselves as existing only in  order to enact them. So, not only do such societies enforce qualities  such as obedience, piety and devotion to duty, their members’ sense of  their own selves is invested in the same standards. People know no  others. So they feel pride and shame, and form all their aspirations and  opinions, by the criterion of how thoroughly they subordinate them- selves to the society’s memes.  How do memes ‘know’ how to achieve all such complex, reproducible  effects on the ideas and behaviour of human beings? They do not,    of course,  know : they are not sentient beings. They merely contain  that knowledge implicitly. How did they come by that knowledge? It  evolved. The memes exist, at any instant, in many variant forms, and  those are subject to selection in favour of  faithful replication . For every  long-lived meme of a static society, millions of variants of it will have  fallen by the wayside because they lacked that tiny extra piece of  information, that extra degree of ruthless efficiency in preventing    rivals from being thought of or acted upon, that slight advantage in  383 The Evolution of Culture psychological leverage, or whatever it took to make it spread through  the population better than its rivals and, once it was prevalent, to get  it copied and enacted with just that extra degree of======================================================== past and would have in  the future.  But what use are explanations if they cannot make predictions and  so cannot be tested through experience, as they can be in science? This  is really the question: how is progress possible in philosophy? As I  discussed in Chapter 5, it is obtained by seeking good explanations.  The misconception that evidence can play no legitimate role in philo- sophy is a relic of empiricism. Objective progress is indeed possible in  politics just as it is in morality generally and in science. Political philosophy traditionally centred on a collection of issues  that Popper called the ‘who should rule?’ question. Who should wield  power? Should it be a monarch or aristocrats, or priests, or a dictator,  or a small group, or ‘the people’, or their delegates? And that leads to  210 the beginning of infinity derivative questions such as ‘How should a king be educated?’ ‘Who  should be enfranchised in a democracy?’ ‘How does one ensure an  informed and responsible electorate?’ Popper pointed out that this class of questions is rooted in the same  misconception as the question ‘How are scientific theories derived from  sensory data?’ which defines empiricism. It is seeking a system that  derives  or justifies the right choice of leader or government, from  existing data – such as inherited entitlements, the opinion of the  majority, the manner in which a person has been educated, and so on.  The same misconception also underlies blind optimism and pessimism:  they both expect progress to be made by applying a simple rule to  existing knowledge, to establish which future possibilities to ignore  and which to rely on. Induction, instrumentalism and even Lamarckism  all make the same mistake: they expect  explanationless progress.  They  expect knowledge to be created by fiat with few errors, and not by a  process of variation and selection that is making a continual stream  of errors and correcting them. The defenders of hereditary monarchy doubted that any method of  selection of a leader by means of rational thought and debate could  improve upon a fixed, mechanical criterion. That was the precautionary  principle in action, and it gave rise to the usual ironies. For instance,  whenever pretenders to a throne claimed to have a better hereditary  entitlement than the incumbent, they were in effect citing the precaution- ary principle as a justification for sudden, violent, unpredictable change  – in other words, for blind optimism. The same was true whenever  monarchs happened to favour radical change themselves. Consider also  the revolutionary utopians, who typically achieve only destruction and  stagnation. Though they are blind optimists, what defines them as  utopians is their pessimism that their supposed utopia, or their violent  proposals for achieving and entrenching it, could ever be improved upon.  Additionally, they are revolutionaries in the first place because they are  pessimistic that many other people can be persuaded of the final truth  that they think they know. Ideas have consequences, and the ‘who should rule?’ approach to  political philosophy is not just a mistake of academic analysis: it has  been part of practically every bad political doctrine in history. If the  political process is seen as an engine for putting the right rulers in  211 Optimism power, then it justifies violence, for until that right system is in place,  no ruler is legitimate; and once it is in place, and its designated rulers  are ruling, opposition to them is opposition to rightness. The problem  then becomes how to thwart anyone who is working against the rulers  or their policies. By the same logic, everyone who thinks that existing  rulers or policies are bad must infer that the ‘who should rule?’ question  has been answered wrongly, and therefore that the power of the rulers  is not legitimate, and that opposing it is legitimate, by force if necessary.  Thus the very question ‘Who should rule?’ begs for violent, authoritarian  answers, and has often received them. It leads those in power into  tyranny, and to the entrenchment of bad rulers and bad policies; it  leads their opponents to violent destructiveness and revolution. Advocates of violence usually have in mind that none of those  things need happen if only everyone agreed on who should rule. But  that means agreeing about what is right, and, given agreement on  that, rulers would then have nothing to do. And, in any case, such  agreement is neither possible nor desirable: people are different, and  have unique ideas; problems are inevitable, and progress consists of  solving them. Popper therefore applies his basic ‘how can we detect and eliminate  errors?’ to political philosophy in the form  how can we rid ourselves  of bad governments without violence?  Just as science seeks explanations  that are experimentally testable, so a rational political system makes  it as easy as possible to detect, and persuade others, that a leader or======================================================== other particles) are ‘particles and waves at the same  time’. There is a field (or ‘waves’) in the multiverse for every individual  particle that we observe in a particular universe. 292 the beginning of infinity Although quantum theory is expressed in mathematical language, I  have now given an account in English of the main features of the reality  that it describes. So at this point the fictional multiverse that I have  been describing is more or less the real one. But there is one thing left  to tidy up. My ‘succession of speculations’ was based on universes, and  on instances of objects, and then on corrections to those ideas in order  to describe the multiverse. But the real multiverse is not ‘based on’  anything, nor is it a correction to anything. Universes, histories, particles  and their instances are not referred to by quantum theory at all – any  more than are planets, and human beings and their lives and loves.  Those are all approximate, emergent phenomena in the multiverse.  A history is part of the multiverse in the same sense that a geological  stratum is part of the Earth’s crust. One history is distinguished from  the others by the values of physical variables, just as a stratum is  distinguished from others by its chemical composition and by the types  of fossils found in it and so on. A stratum and a history are both  channels of information flow. They preserve information because,  although their contents change over time, they are approximately  autonomous  – that is to say, the changes in a particular stratum or  history depend almost entirely on conditions inside it and not else- where. It is because of that autonomy that a fossil found today can be  used as evidence of what was present when that stratum was formed.  Similarly, it is why, within a history, using classical physics, one can  successfully predict some aspects of the future of that history from    its past.  A stratum, like a history, has no separate existence over and above  the objects in it: it  consists  of them. Nor does a stratum have well- defined edges. Also, there are regions of the Earth – for instance, near  volcanoes – where strata have merged (though I think there are no  geological processes that split and remerge strata in the way that  histories split and remerge). There are regions of the Earth – such as  the core – where there have never been strata. And there are regions  – such as the atmosphere – where strata do form but their contents  interact and mix on much shorter timescales than in the crust. Similarly,  there are regions of the multiverse that contain short-lived histories,  and others that do not even approximately contain histories. However, there is one big difference between the ways in which  293 The Multiverse strata and histories emerge from their respective underlying phenomena.  Although not every atom in the Earth’s crust can be unambiguously  assigned to a particular stratum, most of the atoms that form a stratum  can. In contrast, every atom in an everyday object is a multiversal  object, not partitioned into nearly autonomous instances and nearly  autonomous histories, yet everyday objects such as starships and  betrothed couples, which are made of such particles, are partitioned  very accurately into nearly autonomous histories with exactly one  instance, one position, one speed of each object in each history.  That is because of the suppression of interference by entanglement.  As I explained, interference almost always happens either very soon  after splitting or not at all. That is why the larger and more complex  an object or process is, the less its gross behaviour is affected by  interference. At that ‘coarse-grained’ level of emergence, events in the  multiverse consist of autonomous histories, with each coarse-grained  history consisting of a swathe of many histories differing only in  microscopic details but affecting each other through interference.  Spheres of differentiation tend to grow at nearly the speed of light, so,  on the scale of everyday life and above, those coarse-grained histories  can justly be called ‘universes’ in the ordinary sense of the word. Each  of them somewhat resembles the universe of classical physics. And they  can usefully be called ‘parallel’ because they are nearly autonomous.  To the inhabitants, each looks very like a single-universe world. Microscopic events which are accidentally amplified to that coarse- grained level (like the voltage surge in our story) are rare in any one  coarse-grained history, but common in the multiverse as a whole. For  example, consider a single cosmic-ray particle travelling in the direction  of Earth from deep space. That particle must be travelling in a range  of slightly different directions, because the uncertainty principle implies  that in the multiverse it must spread sideways like an ink blot as it  travels. By the time it arrives, this ink blot may well be wider than the  whole Earth – so most of======================================================== different histories: in one, comprising  half  the original  set of universes, the couple in question are still single; in the second,  comprising a  quarter  of the original set, they are married; and in the  third, comprising the remaining quarter, they are divorced.  Thus the three histories do not occupy equal proportions of the  multiverse. There are twice as many universes in which the couple never  married as there are universes in which they divorced.  Now suppose that scientists on the starship know about the multi- verse and understand the physics of the transporter. (Though note that  we have not yet given them a way of discovering those things.) Then  they know that, when they run the transporter, an infinite number of  fungible instances of themselves, all sharing the same history, are doing  so at the same time. They know that a voltage surge will occur in half  the universes in that history, which means that it will split into two  histories of equal measure. Hence they know that, if they use a voltmeter  capable of detecting the surge, half of the instances of themselves are  going to find that it has recorded one, and the other half are not. But  they also know that it is meaningless to ask (not merely impossible to  know)  which  event they will experience. Consequently they can make  two closely related predictions. One is that, despite the perfect deter- minism of everything that is happening,  nothing  can reliably predict  for them whether the voltmeter will detect a surge.  The other prediction is simply that the voltmeter will record a surge  with probability one-half. Thus the outcomes of such experiments are  subjectively random  (from the perspective of any observer) even though  278 the beginning of infinity everything that is happening is completely determined objectively. This  is also the origin of quantum-mechanical randomness and probability  in real physics: it is due to the measure that the theory provides for  the multiverse, which is in turn due to what kinds of physical processes  the theory allows and forbids. Notice that when a random outcome (in this sense) is about to  happen, it is a situation of diversity within fungibility: the diversity is  in the variable ‘what outcome they are  going  to see’. The logic of the  situation is the same as in cases like that of the bank account I discussed  above, except that this time the fungible entities are people. They are  fungible, yet half of them are going to see the surge and the other half  not. In practice they could test this prediction by doing the experiment  many times. Every formula purporting to predict the sequence of  outcomes will eventually fail: that tests the unpredictability. And in  the overwhelming majority of universes (and histories) the surge will  happen approximately half the time: that tests the predicted value of  the probability. Only a tiny proportion of the instances of the observers  will see anything different.  Our story continues. In one of the histories, the newspapers on the  astronauts’ home planets report the engagement. They fill many  column-inches with reports about the accident that brought the  astronauts together and so on. In the other history, where there is no  astronaut-engagement news, one newspaper fills the same space on the  page with a short story. It happens to be about a romance on a starship.  Some of the sentences in that story are identical to sentences in the  news items in the other history. The same words, printed in the same  column in the same newspaper, are fungible between the two histories;  but they are fiction in one history and fact in the other. So here the  fact/fiction attribute has diversity within fungibility. The number of distinct histories will now increase rapidly. Whenever  the transporter is used, it takes only microseconds for the sphere of  differentiation to engulf the whole starship, so, if it is typically used  ten times per day, the number of distinct histories inside the whole  starship will double about ten times a day. Within a month there will  be more distinct histories than there are atoms in our visible universe.  Most of them will be extremely similar to many others, because in only  279 The Multiverse a small proportion will the precise timing and magnitude of the voltage  surge be just right to precipitate a noticeable,  Sliding Doors -type  change. Nevertheless, the number of histories continues to increase  exponentially, and soon there are so many variations on events that  several significant changes have been caused  somewhere  in the multi- versal diversity of the starship. So the total number of such histories  increases exponentially too, even though they continue to constitute  only a small proportion of all histories that are present. Soon after that, in an even smaller but still exponentially grow-  ing number of histories, uncanny chains of ‘accidents’ and ‘unlikely  coincidences’ will have come to dominate events. I======================================================== saying this,  plato  gestures to his own  slave ,   who, well  trained, tosses him a wax-covered writing tablet from a stack that  he is carrying . plato  catches it in one hand and pulls out a stylus .] socrates: At  one stage, Hermes made me aware of the fundamental  distinction between the Athenian approach to life and the Spartan.  It is that – plato : Wait! Let’s all guess! This sounds fascinating.      I’ll start – because this is basically what my poem was about. Well,  the Spartan half of the riddle is easy: Sparta glories in  war . And she  values all the associated virtues such as courage, endurance and so on. [ The other  companions  of Socrates murmur their assent .] We, on the other hand – well, we value  everything , don’t we! Every- thing good, that is. companion no. 1:  Everything good? That seems a bit circular, Plato,  unless you’re going to define ‘good’ in some way that’s independent  of ‘what we Athenians value’. I think I can put it more elegantly:  fighting , versus  having something to fight for . companion no. 2:  Nice. But that’s basically ‘War versus Philosophy’,  isn’t it? plato : [ taking mock offence ] And  poetry . companion no. 3:  Could it be that Athens, whose patron deity is  female, represents the creative spirit in the world, while Sparta  favours Ares, the god of bloodlust and slaughter, whom Athena  defeated and humbled –  plato : No, no, they’re actually not that keen on Ares. They prefer  Artemis. And, strangely enough, they also revere Athena. Did you  know that? chaerephon:  Speaking as an Athenian who is older than all of you  and who has seen plenty of war, may I just say that it seems to me  that Athens, despite all its glorious martial achievements, would be  just as happy to lead a quiet life and be friends with all the Greeks,  and not least with the Spartans. But unfortunately the Spartans like  nothing better than to annoy us whenever they possibly can. Though  247 A Dream of Socrates I must admit that in that respect they are not especially worse than  anyone else. Including our allies! socrates:  Those are very interesting conjectures, all of which I think  do capture aspects of the differences between the cities. And yet I  suspect – and I may of course be mistaken – plato : A Spartan Socrates wouldn’t be  modest . Is that the difference? socrates: No.  (By the way, I think that if anything, he  would  be.)      I suspect that we have all been labouring under a misconception  about Sparta. Could it be that the Spartans do not seek war, as  such, at all? At least, not since they conquered their neighbours,  centuries ago, and made them helots. Perhaps, since then, they have  acquired an entirely different concern that is of overriding  importance to them; and perhaps they fight  only  when that concern  is under threat.  companion no. 2:  What is it? Keeping the helots down? socrates: No,  that would be only a means, not the end in itself. I  think that the god told me what their overarching concern is. And  he also told me what ours is – though alas  we  also fight for all sorts  of other reasons, of which we often repent.     Those two overarching concerns are these: we Athenians are con  - cerned above all with  improvement ; the Spartans seek only –  stasis .  Two opposite objectives. If you think about it, I believe you’ll soon  agree that  this  is the single source of all the myriad differences  between the two cities. plato : I never thought of it that way before, but I think I do agree.  Let me try out the theory. Here’s one difference between the cities:  Sparta has no philosophers. That’s because the job of a philosopher  is to understand things better, which is a form of change, so they  don’t want it. Another difference: they don’t honour living poets,  only dead ones. Why? Because dead poets don’t write anything new,  but live ones do. A third difference: their education system is insanely  harsh; ours is famously lax. Why? Because they don’t want their kids  to dare to question anything, so that they won’t ever think of  changing anything. How am I doing? socrates: You  are quick on the uptake as usual, Aristocles. How- ever – chaerephon:  Socrates, I think I know plenty of Athenians who do  248 the beginning of infinity not seek improvement! We have many politicians who think they’re  perfect. And many sophists who think they know everything. socrates:  But what, specifically, do those politicians believe to be  perfect? Their own grandiose plans for how to  improve  the city .  Similarly, each sophist believes that everyone should adopt his ideas,  which he sees as an  improvement  over everything that has been  believed before .  The laws and customs of Athens are set up to  accommodate all these many rival ideas of perfection (as well as more  modest proposals for improvement), to subject them to criticism, to  winnow out from them what may be the few tiny seeds of truth, and  to test out those that seem the most promising. Thus those======================================================== know doesn’t count as a ‘revelation’.  hermes:  Most Athenians would indeed call those virtues. But how  many really believe it? How many are willing to criticize a  god  by  the standards of reason and justice?  socrates: [ Ponders. ] All who are just, I suppose. For how can anyone  be just if he follows a god of whose moral rightness he is not  persuaded? And how is it possible to be persuaded of someone’s  moral rightness without first forming a view about which qualities  are  morally right? hermes: Y our associates out there on the lawn – are they unjust? socrates: No. hermes:  And are they aware of the connections you have just  described between reason, morality and the reluctance to defer to  gods? socrates:  Perhaps not  sufficiently  aware – yet. hermes: So it is  not true that every just person knows these things. socrates:  Agreed. Perhaps it is only every  wise  person. hermes:  Everyone who is at least as wise as you, then. Who else is in  that exalted category? socrates: Is  there some high purpose in your continuing to mock  me, wise Apollo, by asking me the same question that we asked you  today? It seems to me that your joke is wearing thin. hermes:  Have you, Socrates, never mocked anyone?  socrates: [ with dignity ] If, on occasion, I make fun of someone, it  is because I hope he will help me to seek a truth that neither he nor  I yet knows. I do not mock from on high, as you do. I want only to  goad my fellow mortal into helping me look beyond that which is  easy to see.  hermes:  But what in the world  is  easy to see? What things are the  easiest  to see, Socrates? 226 the beginning of infinity socrates: [ Shrugs. ] Those that are before our eyes. hermes:  And what is before your eyes at this moment? socrates: You  are. hermes:  Are you sure? socrates:  Are you going to start asking me  how I can be sure  of  whatever I say? And then, whatever reason I give, are you going to  ask how I can be sure of  that ?  hermes: No. Do  you think I have come here to play hackneyed  debating tricks? socrates: V ery well: obviously I can’t be  sure  of anything. But I don’t  want to be. I can think of nothing more boring – no offence meant,  wise Apollo – than to attain the state of being perfectly secure in  one’s beliefs, which some people seem to yearn for. I see no use for  it – other than to provide a semblance of an argument when one  doesn’t have a real one. Fortunately that mental state has nothing  to do with what I do yearn for, which is to discover the truth of how  the world is, and why – and, even more, of how it should be. hermes:  Congratulations, Socrates, on your epistemological wisdom.  The knowledge that you seek –  objective knowledge  – is hard to  come by, but attainable. That mental state that you do not seek –  justified belief  – is sought by many people, especially priests and  philosophers. But, in truth, beliefs cannot be justified, except in  relation to other beliefs, and even then only fallibly. So the quest for  their justification can lead only to an infinite regress – each step of  which would itself be subject to error. socrates:  Again, I know this. hermes:  Indeed. And, as you have rightly remarked, it doesn’t count  as a ‘revelation’ if I tell you what you already know. Yet – notice  that that remark is precisely what people who seek justified belief  do not agree with.  socrates:  What?  I’m sorry, but that was too convoluted a comment  for my allegedly wise mind to comprehend. Please explain what I  am to notice about those people who seek ‘justified belief’. hermes:  Merely this. Suppose they just happen to be aware of the  explanation of something. You and I would say that they  know  it.  But to them, no matter how good an explanation it is, and no matter  how true and important and useful it may be, they still do not  227 A Dream of Socrates consider it to be knowledge .  It is only if a god then comes along and  reassures them that it is true (or if they imagine such a god or other  authority) that they count it as knowledge. So, to them it  does  count  as a revelation if the authority tells them what they are already fully  aware of. socrates: I  see that. And I see that they are foolish, because, for all  they know, the ‘authority’ [ gestures at  hermes]  may be toying with  them. Or trying to teach them some important lesson. Or they may  be misunderstanding the authority. Or they may be mistaken in their  belief that it is an authority – hermes: Yes. So  the thing  they  call ‘knowledge’, namely justified belief,  is a chimera. It is  unattainable  to humans except in the form of self- deception; it is  unnecessary  for any good purpose; and it is  undesired   by the wisest among mortals.  socrates: I  know. hermes:  Xenophanes knew it too; but he is no longer among the  mortals – socrates: Is  that what you meant when you told the Oracle that no  one is wiser than I? hermes: [ Ignores the question. ] Hence, also, I wasn’t referring to  justified======================================================== understand why it is perhaps not quite  311 A Physicist’s History of Bad Philosophy as bizarre and isolated an event as it may appear, one has to consider  the broader context of bad philosophy. Error is the normal state of our knowledge, and is no disgrace. There  is nothing bad about  false  philosophy. Problems are inevitable, but  they can be solved by imaginative, critical thought that seeks good  explanations. That is good philosophy, and good science, both of which  have always existed in some measure. For instance, children have  always learned language by making, criticizing and testing conjectures  about the connection between words and reality. They could not  possibly learn it in any other way, as I shall explain in Chapter 16.  Bad philosophy has always existed too. For instance, children have  always been told, ‘Because I say so.’ Although that is not always  intended as a philosophical position, it is worth analysing it as one,  for in four simple words it contains remarkably many themes of false  and  bad philosophy. First, it is a perfect example of bad explanation:  it could be used to ‘explain’ anything .  Second, one way it achieves that  status is by addressing only the form of the question and not the  substance: it is about who said something, not what they said. That is  the opposite of truth-seeking. Third, it reinterprets a request for  true  explanation  (why should something-or-other be as it is?) as a request  for  justification  (what entitles you to assert that it is so?), which is  the justified-true-belief chimera. Fourth, it confuses the nonexistent  authority for ideas  with  human  authority (power) – a much-travelled  path in bad political philosophy. And, fifth, it claims by this means to  stand outside the jurisdiction of normal criticism.  Bad philosophy before the Enlightenment was typically of the  because-I-say-so variety. When the Enlightenment liberated philosophy  and science, they both began to make progress, and increasingly there  was good philosophy. But, paradoxically,  bad  philosophy became  worse . I have said that empiricism initially played a positive role in the  history of ideas by providing a defence against traditional authorities  and dogma, and by attributing a central role – albeit the wrong one  – to experiment in science. At first, the fact that empiricism is an  impossible account of how science works did almost no harm, because  no one took it literally. Whatever scientists may have  said  about  where their discoveries came from, they eagerly addressed interesting  312 the beginning of infinity problems, conjectured good explanations, tested them, and only lastly  claimed to have induced the explanations from experiment. The bottom  line was that they succeeded: they made progress. Nothing prevented  that harmless (self-)deception, and nothing was inferred from it. Gradually, though, empiricism did begin to be taken literally, and so  began to have increasingly harmful effects. For instance, the doctrine  of  positivism , developed during the nineteenth century, tried to eliminate  from scientific theories everything that had not been ‘derived from  observation’. Now, since nothing is ever derived from obser  vation, what  the positivists tried to eliminate depended entirely on their own whims  and intuitions. Occasionally these were even good. For instance, the  physicist Ernst Mach (father of Ludwig Mach of the Mach–Zehnder  interferometer), who was also a positivist philosopher, influenced  Einstein, spurring him to eliminate untested assumptions from physics  – including Newton’s assumption that time flows at the same rate for  all observers. That happened to be an excellent idea. But Mach’s  positivism also caused him to oppose the resulting theory of relativity,  essentially because it claimed that spacetime really exists even though  it cannot be ‘directly’ observed. Mach also resolutely denied the existence  of atoms, because they were too small to observe. We laugh at this  silliness now – when we have microscopes that can see atoms – but the  role of philosophy should have been to laugh at it  then . Instead, when the physicist Ludwig Boltzmann used atomic theory to  unify thermodynamics and mechanics, he was so vilified by Mach and  other positivists that he was driven to despair, which may have contributed  to his suicide just before the tide turned and most branches of physics  shook off Mach’s influence. From then on there was nothing to dis  - courage atomic physics from thriving. Fortunately also, Einstein soon  rejected positivism and became a forthright defender of realism. That  was why he never accepted the Copenhagen interpretation. I wonder:  if Einstein had continued to take positivism seriously, could he ever have  thought of the general theory of relativity, in which spacetime not only  exists but is a dynamic, unseen entity bucking and twisting under the  influence of massive objects? Or would spacetime theory have======================================================== (like a projectile that has exceeded  escape velocity) or whether it would eventually recollapse in a ‘Big  Crunch’. Those were believed to be the only two possibilities. I discus- sed them in  The Fabric of Reality  because they were relevant to the  question: is there a bound on the number of computational steps that  a computer can execute during the lifetime of the universe? If there is,  then physics will also impose a bound on the amount of knowledge  that can be created – knowledge-creation being a form of computation. Everyone’s first thought was that unbounded knowledge-creation is  possible only in a universe that does not recollapse. However, on  analysis it turned out that the reverse is true: in universes that expand  for ever, the inhabitants would run out of energy. But the cosmologist  Frank Tipler discovered that in certain types of recollapsing universes  the Big Crunch singularity is suitable for performing the faster-and- faster trick that we used in Infinity Hotel: an infinite sequence of  computational steps could be executed in a finite time before the  singularity, powered by the ever-increasing tidal effects of the gravi- tational collapse itself. To the inhabitants – who would eventually have  to upload their personalities into computers made of something like  pure tides – the universe would last for ever because they would be  thinking faster and faster, without limit, as it collapsed, and storing  their memories in ever smaller volumes so that access times could also  451 The Beginning be reduced without limit. Tipler called such universes ‘omega-point  universes’. At the time, the observational evidence was consistent with  the real universe being of that type. A small part of the revolution that is currently overtaking cosmology  is that the omega-point models have been ruled out by observation.  Evidence – including a remarkable series of studies of supernovae in  distant galaxies – has forced cosmologists to the unexpected conclusion  that the universe not only will expand for ever but has been expanding  at an accelerating rate.  Something has been counteracting its gravity.  We do not know what. Pending the discovery of a good explanation,  the unknown cause has been named ‘dark energy’. There are several  proposals for what it might be, including effects that merely give the  appearance of acceleration. But the best working hypothesis at present  is that in the equations for gravity there is an additional term, of a  form first mooted by Einstein in 1915 and then dropped because he  realized that his explanation for it was bad. It was proposed again in  the 1980s as a possible effect of quantum field theory, but again there  is no theory of the physical meaning of such a term that is good enough  to predict, for instance, its magnitude. The problem of the nature and  effects of dark energy is no minor detail, nor does anything about it  suggest a perpetually unfathomable mystery. So much for cosmology  being a fundamentally completed science. Depending on what dark energy turns out to be, it may well be  possible to harness it in the distant future, to provide energy for  knowledge-creation to continue for ever. Because this energy would  have to be collected over ever greater distances, the computation would  have to become ever slower. In a mirror image of what would happen  in omega-point cosmologies, the inhabitants of the universe would  notice no slowdown, because, again, they would be instantiated as  computer programs whose total number of steps would be unbounded.  Thus dark energy, which has ruled out one scenario for the unlimited  growth of knowledge, would provide the literal driving force of another. The new cosmological models describe universes that are infinite in  their spatial dimensions. Because the Big Bang happened a finite time  ago, and because of the finiteness of the speed of light, we shall only  ever see a finite portion of infinite space – but that portion will continue  to grow for ever. Thus, eventually, ever more unlikely phenomena will  452 the beginning of infinity come into view. When the total volume that we can see is a million  times larger than it is now, we shall see things that have a probability  of one in a million of existing in space as we see it today. Everything  physically possible will eventually be revealed: watches that came into  existence spontaneously; asteroids that happen to be good likenesses  of William Paley; everything. According to the prevailing theory, all  those things  exist today , but many times too far away for light to have  reached us from them – yet. Light becomes fainter as it spreads out: there are fewer photons per  unit area. That means that ever larger telescopes are needed to detect  a given object at ever larger distances. So there may be a limit to how  distant – and therefore how unlikely – a phenomenon we shall ever be  able to see. Except, that is, for one type of phenomenon: a beginning  of======================================================== the attack on the United States on 11 September 2001, millions of people  worldwide have believed it was carried out by the US government, or  the Israeli secret service. Those are purely factual misconceptions,    yet they bear the imprint of moral wrongness just as clearly as a fossil  – made of purely inorganic material – bears the imprint of ancient    life. And the link, in both cases, is explanation. To concoct a  moral   explanation for why Westerners deserve to be killed indiscriminately,  one needs to explain  factually  that the West is not what it pretends to  be – and that requires uncritical acceptance of conspiracy theories,  denials of history, and so on. Quite generally, in order to understand the moral landscape in terms  of a given set of values, one needs to understand some facts as being  a certain way too. And the converse is also true: for example, as the  philosopher Jacob Bronowski pointed out, success at making factual,  scientific discoveries entails a commitment to all sorts of values that  are necessary for making progress. The individual scientist has to value  truth, and good explanations, and be open to ideas and to change. The  scientific community, and to some extent the civilization as a whole,  has to value tolerance, integrity and openness of debate.  We should not be surprised at these connections. The truth has  structural unity as well as logical consistency, and I guess that no true  explanation is entirely disconnected from any other. Since the universe  is explicable, it must be that morally right values are connected in    this way with true factual theories, and morally wrong values with  false theories. Moral philosophy is basically about the problem of what to do next  122 the beginning of infinity – and, more generally, what sort of life to lead, and what sort of world  to want. Some philosophers confine the term ‘moral’ to problems  about how one should treat other people. But such problems are  continuous with problems of individuals choosing what sort of life  to lead, which is why I adopt the more inclusive definition. Terminology  aside, if you were suddenly the last human on Earth, you would be  wondering what sort of life to want. Deciding ‘I should do whatever  pleases me most’ would give you very little clue, because what pleases  you depends on your moral judgement of what constitutes a good  life, not vice versa. This also illustrates the emptiness of reductionism in philosophy. For  if I ask you for advice about what objectives to pursue in life, it is no  good telling me to do what the laws of physics mandate. I shall do that  in any case. Nor is it any good telling me to do what I prefer, because  I don’t know what I prefer to do until I have decided what sort of life  I want to lead or how I should want the world to be. Since our preferences  are shaped in this way, at least in part, by our moral explanations, it  does not make sense to define right and wrong entirely in terms of their  utility in meeting people’s preferences. Trying to do so is the project of  the influential moral philosophy known as  utili  tarianism , which played  much the same role as empiricism did in the philosophy of science: it  acted as a liberating focus for the rebellion against traditional dogmas,  while its own positive content contained little truth.  So there is no avoiding what-to-do-next problems, and, since the  distinction between right and wrong appears in our best explanations  that address such problems, we must regard that distinction as real. In  other words, there is an objective difference between right and wrong:  those are real attributes of objectives and behaviours. In Chapter 14    I shall argue that the same is true in the field of aesthetics: there is such  a thing as objective beauty. Beauty, right and wrong, primality, infinite sets – they all exist  objectively. But not physically. What does that mean? Certainly they  can affect you – as examples like Hofstadter’s show – but apparently  not in the same sense that physical objects do. You cannot trip over  one of them in the street. However, there is less to that distinction than  our empiricism-biased common sense assumes. First of all, being  affected  by a physical object means that something about the physical  123 The Reality of Abstractions object has caused a change, via the laws of physics (or, equivalently,  that the laws of physics have caused a change via that object). But  causation and the laws of physics are not themselves physical objects.  They are abstractions, and our knowledge of them comes – just as for  all other abstractions – from the fact that our best explanations invoke  them. Progress depends on explanation, and therefore trying to conceive  of the world as merely a sequence of events with unexplained regularities  would entail giving up on progress. This argument that abstractions really exist does not tell us what  they exist  as  – for instance, which of them are======================================================== it misses and the rest strikes everywhere on  the exposed surface. Remember, this is just a single particle, which may  consist of fungible instances. The next thing that happens is that they  cease to be fungible, splitting through their interaction with atoms at  their points of arrival into a finite but huge number of instances, each  of which is the origin of a separate history. 294 the beginning of infinity In each such history, there is an autonomous instance of the cosmic- ray particle, which will dissipate its energy in creating a ‘cosmic-ray  shower’ of electrically charged particles. Thus, in different histories,  such a shower will occur at different locations. In some, that shower  will provide a conducting path down which a lightning bolt will travel.  Every atom on the surface of the Earth will be struck by such lightning  in  some  history. In other histories, one of those cosmic-ray particles  will strike a human cell, damaging some already damaged DNA in  such a way as to make the cell cancerous. Some non-negligible pro  - portion of all cancers are caused in this way. As a result, there exist  histories in which any given person, alive in our history at any time,  is killed soon afterwards by cancer. There exist other histories in which  the course of a battle, or a war, is changed by such an event, or by a  lightning bolt at exactly the right place and time, or by any of countless  other unlikely, ‘random’ events. This makes it highly plausible that  there exist histories in which events have played out more or less as  in alternative-history stories such as  Fatherland  and  Roma Eterna  – or  in which events in your own life played out very differently, for better  or worse. A great deal of fiction is therefore close to a fact somewhere in the  multiverse. But not all fiction. For instance, there are no histories in  which my stories of the transporter malfunction are true, because they  require different laws of physics. Nor are there histories in which the  fundamental constants of nature such as the speed of light or the charge  on an electron are different. There is, however, a sense in which different  laws of physics  appear  to be true for a period in some histories, because  of a sequence of ‘unlikely accidents’. (There may also be universes in  which there are different laws of physics, as required in anthropic  explanations of fine-tuning. But as yet there is no viable theory of such  a multiverse.) Imagine a single photon from a starship’s communication laser,  heading towards Earth. Like the cosmic ray, it arrives all over the  surface, in different histories. In each history, only one atom will absorb  the photon and the rest will initially be completely unaffected. A receiver  for such communications would then detect the relatively large, discrete  change undergone by such an atom. An important consequence for the  construction of measuring devices (including eyes) is that no matter  295 The Multiverse how far away the source is, the kick given to an atom by an arriving  photon is always the same: it is just that the weaker the signal is, the  fewer kicks there are. If this were not so – for instance, if classical physics  were true – weak signals would be much more easily swamped by  random local noise. This is the same as the advantage of digital over  analogue information processing that I discussed in Chapter 6. Some of my own research in physics has been concerned with the  theory of  quantum computers . These are computers in which the  information-carrying variables have been protected by a variety of  means from becoming entangled with their surroundings. This allows  a new mode of computation in which the flow of information is not  confined to a single history. In one type of quantum computation,  enormous numbers of different computations, taking place simul- taneously, can affect each other and hence contribute to the output of  a computation. This is known as  quantum parallelism . In a typical quantum computation, individual bits of information are  represented in physical objects known as ‘qubits’ – quantum bits – of  which there is a large variety of physical implementations but always  with two essential features. First, each qubit has a variable that can take  one of two discrete values, and, second, special measures are taken to  protect the qubits from entanglement – such as cooling them to  temperatures close to absolute zero. A typical algorithm using quantum  parallelism begins by causing the information-carrying variables in some  of the qubits to acquire both their values simultaneously. Con    sequently,  regarding those qubits as a register representing (say) a number, the  number of separate instances of the register as a whole is exponentially  large: two to the power of the number of qubits. Then, for a period,  classical computations are performed, during which waves of  differentiation spread to some of the other qubits – but no further,======================================================== without quotation marks around the technical terms.  So will subsequent bad philosophy. For, suppose that someone now  does dare to seek explanatory theories about the cause of human  happiness. Happiness is a state of continually solving one’s problems,  they conjecture. Unhappiness is caused by being chronically baulked  in one’s attempts to do that. And solving problems itself depends on  319 A Physicist’s History of Bad Philosophy knowing how; so, external factors aside, unhappiness is caused by not  knowing how. (Readers may recognize this as a special case of the  principle of optimism.) Interpreters of the study say that it has refuted that theory of happi- ness.  At most 50 per cent  of unhappiness can be caused by not knowing  how, they say. The other 50 per cent is beyond our control: genetically  determined, and hence independent of what we know or believe,  pending the relevant genetic engineering. (Using the same logic on the  slavery example, one could have concluded in 1860 that, say, 95 per  cent of slavery is genetically determined and therefore beyond the  power of political action to remedy.) At this point – taking the step from ‘heritable’ to ‘genetically deter- mined’ – the explanationless psychological study has transformed its  correct but uninteresting result into something very exciting. For it has  weighed in on a substantive philosophical issue (optimism)  and  a  scientific issue about how the brain gives rise to mental states such as  qualia. But it has done so without knowing anything about them.  But wait, say the interpreters. Admittedly we can’t tell whether any  genes  code  for happiness (or part of it) .  But who cares how the genes  cause the effect – whether by conferring good looks or otherwise? The  effect itself is real.  The effect is real, but the experiment cannot detect how much of it  one can alter without genetic engineering, just by knowing how. That  is because the way in which those genes affect happiness may itself  depend on knowledge. For instance, a cultural change may affect what  people deem to be ‘good looks’, and that would then change whether  people tend to be made happier by virtue of having particular genes.  Nothing in the study can detect whether such a change is about to  happen. Similarly, it cannot detect whether a book will be written one  day which will persuade some proportion of the population that all  evils are due to lack of knowledge, and that knowledge is created by  seeking good explanations. If some of those people consequently create  more knowledge than they otherwise would have, and become happier  than they otherwise would have been, then part of the 50 per cent of  happiness that was ‘genetically determined’ in all previous studies will  no longer be so. The interpreters of the study may respond that it has proved that  320 the beginning of infinity there can be no such book! Certainly none of them will  write  such a  book, or arrive at such a thesis. And so the bad philosophy will have  caused bad science, which will have stifled the growth of knowledge.  Notice that this is a form of bad science that may well have conformed  to all the best practices of scientific method – proper randomizing,  proper controls, proper statistical analysis. All the  formal  rules of ‘how  to keep from fooling ourselves’ may have been followed. And yet no  progress could possibly be made, because  it was not being sought :  explanationless theories can do no more than entrench existing, bad  explanations. It is no accident that, in the imaginary study I have described, the  outcome appeared to support a pessimistic theory. A theory that pre  - dicts how happy people will (probably) be cannot possibly take account  of the effects of knowledge-creation. So, to whatever extent knowledge- creation is involved, the theory is prophecy, and will therefore be biased  towards pessimism.  Behaviouristic studies of human psychology must, by their nature,  lead to dehumanizing theories of the human condition. For refusing  to theorize about the mind as a causative agent is the equivalent of  regarding it as a non-creative automaton. The behaviourist approach is equally futile when applied to the issue  of  whether  an entity has a mind. I have already criticized it in Chapter  7, in regard to the Turing test. The same holds in regard to the con  - troversy about animal minds – such as whether the hunting or farming  of animals should be legal – which stems from philosophical disputes  about whether animals experience qualia analogous to those of humans  when in fear and pain, and, if so, which animals do. Now, science    has little to say on this matter at present, because there is as yet no  explanatory theory of qualia, and hence no way of detecting them  experimentally. But this does not stop governments from trying to pass  the political hot potato to the supposedly objective jurisdiction of  experimental science. So, for instance, in 1997 the======================================================== and  for generations, for their suffering to be relieved, not only fail to make  progress in realizing any such hope: they largely fail even to try to  make any, or even to think about trying. If they do see an opportunity,  they reject it. The spirit of creativity with which we are all born    is systematically extinguished in them before it can ever create anything  new. A static society involves – in a sense  consists  of – a relentless struggle  to prevent knowledge from growing. But there is more to it than that.  For there is no reason to expect that a rapidly spreading idea, if one  did happen to arise in a static society, would be true or useful. That is  another aspect missing from my story of the static society above. I  assumed  that the change would be for the better. It might not have been,  especially as the lack of critical sophistication in a static society would  leave people vulnerable to false and harmful ideas from which their  taboos did not protect them. For instance, when the Black Death plague  destabilized the static societies of Europe in the fourteenth century, the  new ideas for plague-prevention that spread best were extremely bad  ones. Many people decided that this was the end of the world, and that  therefore attempting any further earthly improvements was pointless.  Many went out to kill Jews or ‘witches’. Many crowded together in  churches and monasteries to pray (thus unwittingly facilitating the  spread of the disease, which was carried by fleas). A cult called the  Flagellants arose, whose members devoted their lives to flogging them- selves, and to preaching all the above measures, in order to prove to  God that his children were sorry. All these ideas were functionally  harmful as well as factually false, and were eventually suppressed by  the authorities in their drive to return to stasis. Thus, ironically, there is much truth in the typical static-society fear  that any change is much more likely to do harm than good. A static  society is indeed in constant danger of being harmed or destroyed by  a newly arising dysfunctional meme. However, in the aftermath of the  Black Death a few true and functional ideas did also spread, and may  well have contributed to ending that particular static society in an  unusually good way (with the Renaissance). Static societies survive by effectively eliminating the type of evolution  that is unique to memes, namely creative variation intended to meet  386 the beginning of infinity the holders’ individual preferences. In the absence of that, meme  evolution resembles gene evolution more closely, and some of the grim  conclusions of the naive analogies between them apply after all. Static  societies do tend to settle issues by violence, and they do tend to sacrifice  the welfare of individuals for the ‘good’ of (that is to say, for the  prevention of changes in) society. I mentioned that people who rely on  such analogies end up either advocating a static society or condoning  violence and oppression. We now see that those two responses are  essentially the same: oppression is what it takes to keep a society static;  oppression of a given kind will not last long unless the society is static. Since the sustained, exponential growth of knowledge has unmistak- able effects, we can deduce without historical research that every  society on Earth before the current Western civilization has either been  static or has been destroyed within a few generations. The golden ages  of Athens and Florence are examples of the latter, but there may have  been many others. This directly contradicts the widely held belief that  individuals in primitive societies were happy in a way that has not  been possible since – that they were unconstrained by social conven- tion and other imperatives of civilization, and hence were able to  achieve self-expression and fulfilment of their needs and desires. But  primitive societies (including tribes of hunter-gatherers) must all have  been static societies, because if ever one ceased to be static it would  soon cease to be primitive, or else destroy itself by losing its distinctive  knowledge. In the latter case, the growth of knowledge would still be  inhibited by the raw violence which would immediately replace the  static society’s institutions. For once violence is mediating changes,  they will typically not be for the better. Since static societies cannot  exist without effec  tively extinguishing the growth of knowledge, they  cannot allow their members much opportunity to pursue happiness.  (Ironically, creating knowledge is itself a natural human need and  desire, and static societies, however primitive, ‘unnaturally’ suppress  it.) From the point of view of every individual in such a society, its  creativity-suppressing mechanisms are catastrophically harmful. Every  static society must leave its members chronically baulked in their  attempts to achieve anything positive for themselves as people, or======================================================== had  included important elements of the true explanation: planetary orbits  are indeed determined by laws of nature; those laws are indeed the  same for all planets, including the Earth; they do involve the sun; they  are mathematical and geometrical in character; and so on. With the  hindsight provided by each successive theory, we can see not only where  the previous theory made false predictions, but also that wherever it  made true predictions this was  because  it had expressed some truth  about reality. So its truth lives on in the new theory – as Einstein  remarked, ‘There could be no fairer destiny for any physical theory  than that it should point the way to a more comprehensive theory in  which it lives on as a limiting case.’ As I explained in Chapter 1, regarding the explanatory function of  theories as paramount is not just an idle preference. The predictive  function of science is entirely dependent on it. Also, in order to make  progress in any field, it is the explanations in existing theories, not the  predictions, that have to be creatively varied in order to conjecture the  next theory. Furthermore, the explanations in one field affect our  understanding of other fields. For instance, if someone thinks that a  conjuring trick is due to supernatural abilities of the conjurer, it will  affect how they judge theories in cosmology (such as the origin of the  universe, or the fine-tuning problem) and in psychology (how the  human mind works) and so on. By the way, it is something of a misconception that the predictions  of successive theories of planetary motion  were  all that similar. Newton’s  predictions are indeed excellent in the context of bridge-building, and  only slightly inadequate when running the Global Positioning System,  but they are hopelessly wrong when explaining a pulsar or a quasar  – or the universe as a whole. To get all those right, one needs Einstein’s  radically different explanations. Such large discontinuities in the meanings of successive scientific  114 the beginning of infinity theories have no biological analogue: in an evolving species, the  dominant strain in each generation differs only slightly from that in  the previous generation. Nevertheless, scientific discovery is a gradual  process too; it is just that, in science, all the gradualness, and nearly  all the criticism and rejection of bad explanations, takes place inside  the scientists’ minds. As Popper put it, ‘We can let our theories die in  our place.’ There is another, even more important, advantage in that ability to  criticize theories without staking one’s life on them. In an evolving  species, the adaptations of the organisms in each generation must    have enough functionality to keep the organism alive, and to pass all    the tests that they encounter in propagating themselves to the next  generation. In contrast, the intermediate explanations leading a scientist  from one good explanation to the next need not be viable at all. The  same is true of creative thought in general. This is the fundamental  reason that explanatory ideas are able to escape from parochialism,  while biological evolution, and rules of thumb, cannot. That brings me to the main subject of this chapter: abstractions. In  Chapter 4 I remarked that pieces of knowledge are abstract replicators  that ‘use’ (and hence  affect ) organisms and brains to get themselves  replicated. That is a higher level of explanation than the emergent  levels I have mentioned so far. It is a claim that something abstract –  something non-physical, such as the knowledge in a gene or a theory  – is affecting something physical. Physically, nothing is happening in  such a situation other than that one set of emergent entities – such as  genes, or computers – is affecting others, which is already anathema  to reductionism. But abstractions are essential to a fuller explanation.  You know that if your computer beats you at chess, it is really the  program  that has beaten you, not the silicon atoms or the computer  as such. The abstract program is instantiated physically as a high-level  behaviour of vast numbers of atoms, but the  explanation  of why it has  beaten you cannot be expressed without also referring to the program  in its own right. That program has also been instantiated, unchanged,  in a long chain of different physical substrates, including neurons in  the brains of the programmers and radio waves when you downloaded  the program via wireless networking, and finally as states of long- and  short-term memory banks in your computer. The specifics of that chain  115 The Reality of Abstractions of instantiations may be relevant to explaining how the program  reached you, but it is irrelevant to why it beat you: there, the content  of the knowledge (in it, and in you) is the whole story. That story is an  explanation that refers ineluctably to abstractions; and therefore those  abstractions exist, and really do affect physical objects in======================================================== and Plato increasingly gets the wrong end of the stick. In reality, the  communication of new ideas – even mundane ones like directions –  depends on guesswork on the part of both the recipient and the  communicator, and is inherently fallible. Hence there is no reason to  expect that the young Plato, just because he was intelligent and highly  educated, and by all accounts a near-worshipper of Socrates, made the  fewest mistakes in conveying Socrates’ theories. On the contrary, the  255 A Dream of Socrates default assumption should be that misunderstandings are ubiquitous  and that neither intelligence nor the intention to be accurate is any  guarantee against them. It could easily be that the young Plato mis  - understood everything that Socrates said to him, and that the older  Plato gradually succeeded in understanding it, and is therefore the more  reliable guide. Or it could be that Plato slipped ever further into  misinterpretation, and into positive errors of his own. Evidence, argu- ment and explanation are needed to distinguish between these and  many other possibilities. It is a difficult task for historians. Objective  knowledge, though attainable, is hard to attain. All this holds as much for knowledge written down as for knowledge  spoken in person. So there would still be a ‘Socratic problem’ even if  Socrates had written books. Indeed, there is such a problem in regard  to the prolific Plato, and sometimes even in regard to living philosophers.  What does the philosopher mean by such and such a term or assertion?  What problem is the assertion intended to solve, and how? These are  not themselves philosophical problems. They are problems in the  history of philosophy. Yet nearly all philosophers, especially academic  ones, have devoted a great deal of their attention to them. Courses in  philosophy place great weight on reading original texts, and com  - mentaries on them, in order to understand the theories that were in  the minds of various great philosophers.  This focus on history is odd, and is in marked contrast to all other  academic disciplines (except perhaps history itself). For example, in all  the physics courses that I took at university, both as an undergraduate  and as a graduate student, I cannot recall a single instance where any  original papers or books by the great physicists of old were studied or  were even on the reading list. Only when a course touched upon very  recent discoveries did we ever read the work of their discoverers. So  we learned Einstein’s theory of relativity without ever hearing from  Einstein; we knew Maxwell, Boltzmann, Schrödinger, Heisenberg and  so on only as names. We read their  theories  in textbooks whose authors  were physicists (not historians of physics) who themselves may well  never have read the works of those pioneers. Why? The immediate reason is that the original sources of scientific  theories are almost never good sources. How could they be? All  subsequent expositions are intended to be improvements on them, and  256 the beginning of infinity some succeed, and improvements are cumulative. And there is a deeper  reason. The originators of a fundamental new theory initially share  many of the misconceptions of previous theories. They need to develop  an understanding of how and why those theories are flawed, and how  the new theory explains everything that they explained. But most  people who subsequently learn the new theory have quite different  concerns. Often they just want to take the theory for granted and use  it to make predictions, or to understand some complex phenomenon  in combination with other theories. Or they may want to understand  nuances of it that have nothing to do with why it is superior to the old  theories. Or they may want to improve it. But what they no longer  care about is tracking down and definitively meeting every last objec- tion that would naturally be made by someone thinking in terms of  older, superseded theories. There is rarely any reason for scientists to  address the obsolete problem-situations that motivated the great  scientists of the past.  Historians  of science, in contrast, must do precisely that – and they  encounter much the same difficulties as the historians of philosophy  who address the Socratic problem. Why, then, do scientists not en    - counter these difficulties when learning scientific theories? What is it  that allows such theories to be communicated through chains of  intermediaries with such apparent ease? What has happened to the  ‘difficulty of communication’ that I stressed above?  The first, seemingly paradoxical, half of the answer is that, when  they learn a theory, scientists are not interested in what the theory’s  originator, or anyone else along the chain of communication, believed.  When physicists read a textbook on the theory of relativity, their  immediate objective is to learn the  theory , and not the opinions of  Einstein or of the textbook’s author. If======================================================== it? This can seem plausible only if one  forgets that there can be only one type of person: universal explainers  and constructors. The idea that there could be beings that are to us as  we are to animals is a belief in the supernatural.  Moreover, there is only one way of making progress: conjecture and  criticism. And the only moral values that permit sustained progress are  the objective values that the Enlightenment has begun to discover. No  doubt the extraterrestrials’ morality is different from ours; but that  will not be because it resembles that of the conquistadors. Nor would  we be in serious danger of culture shock from contact with an advanced  civilization: it will know how to educate its own children (or AIs), so  204 the beginning of infinity it will know how to educate us – and, in particular, to teach us how  to use its computers.  A further misconception is Hawking’s analogy between our civil- ization and pre-Enlightenment civilizations: as I shall explain in  Chapter 15, there is a qualitative difference between those two    types of civilization. Culture shock need not be dangerous to a post- Enlightenment one. As we look back on the failed civilizations of the past, we can see  that they were so poor, their technology was so feeble, and their  explanations of the world so fragmentary and full of misconceptions  that their caution about innovation and progress was as perverse as  expecting a blindfold to be useful when navigating dangerous waters.  Pessimists believe that the present state of our own civilization is an  exception to that pattern. But what does the precautionary principle  say about  that  claim? Can we be sure that our present knowledge, too,  is not riddled with dangerous gaps and misconceptions? That our  present wealth is not pathetically inadequate to deal with unforeseen  problems? Since we cannot be sure, would not the precautionary  principle require us to confine ourselves to the policy that would always  have been salutary in the past – namely innovation and, in emergencies,  even blind optimism about the benefits of new knowledge?  Also, in the case of our civilization, the precautionary principle rules  itself out. Since our civilization has not been following it, a transition  to it would entail reining in the rapid technological progress that is  under way. And such a change has never been successful before. So a  blind pessimist would have to oppose it on principle.  This may seem like logic-chopping, but it is not. The reason for these  paradoxes and parallels between blind optimism and blind pessimism  is that those two approaches are very similar at the level of explanation.  Both are prophetic: both purport to know unknowable things about  the future of knowledge. And since at any instant our best knowledge  contains both truth and misconception, prophetic pessimism about any  one aspect of it is always the same as prophetic optimism about another.  For instance, Rees’s worst fears depend on the unprecedentedly rapid  creation of unprecedentedly powerful technology, such as civilization- destroying bio-weapons. If Rees is right that the twenty-first century is uniquely dangerous,  205 Optimism and if civilization nevertheless survives it, it will have had an appallingly  narrow escape.  Our Final Century  mentions only one other example  of a narrow escape, namely the Cold War – so that will make two narrow  escapes in a row. Yet, by that standard, civilization must already have  had a similarly narrow escape during the Second World War. For  instance, Nazi Germany came close to developing nuclear weapons; the  Japanese Empire did successfully weaponize bubonic plague – and had  tested the weapon with devastating effect in China and had plans to  use it against the United States. Many feared that even a conventionally  won victory by the Axis powers could bring down civilization. Churchill  warned of ‘a new dark age, made more sinister and perhaps more  protracted by the lights of perverted science’ – though, as an optimist,  he worked to prevent that. In contrast, the Austrian writer Stefan Zweig  and his wife committed suicide in 1942, in the safety of neutral Brazil,  because they considered civilization to be already doomed.  So that would make it three narrow escapes in a row. But was there  not a still earlier one? In 1798, Malthus had argued, in his influential  essay  On Population , that the nineteenth century would inevitably  see a permanent end to human progress. He had calculated that the  exponentially growing population at the time, which was a consequence  of various technological and economic improvements, was reaching the  limit of the planet’s capacity to produce food. And this was no accidental  misfortune. He believed that he had discovered a law of nature about  population and resources. First, the net increase in population, in each  generation, is proportional to the existing population, so the population  increases======================================================== many facts about  finite things are just as counter-intuitive. What Dawkins calls the  ‘argument from personal incredulity’ is no argument: it represents  nothing but a preference for parochial misconceptions over universal  truths.  In physics, too, infinity has been contemplated since antiquity. Euclid- ean space was infinite; and, in any case, space was usually regarded as  a continuum: even a finite line was composed of infinitely many points.  There were also infinitely many instants between any two times. But  the understanding of continuous quantities was patchy and con  - tradictory until Newton and Leibniz invented calculus, a technique    for analysing continuous change in terms of infinite numbers of  infinitesimal changes.  The ‘beginning of infinity’ – the possibility of the unlimited growth  of knowledge in the future – depends on a number of other infinities.  One of them is the universality in the laws of nature which allows  finite, local symbols to apply to the whole of time and space – and to  all phenomena and all possible phenomena. Another is the existence  of physical objects that are universal explainers – people – which, it  turns out, are necessarily universal constructors as well, and must  contain universal classical computers. Most forms of universality themselves refer to some sort of infinity  – though they can always be interpreted in terms of something    165 A Window on Infinity being  unlimited  rather than actually infinite. This is what opponents  of infinity call a ‘potential infinity’ rather than a ‘realized’ one. For  instance, the beginning of infinity can be described either as a condition  where ‘progress in the future will be  unbounded’  or as the condition  where ‘an  infinite  amount of progress will be made’. But I use those  concepts interchangeably, because in this context there is no substantive  difference between them.  There is a philosophy of mathematics called  finitism , the doctrine  that only finite abstract entities exist. So, for instance, there are infinitely  many natural numbers, but finitists insist that that is just a manner of  speaking. They say that the literal truth is only that there is a finite rule  for generating each natural number (or, more precisely, each numeral)  from the previous one, and nothing literally infinite is involved. But  this doctrine runs into the following problem: is there a largest natural  number or not? If there is, then that contradicts the statement that  there is a rule that defines a larger one. If there is not, then there are  not finitely many natural numbers. Finitists are then obliged to deny  a principle of logic: the ‘law of the excluded middle’, which is that, for  every meaningful proposition, either it or its negation is true. So finitists  say that, although there is no largest number, there is not an infinity  of numbers either.  Finitism is instrumentalism applied to mathematics: it is a principled  rejection of explanation. It attempts to see mathematical entities purely  as procedures that mathematicians follow, rules for making marks on  paper and so on – useful in some situations, but not referring to  anything real other than the finite objects of experience such as two  apples or three oranges. And so finitism is inherently anthropocentric  – which is not surprising, since it regards parochialism as a virtue of a  theory rather than a vice. It also suffers from another fatal flaw that  instrumentalism and empiricism have in regard to science, which is that  it assumes that mathematicians have some  sort of privileged access to  finite  entities which they do not have for infinite ones. But that is not  the case. All observation is theory-laden. All abstract theorizing is  theory-laden too. All access to abstract entities, finite or infinite, is via  theory, just as for physical entities. In other words finitism, like instrumentalism, is nothing but a project  for preventing progress in understanding the entities beyond our direct  166 the beginning of infinity experience. But that means progress generally, for, as I have explained,  there are no entities  within  our ‘direct experience’. The whole of the above discussion assumes the universality of  reason .  The reach of science has inherent limitations; so does mathematics; so  does every branch of philosophy. But if you believe that there are  bounds on the domain in which reason is the proper arbiter of ideas,  then you believe in unreason or the supernatural. Similarly, if you reject  the infinite, you are stuck with the finite, and the finite is parochial. So  there is no way of stopping there. The best explanation of  anything  eventually involves universality, and therefore infinity. The reach of  explanations cannot be limited by fiat.  One expression of this within mathematics is the principle, first made  explicit by the mathematician Georg Cantor in the nineteenth century,  that abstract entities may be defined in any desired======================================================== physics were in fact different from what we  currently think they are, then so might be the set of mathematical truths  that we would then be able to prove, and so might the operations that  would be available to prove them with. The laws of physics as we  know them happen to afford a privileged status to such operations as  not ,  and  and  or , acting on individual bits of information (binary digits,  or logical true/false values). That is why those operations seem natural,  elementary and finite to us – and why bits do. If the laws of physics  were like, say, those of Infinity Hotel, then there would be additional  privileged operations, acting on infinite sets of bits. With some other  laws of physics, the operations  not ,  and  and  or  would be non-computable,  while some of our non-computable functions would seem natural,  elementary and finite. That brings me to another distinction that depends on the laws of  physics:  simple  versus  complex . Brains are physical objects. Thoughts  are computations, of the types permitted under the laws of physics.  Some explanations can be grasped easily and quickly – like ‘If Socrates  was a man and Plato was a man then they were both men.’ This is easy  because it can be stated in a short sentence and relies on the properties  187 A Window on Infinity of an elementary operation (namely  and ). Other explanations are  inherently hard to grasp, because their shortest form is still long    and depends on many such operations. But whether the form of an  ex    planation is long or short, and whether it requires few or many  elementary operations, depends entirely on the laws of physics under  which it is being stated and understood. Quantum  computation, which is currently believed to be the fully  universal form of computation, happens to have exactly the same    set of computable functions as Turing’s classical computation. But  quantum computation drives a coach and horses through the classical  notion of a ‘simple’ or ‘elementary’ operation. It makes some intuitively  very complex things simple. Moreover, the elementary information- storing entity in quantum computation, the ‘qubit’ (quantum bit) is  quite hard to explain in non-quantum terminology. Meanwhile the  bit  is a fairly complicated object from the perspective of quantum  physics. Some people object that quantum computation therefore isn’t ‘real’  computation: it is just physics, just engineering. To them, those logical  possibilities about exotic laws of physics enabling exotic forms of  computation do not address the issue of what a proof ‘really’ is. Their  objection would go something like this: admittedly, under suitable laws  of physics we would be able to compute non-Turing-computable  functions, but that would not be  computation . We would be able to  establish the truth or falsity of Turing-undecidable propositions, but  that ‘establishing’ would not be  proving , because then our knowledge  of whether the proposition was true or false would for ever depend on  our knowledge of what the laws of physics are. If we discovered one  day that the real laws of physics were different, we might have to  change our minds about the proof too, and its conclusion. And so it  would not be a real proof: real proof is independent of physics. Here is that same misconception again (as well as some authority- seeking justificationism). Our  knowledge  of whether a proposition is  true or false  always  depends on knowledge about how physical objects  behave. If we changed our minds about what a computer, or a brain,  has been doing – for instance, if we decided that our own memory  was faulty about which steps we had checked in a proof – then we  would be forced to change our opinion about whether we had proved  188 the beginning of infinity some  thing or not. It would be no different if we changed our minds  about what the laws of physics made the computer do. Whether a mathematical proposition is true or not is indeed inde- pend  ent of physics. But the  proof  of such a proposition is a matter  of physics only. There is no such thing as abstractly proving some-  thing, just as there is no such thing as abstractly knowing something.  Mathematical truth is absolutely necessary and transcendent, but    all knowledge is generated by physical processes, and its scope and  limitations are conditioned by the laws of nature. One can define a  class of abstract entities and call them ‘proofs’ (or computations), just  as one can define abstract entities and call them triangles and have  them obey Euclidean geometry. But you cannot infer anything from  that theory of ‘triangles’ about what angle you will turn through if you  walk around a closed path consisting of three straight lines. Nor can  those ‘proofs’ do the job of verifying mathematical statements. A  mathematical ‘theory of proofs’ has no bearing on which truths can  or cannot be proved in reality, or be known in reality; and similarly a  theory of======================================================== celebrates Persephone’s revenge and the  anniversary of her escape by commanding plants to grow and adorn  the Earth. This myth accounts for the same observations as the original,  and it is testable (and in fact refuted) by the same observations. Yet  what it asserts about reality is markedly different from – in many ways  it is the opposite of – the original myth. Every other detail of the story, apart from its bare prediction that  winter happens once a year, is just as easily variable. So, although the  myth was created to explain the seasons, it is only superficially adapted  to that purpose. When its author was wondering what could possibly  make a goddess do something once a year, he did not shout, ‘Eureka!  It must have been a marriage contract enforced by a magic seed.’ He  made that choice – and all his substantive choices as author – for  cultural and artistic reasons, and not because of the attributes of winter  at all. He may also have been trying to explain aspects of human nature  metaphorically – but here I am concerned with the myth only in its  capacity as an explanation  of seasons , and in that respect even its  21 The Reach of Explanations author could not have denied that the role of all the details could be  played equally well by countless other things. The Persephone and Freyr myths assert radically incompatible things  about what is happening in reality to cause seasons. Yet no one, I guess,  has ever adopted either myth as a result of comparing it on its merits  with the other, because there is no way of distinguishing between them.  If we ignore all the parts of both myths whose role could be easily  replaced, we are left with the same core explanation in both cases:  the  gods did it . Although Freyr is a very different god of spring from  Persephone, and his battles very different events from her conjugal  visits, none of those differing attributes has any function in the myths’  respective accounts of why seasons happen. Hence none of them  provides any reason for choosing one explanation over the other. The reason those myths are so easily variable is that their details are  barely connected to the details of the phenomena. Nothing in the  problem of why winter happens is addressed by postulating specifically  a marriage contract or a magic seed, or the gods Persephone, Hades  and Demeter – or Freyr. Whenever a wide range of variant theories can  account equally well for the phenomenon they are trying to explain,  there is no reason to prefer one of them over the others, so advocating  a particular one in preference to the others is irrational.  That freedom to make drastic changes in those mythical explanations  of seasons is the fundamental flaw in them. It is the reason that myth- making in general is not an effective way to understand the world. And  that is so whether the myths are testable or not, for whenever it is easy  to vary an explanation without changing its predictions, one could just  as easily vary it to make different predictions if they were needed. For  example, if the ancient Greeks  had  discovered that the seasons in the  northern and southern hemispheres are out of phase, they would have  had a choice of countless slight variants of the myth that would be  consistent with that observation. One would be that when Demeter is  sad she banishes warmth  from her vicinity , and it has to go elsewhere  – into the southern hemisphere. Similarly, slight variants of the Perse- phone explanation could account just as well for seasons that were  marked by green rainbows, or seasons that happened once a week, or  sporadically, or not at all. Likewise for the superstitious gambler or  the end-of-the-world prophet: when their theory is refuted by experience,  22 the beginning of infinity they do indeed switch to a new one; but, because their underlying  explanations are bad, they can easily accommodate the new experience  without changing the substance of the explanation. Without a good  explanatory theory, they can simply reinterpret the omens, pick a new  date, and make essentially the same prediction. In such cases, testing  one’s theory and abandoning it when it is refuted constitutes no  progress towards understanding the world. If an explanation could  easily explain anything in the given field, then it actually explains  nothing. In general, when theories are easily variable in the sense I have  described, experimental testing is almost useless for correcting their  errors. I call such theories  bad explanations.  Being proved wrong by  experiment, and changing the theories to other bad explanations, does  not get their holders one jot closer to the truth.  Because explanation plays this central role in science, and because  testability is of little use in the case of bad explanations, I myself prefer  to call myths, superstitions and similar theories  un scientific even when  they make testable predictions. But it does not matter what terminology  you use, so======================================================== on  Earth. Suppose, for instance, that there was a prehistoric continent,  isolated from the others, on which evolution happened several times  as fast as elsewhere, and that, by convergent evolution, a rabbit-like  creature evolved there during the Cambrian era; and suppose that the  continents were later connected by a catastrophe that obliterated most  96 the beginning of infinity of the life forms on that continent and submerged their fossils. The  rabbit-like creature was a rare survivor which became extinct soon  afterwards. Given the supposed evidence, that is still an infinitely better  explanation than, for instance, creationism or Lamarckism, neither of  which gives  any  account of the origin of the apparent knowledge in  the rabbit. So what  would  refute the Darwinian theory of evolution? Evidence  which, in the light of the best available explanation, implies that  knowledge came into existence in a different way. For instance, if    an organism was observed to undergo only (or mainly) favourable  mutations, as predicted by Lamarckism or spontaneous generation,  then Darwinism’s ‘random variation’ postulate would be refuted. If  organisms were observed to be born with new, complex adaptations  – for anything – of which there were no precursors in their parents,  then the gradual-change prediction would be refuted and so would  Darwinism’s mechanism of knowledge-creation. If an organism was  born with a complex adaptation that has survival value today, yet was  not favoured by selection pressure in its ancestry (say, an ability to  detect and use internet weather forecasts to decide when to hibernate),  then Darwinism would again be refuted. A fundamentally new ex    - planation would be needed. Facing more or less the same unsolved  problem that Paley and Darwin faced, we should have to set about  finding an explanation that worked. Fine-tuning The physicist Brandon Carter calculated in 1974 that if the strength  of the interaction between charged particles were a few per cent smaller,  no planets would ever have formed and the only condensed objects in  the universe would be stars; and if it were a few per cent greater, then  no stars would ever explode, and so no elements other than hydrogen  and helium would exist outside them. In either case there would be no  complex chemistry and hence presumably no life. Another example: if the initial expansion rate of the universe at the  Big Bang had been slightly higher, no stars would have formed and  there would be nothing in the universe but hydrogen – at an extremely  low and ever-decreasing density. If it had been slightly lower, the  97 Creation universe would have recollapsed soon after the Big Bang. Similar results  have been since obtained for other constants of physics that are not  determined by any known theory. For most, if not all of them, it seems  that if they had been slightly different, there would have been no  possibility for life to exist. This is a remarkable fact which has even been cited as evidence that  those constants were intentionally fine-tuned, i.e. designed, by a super- natural being. This is a new version of creationism, and of the design  argument, now based on the appearance of design  in the laws of physics .  (Ironically, given the history of this controversy, the new argument is  that the laws of physics must have been designed to create a biosphere  by Darwinian evolution .) It even persuaded the philosopher Antony  Flew – formerly an enthusiastic advocate of atheism – of the existence  of a supernatural designer. But it should not have. As I shall explain in  a moment, it is not even clear that this fine-tuning constitutes an  appearance of design in Paley’s sense; but, even if it does, that does    not alter the fact that invoking the supernatural makes for a bad  explanation. And, in any case, arguing for supernatural explanations  on the grounds that a current scientific explanation is flawed or lacking  is just a mistake. As we carved in stone in Chapter 3, problems are  inevitable – there are always unsolved problems. But they get solved.  Science continues to make progress even, or especially, after making  great discoveries, because the discoveries themselves reveal further  problems. Therefore the existence of an unsolved problem in physics  is no more evidence for a supernatural explanation than the existence  of an unsolved crime is evidence that a ghost committed it.  A simple objection to the idea that fine-tuning requires an explanation  at all is that we have no good explanation implying that planets are  essential to the formation of life, or that chemistry is. The physicist  Robert Forward wrote a superb science-fiction story,  Dragon’s Egg ,  based on the premise that information could be stored and processed  – and life and intelligence could evolve – through the interactions  between neutrons on the surface of a neutron star (a star that has  collapsed gravitationally to a diameter of only a======================================================== it misses and the rest strikes everywhere on  the exposed surface. Remember, this is just a single particle, which may  consist of fungible instances. The next thing that happens is that they  cease to be fungible, splitting through their interaction with atoms at  their points of arrival into a finite but huge number of instances, each  of which is the origin of a separate history. 294 the beginning of infinity In each such history, there is an autonomous instance of the cosmic- ray particle, which will dissipate its energy in creating a ‘cosmic-ray  shower’ of electrically charged particles. Thus, in different histories,  such a shower will occur at different locations. In some, that shower  will provide a conducting path down which a lightning bolt will travel.  Every atom on the surface of the Earth will be struck by such lightning  in  some  history. In other histories, one of those cosmic-ray particles  will strike a human cell, damaging some already damaged DNA in  such a way as to make the cell cancerous. Some non-negligible pro  - portion of all cancers are caused in this way. As a result, there exist  histories in which any given person, alive in our history at any time,  is killed soon afterwards by cancer. There exist other histories in which  the course of a battle, or a war, is changed by such an event, or by a  lightning bolt at exactly the right place and time, or by any of countless  other unlikely, ‘random’ events. This makes it highly plausible that  there exist histories in which events have played out more or less as  in alternative-history stories such as  Fatherland  and  Roma Eterna  – or  in which events in your own life played out very differently, for better  or worse. A great deal of fiction is therefore close to a fact somewhere in the  multiverse. But not all fiction. For instance, there are no histories in  which my stories of the transporter malfunction are true, because they  require different laws of physics. Nor are there histories in which the  fundamental constants of nature such as the speed of light or the charge  on an electron are different. There is, however, a sense in which different  laws of physics  appear  to be true for a period in some histories, because  of a sequence of ‘unlikely accidents’. (There may also be universes in  which there are different laws of physics, as required in anthropic  explanations of fine-tuning. But as yet there is no viable theory of such  a multiverse.) Imagine a single photon from a starship’s communication laser,  heading towards Earth. Like the cosmic ray, it arrives all over the  surface, in different histories. In each history, only one atom will absorb  the photon and the rest will initially be completely unaffected. A receiver  for such communications would then detect the relatively large, discrete  change undergone by such an atom. An important consequence for the  construction of measuring devices (including eyes) is that no matter  295 The Multiverse how far away the source is, the kick given to an atom by an arriving  photon is always the same: it is just that the weaker the signal is, the  fewer kicks there are. If this were not so – for instance, if classical physics  were true – weak signals would be much more easily swamped by  random local noise. This is the same as the advantage of digital over  analogue information processing that I discussed in Chapter 6. Some of my own research in physics has been concerned with the  theory of  quantum computers . These are computers in which the  information-carrying variables have been protected by a variety of  means from becoming entangled with their surroundings. This allows  a new mode of computation in which the flow of information is not  confined to a single history. In one type of quantum computation,  enormous numbers of different computations, taking place simul- taneously, can affect each other and hence contribute to the output of  a computation. This is known as  quantum parallelism . In a typical quantum computation, individual bits of information are  represented in physical objects known as ‘qubits’ – quantum bits – of  which there is a large variety of physical implementations but always  with two essential features. First, each qubit has a variable that can take  one of two discrete values, and, second, special measures are taken to  protect the qubits from entanglement – such as cooling them to  temperatures close to absolute zero. A typical algorithm using quantum  parallelism begins by causing the information-carrying variables in some  of the qubits to acquire both their values simultaneously. Con    sequently,  regarding those qubits as a register representing (say) a number, the  number of separate instances of the register as a whole is exponentially  large: two to the power of the number of qubits. Then, for a period,  classical computations are performed, during which waves of  differentiation spread to some of the other qubits – but no further,======================================================== if they were slightly altered they would  serve it less well, or not at all. A good design is  hard to vary : If the different parts had been differently shaped from what they are, of  a different size from what they are, or placed after any other manner, or  in any other order, than that in which they are placed, either no motion  at all would have been carried on in the machine, or none which would  have answered the use that is now served by it. 86 the beginning of infinity Merely being useful for a purpose, without being hard to vary while  still serving that purpose, is not a sign of adaptation or design. For  instance, one can also use the sun to keep time, but all its features  would serve that purpose equally well if slightly (or even massively)  altered. Just as we transform many of the Earth’s non-adapted raw  materials to meet our purposes, so we also find uses for the sun that  it was never designed or adapted to provide. The knowledge, in that  case, is entirely in us – and in our sundials – not in the sun. But it  is  embodied in the watch, and in the mouse. So, how did all that knowledge come to be embodied in those things?  As I said, Paley could conceive of only one explanation. That was his  first mistake: The inference we think is inevitable, that the watch must have had a   maker . . . There cannot be design without a designer; contrivance without  a contriver; order without choice; arrangement without anything capable  of arranging; subserviency and relation to a purpose without that which  could intend a purpose; means suitable to an end . . . without the end ever  having been contemplated or the means accommodated to it. Arrangement,  disposition of parts, subserviency of means to an end, relation of instru- ments to a use imply the presence of intelligence and mind. We now know that there  can  be ‘design without a designer’: know  ledge  without a person who created it. Some types of knowledge can be  created by evolution. I shall come to that shortly. But it is no criticism  of Paley that he was unaware of a discovery that had yet to be made  – one of the greatest discoveries in the history of science.  However, although Paley was spot on in his understanding of the  problem , he somehow did not realize that his proposed solution,  creationism, does not solve it, and is even ruled out by his own argu- ment. For the ultimate designer for whose existence Paley was arguing  would also be a purposeful and complex entity – certainly no less so  than a watch or a living organism. Hence, as many critics have since  noticed, if we substitute ‘ultimate designer’ for ‘watch’ in Paley’s text  above, we force Paley to ‘the [inevitable] inference . . . that the ultimate  designer must have had a maker’. Since that is a contradiction, the  argument from design as perfected by Paley rules out the existence of  an ultimate designer. 87 Creation Note that this is not a disproof of the existence of God, any more  than the original argument was a proof. But it does show that, in any  good explanation of the origin of biological adaptations, God cannot  play the role assigned by creationism. Though this is the opposite of  what Paley believed he had achieved, none of us can choose what our  ideas imply. His argument has universal reach for anything that has,  by his criterion, the appearance of design. As an elucidation of the  special status of living things, and in setting a benchmark that ex    - planations of knowledge-laden entities must meet if they are to make  sense, it is essential to understanding the world. Lamarckism Before Darwin’s theory of evolution, people had already been wonder- ing whether the biosphere and its adaptations might have come into  existence gradually. Darwin’s grandfather Erasmus Darwin (1731– 1802), a stalwart of the Enlightenment, was among them. They called  that process ‘evolution’, but the meaning of the word then was different  from its primary one today.  All  processes of gradual improvement,  regardless of their mechan  ism, were known as ‘evolution’. (That  terminology survives to this day in casual usage and as a technical term  in, of all places, theoretical physics, where ‘evolution’ means any sort  of continuous change that one is explaining through laws of physics.)  Charles Darwin distinguished the process that he discovered by calling  it ‘evolution by natural selection’ – though a better name would have  been ‘evolution by variation and selection’. As Paley might well have recognized if he had lived to hear of it,  ‘evolution by natural selection’ is a much more substantive mode of  explanation than mere ‘evolution’. For the latter does not solve his  problem, while the former does.  Any  theory about improvement raises  the question: how is the knowledge of how to make that improvement  created? Was it already present at the outset? The theory that it was is  creationism. Did it ‘just happen’? The theory that it did is spontaneous  generation. During======================================================== refer only to the internal organization of chemical scum.  So how can it tell us anything about how the world  beyond  the scum  is organized, as the Principle of Mediocrity purports to do?  In any case, it was not arrogance that made people adopt anthro- pocentric explanations. It was merely a parochial error, and quite a  reasonable one originally. Nor was it arrogance that prevented people  from realizing their mistake for so long: they didn’t realize  anything ,  because they did not know how to seek better explanations. In a sense  52 the beginning of infinity their whole problem was that they were not arrogant  enough : they  assumed far too easily that the world was fundamentally incompre- hensible to them.  The misconception that there was once an unproblematic era for  humans is present in ancient myths of a past Golden Age, and of a  Garden of Eden. The theological notions of  grace  (unearned benefit  from God) and  Providence  (which is God regarded as the provider of  human needs) are also related to this. In order to connect the supposed  unproblematic past with their own less-than-pleasant experiences, the  authors of such myths had to include some past transition, such as a  Fall from Grace when Providence reduced its level of support. In the  Spaceship Earth metaphor, the Fall from Grace is usually deemed to  be imminent or under way.  The Principle of Mediocrity contains a similar misconception. Consider  the following argument, which is due to the evolutionary biologist  Richard Dawkins: Human attributes, like those of all other organisms,  evolved under natural selection in an ancestral environment. That is why  our senses are adapted to detecting things like the colours and smell of  fruit, or the sound of a predator: being able to detect such things gave  our ancestors a better chance of surviving to have offspring. But, for the  same reason, Dawkins points out, evolution did not waste our resources  on detecting phenomena that were never relevant to our survival. We  cannot, for instance, distinguish between the colours of most stars with  the naked eye. Our night vision is poor and monochromatic because  not enough of our ancestors died of that limitation to create evolutionary  pressure for anything better. So Dawkins argues – and here he is invoking  the Principle of Mediocrity – that there is no reason to expect our brains  to be any different from our eyes in this regard: they evolved to cope  with the narrow class of phenomena that commonly occur in the bio  - sphere, on approximately human scales of size, time, energy and so on.  Most phenomena in the universe happen far above or below those scales.  Some would kill us instantly; others could never affect anything in the  lives of early humans. So, just as our senses cannot  detect  neutrinos or  quasars or most other significant phenomena in the cosmic scheme of  things, there is no reason to expect our brains to  understand  them. To  the extent that they already do understand them, we have been lucky  – but a run of luck cannot be expected to continue for long. Hence  53 The Spark Dawkins agrees with an earlier evolutionary biologist, John Haldane,  who expected that ‘the universe is not only queerer than we suppose,  but queerer than we  can  suppose.’  That is a startling – and paradoxical – consequence of the Principle  of Mediocrity: it says that all human abilities, including the distinctive  ones such as the ability to create new explanations, are necessarily  parochial. That implies, in particular, that progress in science cannot  exceed a certain limit defined by the biology of the human brain. And  we must expect to reach that limit sooner rather than later. Beyond  it, the world stops making sense (or seems to). The answer to the  question that I asked at the end of Chapter 2 – whether the scientific  revolution and the broader Enlightenment could be a beginning of  infinity – would then be a resounding no. Science, for all its successes  and aspirations, would turn out to be inherently parochial – and,  ironically, anthropocentric.  So here the Principle of Mediocrity and Spaceship Earth converge.  They share a conception of a tiny, human-friendly bubble embedded in  the alien and uncooperative universe. The Spaceship Earth metaphor  sees it as a physical bubble, the biosphere. For the Principle of Mediocrity,  the bubble is primarily conceptual, marking the limits of the human  capacity to understand the world. Those two bubbles are related, as we  shall see. In both views, anthropocentrism is true in the interior of the  bubble: there the world is unproblematic, uniquely compliant with  human wishes and human understanding. Outside it there are only  insoluble problems. Dawkins would prefer it to be otherwise.

We happened to get round to  testing Newton’s laws in the seventeenth century, and Einstein’s in the  twentieth, but the evidence with which we did that – light from the  sky – had been deluging the surface of the Earth for billions of years  before that, and will continue to do so for billions more. Even today  we have barely begun to examine that evidence: on any clear night,  the chances are that your roof will be struck by evidence falling from  the sky which, if you only knew what to look for and how, would    win you a Nobel prize. In chemistry, every stable element that exists  62 the beginning of infinity anywhere is also present on or just below the Earth’s surface. In biology,  copious evidence of the nature of life is ubiquitous in the biosphere  – and within arm’s reach, in our own DNA. As far as we know,    all the fundamental constants of nature can be measured here, and    every fundamental law can be tested here. Everything needed for the    open-ended creation of knowledge is here in abundance, in the Earth’s  biosphere.  And the same is true of the moon. It has essentially the same resources  of mass, energy and evidence as the Earth has. Parochial details differ,  but the fact that humans living on the moon will have to make their  own air is no more significant than the fact that laboratories on Earth  have to make their own vacuum. Both tasks can be automated so as to  require arbitrarily little human effort or attention. Likewise, because  humans are universal constructors,  every  problem of finding or trans- form    ing resources can be no more than a transient factor limiting the  creation of knowledge in a given environment. And therefore matter,  energy and evidence are the only requirements that an environment  needs to have in order to be a venue for open-ended knowledge creation. Though any particular problem is a transient factor, the condition  of having to solve problems in order to survive and continue to create  knowledge is permanent. I have mentioned that there has never been  an unproblematic time for humans; that applies as much to the future  as to the past. Today on Earth, in the short run, there are still countless  problems to be solved to eliminate even starvation and other forms of  extreme human suffering that date back to prehistory. On a timescale  of decades, we shall be faced with choices to make substantial modifi- cations to the biosphere, or to keep it the same, or anything in between.  Whichever option we choose, it will be a project of planet-wide control,  requiring the creation of a great deal of scientific and tech  nological  knowledge as well as knowledge about how to make such decisions  rationally (see Chapter 13). In the even longer run, it is not only our  comfort and aesthetic sensibilities, and the suffering of individ  uals,  that are problematic, but, as always, the survival of our species. For  instance, at present during any given century there is about one chance  in a thousand that the Earth will be struck by a comet or asteroid large  enough to kill at least a substantial proportion of all human beings.  That means that a typical child born in the United States today is more  63 The Spark likely to die as a result of an astronomical event than a car accident.  Both are very low-probability events, but, unless we create a great deal  more scientific and technological knowledge than we have now, we  shall have no defence against those and other forms of natural disaster  that must, eventually, strike. Arguably there are more immediate  existential threats too – see Chapter 9. Setting up self-sufficient colonies on the moon and elsewhere in the  solar system – and eventually in other solar systems – will be a good  hedge against the extinction of our species or the destruction of civil- ization, and is a highly desirable goal for that reason among others.  As Hawking has said: I don’t think the human race will survive the next thousand years, unless  we spread into space. There are too many accidents that can befall life  on a single planet. But I’m an optimist. We will reach out to the stars. Daily Telegraph , 16 October 2001 But even that will be far from an unproblematic state. And most people  are not satisfied merely to be confident in the survival of the  species :  they want to survive personally. Also, like our earliest human ancestors,  they want to be free from physical danger and suffering. In future, as  various causes of suffering and death such as disease and ageing are  successively addressed and eliminated, and human life spans increase,  people will care about ever longer-term risks.  In fact people will always want still more than that: they will want  to make progress. For, in addition to threats, there will always be  problems in the benign sense of the word: errors, gaps, inconsistencies  and inadequacies in our knowledge that we wish to solve – including,  not least, moral knowledge: knowledge about======================================================== forbidden by the laws  of physics (such as replanting a forest) can only be a matter of knowing  425 Unsustainable how. We know that finding out how is a matter of seeking good  explanations. We also know that whether a particular attempt to make  progress will succeed or not is profoundly unpredictable. It can be  understood in retrospect, but not in terms of factors that could have  been known in advance. Thus we now understand why alchemists never  succeeded at transmutation: because they would have had to understand  some nuclear physics first. But this could not have been known at the  time. And the progress that they did make – which led to the science  of chemistry – depended strongly on how individual alchemists  thought ,  and only peripherally on factors like which chemicals could be found  nearby. The conditions for a beginning of infinity exist in almost every  human habitation on Earth. In his book  Guns, Germs and Steel , the biogeographer Jared Diamond  takes the opposite view. He proposes what he calls an ‘ultimate ex    - planation’ of why human history was so different on different con  - tinents. In particular, he seeks to explain why it was Europeans who  sailed out to conquer the Americas, Australasia and Africa and not vice  versa. In Diamond’s view, the psychology and philosophy and politics  of historical events are no more than ephemeral ripples on the great  river of history. Its course is set by factors independent of human ideas  and decisions. Specifically, he says, the continents on our planet had  different natural resources – different geographies, plants, animals and  micro-organisms – and, details aside, that is what explains the broad  sweep of history, including which human ideas were created and what  decisions were made, politics, philosophy, cutlery and all. For example, part of his explanation of why the Americas never  developed a technological civilization before the advent of Europeans  is that there were no animals there suitable for domestication as beasts  of burden. Llamas are native to South America, and have been used as beasts of  burden since prehistoric times, so Diamond points out that they are  not native to the continent as a whole, but only to the Andes mountains.  Why did no technological civilization arise in the Andes mountains?  Why did the Incan Empire not have an Enlightenment? Diamond’s  position is that other biogeographical factors were unfavourable.  The communist thinker Friedrich Engels proposed the same ultimate  426 the beginning of infinity explanation of history, and made the same proviso about llamas,    in 1884: The Eastern Hemisphere . . . possessed nearly all the animals adaptable  to domestication . . . The Western Hemisphere, America, had no mammals  that could be domesticated except the llama, which, moreover, was only  found in one part of South America . . . Owing to these differences in  natural conditions, the population of each hemisphere now goes on its  own way . . . The Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State (Friedrich Engels, based on notes by Karl Marx) But why did llamas  continue  to be ‘only found in one part of South  America’, if they could have been useful elsewhere? Engels did not  address that issue. But Diamond realized that it ‘cries out for explan- ation’. Because, unless the reason that llamas were not exported was  itself biogeographical, Diamond’s ‘ultimate explanation’ is false. So he  proposed a biogeographical reason: he pointed out that a hot, lowland  region, unsuitable for llamas, separates the Andes from the highlands  of Central America where llamas would have been useful in agriculture. But, again,  why  must such a region have been a barrier to the spread  of domesticated llamas? Traders travelled between South and Central  America for centuries, perhaps overland and certainly by sea. Where  there are long-range traders, it is not necessary for an idea to be useful  in an unbroken line of places for it to be able to spread. As I remarked  in Chapter 11, knowledge has the unique ability to take aim at a distant  427 Unsustainable target and utterly transform it while having scarcely any effect on the  space between. So, what would it have taken for some of those traders  to take some llamas north for sale? Only the idea: the leap of imagin- ation to guess that if something is useful here, it might be useful there  too. And the boldness to take the speculative and physical risk.  Polynesian traders did exactly that. They ranged further, across a more  formidable natural barrier, carrying goods including livestock. Why  did none of the South American traders ever think of selling llamas to  the Central Americans? We may never know – but why should it have  had anything to do with geography? They may simply have been too  set in their ways. Perhaps innovative uses for animals were taboo.  Perhaps such a trade was attempted, but failed every time because of  sheer bad luck. But, whatever======================================================== found in the current user’s input. Weizenbaum was shocked that many people using  Eliza  were fooled  by it. So it had passed the Turing test – at least, in its most naive version.  Moreover, even after people had been told that it was not a genuine  AI, they would sometimes continue to have long conversations with it  about their personal problems, exactly as though they believed that it  understood them. Weizenbaum wrote a book,  Computer Power and  Human Reason  (1976), warning of the dangers of anthropomorphism  when computers seem to exhibit human-like functionality. However, anthropomorphism is not the main type of overconfidence  that has beset the field of AI. For example, in 1983 Douglas Hofstadter  was subjected to a friendly hoax by some graduate students. They  convinced him that they had obtained access to a government-run AI  program, and invited him to apply the Turing test to it. In reality, one  of the students was at the other end of the line, imitating an  Eliza  program. As Hofstadter relates in his book  Metamagical Themas   (1985), the student was from the outset displaying an implausible  degree of understanding of Hofstadter’s questions. For example, an  early exchange was: 150 the beginning of infinity hofstadter : What are ears? student : Ears are auditory organs found on animals. That is not a dictionary definition. So  something  must have processed  the meaning of the word ‘ears’ in a way that distinguished it from most  other nouns. Any one such exchange is easily explained as being due  to luck: the question must have matched one of the templates that the  programmer had provided, including customized information about  ears. But after half a dozen exchanges on different subjects, phrased  in different ways, such luck becomes a very bad explanation and the  game should have been up. But it was not. So the student became ever  bolder in his replies, until eventually he was making jokes directed  specifically at Hofstadter – which gave him away. As Hofstadter remarked, ‘In retrospect, I am quite amazed at how  much genuine intelligence I was willing to accept as somehow having  been implanted in the program . . . It is clear that I was willing to accept  a huge amount of fluidity as achievable in this day and age simply by  putting together a large bag of isolated tricks, kludges and hacks.’ The  fact was (and this alone should have alerted Hofstadter) that, nineteen  years after  Eliza , not one of the  Eliza -like programs of the day resembled  a person even slightly more than the original had. Although they were  able to parse sentences better, and had more pre-programmed templates  for questions and answers, that is almost no help in an extended  conversation on diverse subjects. The probability that the outputs of  such templates will continue to resemble the products of human  thought diminishes exponentially with the number of utterances. So  Hofstadter should have been able to pronounce quite soon that the  candidate had passed the Turing test – and that, because it nevertheless  sounded rather like  Eliza , it must be a person pretending to be a  computer program. Programs written today – a further twenty-six years later – are still  no better at the task of seeming to think than  Eliza  was. They are now  known as ‘chatbots’, and their main application is still amusement, both  directly and in computer games. They have also been used to pro            vide  friendly seeming interfaces to lists of ‘frequently asked questions’ about  subjects like how to operate computers. But I think that users find them  no more helpful than a searchable list of the questions and answers. In 1990 the inventor Hugh Loebner endowed a prize for passing the  151 Artificial Creativity Turing test, to be judged at an annual competition. Until the test is  passed, a lesser prize is awarded each year for the entry judged to be  closest to passing. The test is harder to implement than it may seem at  first. One issue is that requiring the program to  pretend  to be human  is both biased and not very relevant to whether it can think .  Yet, if it  does not pretend to be human, it will be easy to identify as a computer  regardless of its ability to think. A related difficulty is that the human  participant in the test might intentionally imitate a chatbot – as in the  Hofstadter hoax – and so spoil the test, which is based on comparing  the two. Should the rules nevertheless allow the human to do this, in  order to mitigate the previous problem?  Unfortunately, such subtleties are not relevant at the current state  of the art. This is well illustrated by the following excerpts from the  conversation with which the program  Elbot  won the (lesser) Loebner  prize in 2008: judge :   do you understand the point of a turing test? elbot :   There are some people who would not pass the Turing  test themselves. Why must they inflict it on  computers? judge :  I spose it is a little harsh elbot :   If we
