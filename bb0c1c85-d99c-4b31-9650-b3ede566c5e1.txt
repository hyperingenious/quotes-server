======================================================== unrealistically – that none  of the decision-makers in the group is able to persuade the others to  modify their preferences, or to create new preferences that are easier  to agree on. The realistic case is that neither the preferences nor the  options need be the same at the end of a decision-making process as  they were at the beginning. Why don’t they just . . . fix social-choice theory by including creative  processes such as explanation and persuasion in its mathematical model  of decision-making? Because it is not known how to model a creative  process. Such a model would  be  a creative process: an AI.  The conditions of ‘fairness’ as conceived in the various social-choice  problems are misconceptions analogous to empiricism: they are all  about the  input  to the decision-making process – who participates,  and how their opinions are integrated to form the ‘preference of the  group’. A rational analysis must concentrate instead on how the rules  and institutions contribute to the  removal  of bad policies and rulers,  and to the creation of new options. 346 the beginning of infinity Sometimes such an analysis does endorse one of the traditional  requirements, at least in part. For instance, it is indeed important that  no member of the group be privileged or deprived of representation.  But this is not so that all members can contribute to the answer. It is  because such discrimination entrenches in the system a preference  among their potential  criticisms . It does not make sense to  include   everyone’s favoured policies, or parts of them, in the new decision;  what is necessary for progress is to  exclude  ideas that fail to survive  criticism, and to prevent their entrenchment, and to promote the  creation of new ideas. Proportional representation is often defended on the grounds that  it leads to coalition governments and compromise policies. But com  - promises – amalgams of the policies of the contributors – have an  undeservedly high reputation. Though they are certainly better than  immediate violence, they are generally, as I have explained, bad policies.  If a policy is no one’s idea of what will work, then why should it work?  But that is not the worst of it. The key defect of compromise policies  is that when one of them is implemented and fails, no one learns  anything because no one ever agreed with it. Thus compromise policies  shield the underlying explanations which  do  at least seem good to some  faction from being criticized and abandoned. The system used to elect members of the legislatures of most countries  in the British political tradition is that each district (or ‘constituency’)  in the country is entitled to one seat in the legislature, and that seat goes  to the candidate with the largest number of votes in that district. This  is called the  plurality voting  system (‘plurality’ meaning ‘largest number  of votes’) – often called the ‘first-past-the-post’ system, because there is  no prize for any runner-up, and no second round of voting (both of  which feature in other electoral systems for the sake of increasing the  proportionality of the outcomes). Plurality voting typically ‘over- represents’ the two largest parties, compared with the proportion of  votes they receive. Moreover, it is not guaranteed to avoid the population  paradox, and is even capable of bringing one party to power when  another has received far more votes in total.  These features are often cited as arguments against plurality voting  and in favour of a more proportional system – either literal proportional  representation or other schemes such as transferable-vote systems and  347 Choices run-off systems which have the effect of making the representation of  voters in the legislature more proportional. However, under Popper’s  criterion, that is all insignificant in comparison with the greater    ef      fective    ness of plurality voting at removing bad governments and  policies. Let me trace the mechanism of that advantage more explicitly.  Following a plurality-voting election, the usual outcome is that the  party with the largest total number of votes has an overall majority in  the legislature, and therefore takes sole charge. All the losing parties  are removed entirely from power. This is rare under proportional  representation, because some of the parties in the old coalition are  usually needed in the new one. Consequently, the logic of plurality is  that politicians and political parties have little chance of gaining any  share in power unless they can persuade a substantial proportion of  the population to vote for them. That gives all parties the incentive to  find better explanations, or at least to convince more people of their  existing ones, for if they fail they will be relegated to powerlessness at  the next election.  In the plurality system, the winning explanations are then exposed to  criticism and testing, because they can be implemented without mixing  them with the======================================================== that much harder than imitating  only the first instance; the student’s much easier, because to a human  observer each different way of putting the idea would convey additional  knowledge. Alternatively, suppose that the lecturer had consistently  misspoken in a way that altered the meaning, and had then made one  correction at the end. The parrot would copy the wrong version. The  student would not. Even if the lecturer never corrected the error at all,  a human listener might still have a good chance of understanding the  410 the beginning of infinity idea that was in the lecturer’s mind – and, again, without imitating any  behaviour. If someone else reported the lecture but in a way that  contained severe misconceptions, a human listener might  still  be able  to detect what the lecturer meant, by explaining the reporter’s miscon- ceptions as well as the lecturer’s intention – just as a conjuring expert  might be able to detect what really happened during a trick given only  a false account from the audience of what they saw. Rather than imitating behaviour, a human being tries to explain it  – to understand the ideas that caused it – which is a special case of the  general human objective of explaining the world. When we succeed in  explaining someone’s behaviour, and we approve of the underlying  intention, we may subsequently behave ‘like’ that person in the relevant  sense. But if we disapprove, we might behave unlike that person. Since  creating explanations is second nature (or, rather, first nature) to us,  we can easily misconstrue the process of acquiring a meme as ‘imitating  what we see’. Using our explanations, we ‘see’ right through the be    - haviour to the meaning. Parrots copy distinctive sounds; apes copy  purposeful movements of a certain limited class. But humans do not  especially copy any behaviour. They use conjecture, criticism and  experiment to create good explanations of the meaning of things – other  people’s behaviour, their own, and that of the world in general. That  is what creativity does. And if we end up behaving like other people,  it is because we have rediscovered the same idea. That is why the audience at a lecture, when striving to assimilate the  lecturer’s memes, are not tempted to face the rear wall of the lecture  room, or to imitate the lecturer in any one of infinitely many other  ways. They reject such interpretations of what is worth copying about  the lecturer not because they are genetically incapable of conceiving    of them, as other animals are, but because they are bad explanations  of what the lecturer is doing, and bad ideas by the audience’s own  values. Both puzzles have the same solution In this chapter I have presented two puzzles. The first is why human  creativity was evolutionarily advantageous at a time when there was  almost no innovation. The second is how human memes can possibly  411 The Evolution of Creativity be replicated, given that they have content that the recipient never  observes. I think that both those puzzles have the same solution: what replicates  human memes is creativity; and creativity was used, while it was  evolving,  to replicate memes . In other words, it was used to acquire  existing knowledge, not to create new knowledge. But  the mechanism  to do both things is identical , and so in acquiring the ability to do  the former, we automatically became able to do the latter. It was a  momentous example of reach, which made possible everything that is  uniquely human. A person acquiring a meme faces the same logical challenge as a  scientist. Both must discover a hidden explanation. For the former, it  is an idea in the minds of other people; for the latter, a regularity or  law of nature. Neither person has direct access to this explanation. But  both have access to evidence with which explanations can be tested:  the observed behaviour of people who hold the meme, and physical  phenomena conforming to the law.  The puzzle of how one can possibly translate behaviour back into a  theory that contains its meaning is therefore the same puzzle as where  scientific knowledge comes from. And the idea that memes are copied  by imitating their holders’ behaviour is the same mistake as empiricism  or inductivism or Lamarckism. They all depend on there being a way  of automatically translating  problems  (like the problem of planetary  motions, or of how to reach leaves on tall trees or to be invisible to    one’s prey) into their solutions. In other words, they assume that the  environment (in the form of an observed phenomenon, or a tall tree,  say) can ‘instruct’ minds or genomes in how to meet its challenges.  Popper wrote: The inductivist or Lamarckian approach operates with the idea of  instruction from without, or from the environment. But the critical or  Darwinian approach only allows instruction from within – from within  the structure itself . . . I contend that there is no such thing as instruction from without the======================================================== of these axioms are  intuitively not just desirable to make a system fair, but essential for it  to be rational. Yet they are inconsistent. It seems to follow that a group of people jointly making decisions  is necessarily irrational in one way or another. It may be a dictatorship,  or under some sort of arbitrary rule; or, if it meets all three represen- tativeness conditions, then it must sometimes change its ‘mind’ in a  direction opposite to that in which criticism and persuasion have been  effective. So it will make perverse choices, no matter how wise and  benevolent the people who interpret and enforce its preferences may  be – unless, possibly, one of them is a dictator (see below). So there is  no such thing as ‘the will of the people’. There is no way to regard  338 the beginning of infinity ‘society’ as a decision-maker with self-consistent preferences. This is  hardly the conclusion that social-choice theory was supposed to report  back to the world.   As with the apportionment problem, there were attempts to fix the  implications of Arrow’s theorem with ‘why don’t they just . . . ?’ ideas.  For instance, why not take into account  how intense  people’s preferences  are? For, if slightly over half the electorate barely prefers X to Y, but  the rest consider it a matter of life and death that Y should be done,  then most intuitive conceptions of representative government would  designate Y as ‘the will of the people’. But intensities of preferences,  and especially the differences in intensities among different people, or  between the same person at different times, are notoriously difficult to  define, let alone measure – like happiness. And, in any case, including  such things makes no difference: there are still no-go theorems. As with the apportionment problem, it seems that whenever one  patches up a decision-making system in one way, it becomes paradox- ical in another. A further serious problem that has been identified in  many decision-making institutions is that they create incentives for  participants to lie about their preferences. For instance, if there are two  options of which you mildly prefer one, you have an incentive to  register your preference as ‘strong’ instead. Perhaps you are prevented  from doing that by a sense of civic responsibility. But a decision-making  system moderated by civic responsibility has the defect that it gives  disproportionate weight to the opinions of people who  lack  civic  responsibility and are willing to lie. On the other hand, a society in  which everyone knows everyone sufficiently well to make such lying  difficult cannot have an effectively secret ballot, and the system will  then give disproportionate weight to the faction most able to intimidate  waverers. One perennially controversial social-choice problem is that of de    - vising an electoral system. Such a system is mathematically similar to  an apportionment scheme, but, instead of allocating seats to states on  the basis of population, it allocates them to candidates (or parties) on  the basis of votes. However, it is more paradoxical than apportionment  and has more serious consequences, because in the case of elections  the element of  persuasion  is central to the whole exercise: an election  is supposed to determine what the voters have become persuaded of.  339 Choices (In contrast, apportionment is not about states trying to persuade  people to migrate from other states.) Consequently an electoral system  can contribute to, or can inhibit, traditions of criticism in the society  concerned.  For example, an electoral system in which seats are allocated wholly  or partly in proportion to the number of votes received by each party  is called a ‘proportional-representation’ system. We know from Balinski  and Young that, if an electoral system is too proportional, it will be  subject to the analogue of the population paradox and other paradoxes.  And indeed the political scientist Peter Kurrild-Klitgaard, in a study  of the most recent eight general elections in Denmark (under its  proportional-representation system), showed that every one of them  manifested paradoxes. These included the ‘More-Preferred-Less-Seats  paradox’, in which a majority of voters prefer party X to party Y, but  party Y receives more seats than party X.  But that is really the least of the irrational attributes of proportional  representation. A more important one – which is shared by even the  mildest of proportional systems – is that they assign  dis proportionate  power in the legislature to the  third-largest party , and often to even  smaller parties. It works like this. It is rare (in any system) for a    single party to receive an overall majority of votes. Hence, if votes are  reflected proportionately in the legislature, no legislation can be passed  unless some of the parties cooperate to pass it, and no government can  be formed unless some of them form a coalition.

You can also predict that  when you first see a clear daytime sky after being cured you will  experience a similar quale to that of seeing the blue card. But there is  one thing that neither you nor anyone else could predict about the  outcome of this experiment, and that is:  what blue will look like . Qualia  are currently neither describable nor predictable – a unique property  that should make them deeply problematic to anyone with a scientific  world view (though, in the event, it seems to be mainly philosophers  who worry about it).  I consider this exciting evidence that there is a fundamental discovery  to be made which will integrate things like qualia into our other  154 the beginning of infinity knowledge. Daniel Dennett draws the opposite conclusion, namely  that qualia do not exist! His claim is not, strictly speaking, that they  are an illusion – for an illusion of a quale would be that quale. It    is that we have a  mistaken belief . Our introspection – which is an  inspection of  memories  of our experiences, including memories dating  back only a fraction of a second – has evolved to report that we have  experienced qualia, but those are false memories. One of Dennett’s  books defending this theory is called  Consciousness Explained . Some  other philosophers have wryly remarked that  Consciousness Denied  would be a more accurate name. I agree, because, although any true  explanation of qualia will have to meet the challenge of Dennett’s  criticisms of the common-sense theory that they exist, simply to deny  their existence is a bad explanation: anything at all could be denied  by that method. If it is true, it will have to be substantiated by a good  explanation of how and why those mistaken beliefs  seem  fundament- ally different from other false beliefs, such as that the Earth is at rest  beneath our feet. But that looks, to me, just like the original problem  of qualia again: we seem to have them; it seems impossible to describe  what they seem to be.  One day, we shall. Problems are soluble. By the way, some abilities of humans that are commonly included  in that constellation associated with general-purpose intelligence do  not belong in it. One of them is  self-awareness  – as evidenced by such  tests as recognizing oneself in a mirror. Some people are unaccountably  impressed when various animals are shown to have that ability. But  there is nothing mysterious about it: a simple pattern-recognition  program would confer it on a computer. The same is true of tool    use, the use of language for signalling (though not for conversation in    the Turing-test sense), and various emotional responses (though not  the associated qualia). At the present state of the field, a useful rule    of thumb is: if it can already be programmed, it has nothing to do    with intelligence in Turing’s sense. Conversely, I have settled on a    simple test for judging claims, including Dennett’s, to have explained  the nature of consciousness (or any other computational task):  if you  can’t program it, you haven’t understood it . Turing invented his test in the hope of bypassing all those philosophical  problems. In other words, he hoped that the functionality could be  155 Artificial Creativity achieved before it was explained. Unfortunately it is very rare for  practical solutions to fundamental problems to be discovered without  any explanation of why they work.  Nevertheless, rather like empiricism, which it resembles, the  idea  of  the Turing test has played a valuable role. It has provided a focus for  explaining the significance of universality and for criticizing the ancient,  anthropocentric assumptions that would rule out the possibility of AI.  Turing himself systematically refuted all the classic objections in that  seminal paper (and some absurd ones for good measure). But his test  is rooted in the empiricist mistake of seeking a purely behavioural  criterion: it requires the judge to come to a conclusion without any  explanation of how the candidate AI is supposed to work. But, in reality,  judging whether something is a genuine AI will always depend on  explanations of how it works.  That is because the task of the judge in a Turing test has similar logic  to that faced by Paley when walking across his heath and finding a  stone, a watch or a living organism: it is to explain how the observable  features of the object came about. In the case of the Turing test, we  deliberately ignore the issue of how the knowledge to  design  the object  was created. The test is only about who designed the AI’s  utterances :  who adapted its utterances to be meaningful – who created the know- ledge in them? If it was the designer, then the program is not an AI. If  it was the program itself, then it is an AI. This issue occasionally arises in regard to humans themselves. For======================================================== rats, not tree-felling) until it was destroyed  by epidemics, caused by contact with Europeans. However, I do not  want to discuss whether the prevailing theory is accurate, but only to  use it as an example of a common fallacy – an argument by analogy  about issues far less parochial. Easter Island is 2,000 kilometres from the nearest habitation, namely  Pitcairn Island (where the  Bounty’ s crew took refuge after their famous  419 Unsustainable mutiny). Both islands are far from anywhere, even by today’s standards.  Nevertheless, in 1972 Jacob Bronowski made his way to Easter Island  to film part of his magnificent television series  The Ascent of Man . He  and his film crew travelled by ship all the way from California, a round  trip of some 14,000 kilometres. He was in poor health, and the crew  had literally to carry him to the location for filming. But he persevered  because those distinctive statues were the perfect setting for him to  deliver the central message of his series – which is also a theme of this  book – that our civilization is unique in history for its capacity to make  progress. He wanted to celebrate its values and achievements, and to  attribute the latter to the former, and to contrast our civilization with  the alternative as epitomized by ancient Easter Island. The Ascent of Man  had been commissioned by the naturalist David  Attenborough, then controller of the British television channel BBC2.  A quarter of a century later Attenborough – who had by then become  the doyen of natural-history film-making – led another film crew to  Easter Island, to film another television series,  The State of the Planet .  He too chose those grim-faced statues as a backdrop, for his closing  scene. Alas, his message was almost exactly the opposite of Bronowski’s.  The philosophical difference between these two great broadcasters  – so alike in their infectious sense of wonder, their clarity of exposition,  and their humanity – was immediately evident in their different atti- tudes towards those statues. Attenborough called them ‘astonishing  stone sculptures . . . vivid evidence of the technological and artistic  skills of the people who once lived here’. Now, I wonder whether  Attenborough was really all that impressed by the islanders’ skills,  which had been exceeded millennia earlier in other Stone Age societies.  I expect he was being polite, for it is de rigueur in our culture to heap  praise upon any achievement of a primitive society. But Bronowski  refused to conform to that convention. He remarked, ‘People often ask  about Easter Island, How did men come here? They came here by  accident: that is not in question. The question is, Why could they not  get off?’ And why, he might have added, did others not follow to trade  with them (there was a great deal of trade among Polynesians other  than Easter Islanders), or to rob them, or to learn from them? Because  they did not know how.  As for the statues being ‘vivid evidence of . . . artistic skills’, Bronowski  420 the beginning of infinity was having none of that either. To him they were vivid evidence of  failure, not success: The critical question about these statues is,  Why were they all made  alike ? You see them  sitting there, like Diogenes in their barrels,  looking at the sky with empty eye-sockets, and  watching the sun and the stars go overhead  without ever trying to understand them. When  the Dutch discovered this island on Easter  Sunday in 1722, they said that it had the  makings of an earthly paradise. But it did not.  An earthly paradise is not made by this empty  repetition . . . These frozen faces, these frozen  frames in a film that is running down, mark a  civilization which failed to take the first step  on the ascent of rational knowledge. The Ascent of Man  (1973)  The statues were all made alike because Easter Island was a static  society. It never took that first step in the ascent of man – the beginning  of infinity.  Of the hundreds of statues on the island, built over the course of  several centuries, fewer than half are at their intended destinations.  The rest, including the largest, are in various stages of completion,  with as many as 10 per cent already in transit on specially built roads.  Again there are conflicting explanations, but, according to the prevailing  theory, it is because there was a large increase in the rate of statue- building just before it stopped for ever. In other words, as disaster  loomed, the islanders diverted ever more effort not into addressing the  problem – for they did not know how to do that – but into making  ever more and bigger (but very rarely better) monuments to their  ancestors. And what were those roads made of? Trees.  When Bronowski made his documentary, there were as yet no  detailed theories of how the Easter Island civilization fell. But, unlike  Attenborough, he was not interested in that, because his whole purpose  in going to Easter Island was to point out======================================================== unrealistically – that none  of the decision-makers in the group is able to persuade the others to  modify their preferences, or to create new preferences that are easier  to agree on. The realistic case is that neither the preferences nor the  options need be the same at the end of a decision-making process as  they were at the beginning. Why don’t they just . . . fix social-choice theory by including creative  processes such as explanation and persuasion in its mathematical model  of decision-making? Because it is not known how to model a creative  process. Such a model would  be  a creative process: an AI.  The conditions of ‘fairness’ as conceived in the various social-choice  problems are misconceptions analogous to empiricism: they are all  about the  input  to the decision-making process – who participates,  and how their opinions are integrated to form the ‘preference of the  group’. A rational analysis must concentrate instead on how the rules  and institutions contribute to the  removal  of bad policies and rulers,  and to the creation of new options. 346 the beginning of infinity Sometimes such an analysis does endorse one of the traditional  requirements, at least in part. For instance, it is indeed important that  no member of the group be privileged or deprived of representation.  But this is not so that all members can contribute to the answer. It is  because such discrimination entrenches in the system a preference  among their potential  criticisms . It does not make sense to  include   everyone’s favoured policies, or parts of them, in the new decision;  what is necessary for progress is to  exclude  ideas that fail to survive  criticism, and to prevent their entrenchment, and to promote the  creation of new ideas. Proportional representation is often defended on the grounds that  it leads to coalition governments and compromise policies. But com  - promises – amalgams of the policies of the contributors – have an  undeservedly high reputation. Though they are certainly better than  immediate violence, they are generally, as I have explained, bad policies.  If a policy is no one’s idea of what will work, then why should it work?  But that is not the worst of it. The key defect of compromise policies  is that when one of them is implemented and fails, no one learns  anything because no one ever agreed with it. Thus compromise policies  shield the underlying explanations which  do  at least seem good to some  faction from being criticized and abandoned. The system used to elect members of the legislatures of most countries  in the British political tradition is that each district (or ‘constituency’)  in the country is entitled to one seat in the legislature, and that seat goes  to the candidate with the largest number of votes in that district. This  is called the  plurality voting  system (‘plurality’ meaning ‘largest number  of votes’) – often called the ‘first-past-the-post’ system, because there is  no prize for any runner-up, and no second round of voting (both of  which feature in other electoral systems for the sake of increasing the  proportionality of the outcomes). Plurality voting typically ‘over- represents’ the two largest parties, compared with the proportion of  votes they receive. Moreover, it is not guaranteed to avoid the population  paradox, and is even capable of bringing one party to power when  another has received far more votes in total.  These features are often cited as arguments against plurality voting  and in favour of a more proportional system – either literal proportional  representation or other schemes such as transferable-vote systems and  347 Choices run-off systems which have the effect of making the representation of  voters in the legislature more proportional. However, under Popper’s  criterion, that is all insignificant in comparison with the greater    ef      fective    ness of plurality voting at removing bad governments and  policies. Let me trace the mechanism of that advantage more explicitly.  Following a plurality-voting election, the usual outcome is that the  party with the largest total number of votes has an overall majority in  the legislature, and therefore takes sole charge. All the losing parties  are removed entirely from power. This is rare under proportional  representation, because some of the parties in the old coalition are  usually needed in the new one. Consequently, the logic of plurality is  that politicians and political parties have little chance of gaining any  share in power unless they can persuade a substantial proportion of  the population to vote for them. That gives all parties the incentive to  find better explanations, or at least to convince more people of their  existing ones, for if they fail they will be relegated to powerlessness at  the next election.  In the plurality system, the winning explanations are then exposed to  criticism and testing, because they can be implemented without mixing  them with the======================================================== physical phenomena. Similarly, electrons and atoms are signifi- cant. Humans seem to have no place in that exalted company. Our  history and politics, our science, art and philosophy, our aspirations  and moral values – all these are tiny side effects of a supernova ex      - plosion a few billion years ago, which could be extinguished tomorrow  by another such explosion. Supernovae, too, are moderately significant  in the cosmic scheme of things. But it seems that one can explain  everything about supernovae, and almost everything else, without ever  mentioning people or knowledge at all. However, that is merely another parochial error, due to our current,  untypical, vantage point in an Enlightenment that is mere centuries  old. In the longer run, humans may colonize other solar systems and,  by increasing their knowledge, control ever more powerful physical  processes. If people ever choose to live near a star that is capable of  exploding, they may well wish to prevent such an explosion – probably  by removing some of the material from the star. Such a project would  use many orders of magnitude more energy than humans currently  control, and more advanced technology as well. But it is a fundament- ally simple task, not requiring any steps that are even close to limits  imposed by the laws of physics. So, with the right knowledge, it could  be achieved. Indeed, for all we know, engineers elsewhere in the universe  are already achieving it routinely. And consequently it is not true that  the attributes of supernovae in general are independent of the presence  or absence of people, or of what those people know and intend.  More generally, if we want to predict what a star will do, we first  have to guess whether there are any people near it, and, if so, what  knowledge they may have and what they may want to achieve. Outside  our parochial perspective, astrophysics is incomplete without a theory  of people, just as it is incomplete without a theory of gravity or nuclear  reactions. Note that this conclusion does not depend on the assumption  that humans, or anyone,  will  colonize the galaxy and take control of  71 The Spark any supernovae: the assumption that they will not is equally a theory  about the future behaviour of knowledge. Knowledge is a significant  phenomenon in the universe, because to make almost any prediction  about astrophysics one must  take a position  about what types of  knowledge will or will not be present near the phenomena in question.  So all explanations of what is out there in the physical world mention  knowledge and people, if only implicitly. But knowledge is more significant even than that. Consider any  physical object – for instance, a solar system, or a microscopic chip of  silicon – and then consider all the transformations that it is physically  possible for it to undergo. For instance, the silicon chip might be melted  and solidify in a different shape, or be transformed into a chip with  different functionality. The solar system might be devastated when its  star becomes a supernova, or life might evolve on one of its planets,  or it might be transformed, using transmutation and other futuristic  technologies, into microprocessors. In all cases, the class of transform- ations that could happen spontaneously – in the absence of knowledge  – is negligibly small compared with the class that could be effected  artificially by intelligent beings who wanted those transformations to  happen. So the explanations of  almost all physically possible phenomena   are about how knowledge would be applied to bring these phenomena  about. If you want to explain how an object might possibly reach a  temperature of ten degrees or a million, you can refer to spontaneous  processes and can avoid mentioning people explicitly (even though  most  processes at those temperatures can be brought about only by  people). But if you want to explain how an object might possibly cool  down to a millionth of a degree above absolute zero, you cannot avoid  explaining in detail what people would do. And that is still only the least of it. In your mind’s eye, continue your  journey from that point in intergalactic space to another, at least ten  times as far away. Our destination this time is inside one of the jets of  a quasar. What would it be like in one of those jets? Language is barely  capable of expressing it: it would be rather like facing a supernova  explosion at point-blank range, but for millions of years at a time. The  survival time for a human body would be measured in picoseconds.  As I said, it is unclear whether the laws of physics permit any knowledge  to grow there, let alone a life-support system for humans. It is about  72 the beginning of infinity as different from our ancestral environment as it could possibly be.  The laws of physics that explain it bear no resemblance to any rules  of thumb that were ever in our ancestors’ genes or in their culture. Yet  human brains today======================================================== position of the  moon in the sky does not repeat itself once a year, and because the  sun’s rays heating the Earth are integral to the explanation. Nor could  one easily incorporate any stories about how the sun god feels about  all this, because if the true explanation of winter is in the geometry of  the Earth–sun motion, then how anyone feels about it is irrelevant,  and if there were some flaw in that explanation, then no story about  how anyone felt would put it right.  The axis-tilt theory also predicts that the seasons will be out of phase  in the two hemispheres. So if they had been found to be in phase, the  25 The Reach of Explanations theory would have been refuted, just as, in the event, the Persephone  and Freyr myths were refuted by the opposite observation. But the  difference is, if the axis-tilt theory had been refuted, its defenders would  have had nowhere to go. No easily implemented change could make  tilted axes cause the same seasons all over the planet. Fundamentally  new ideas would have been needed. That is what makes good ex    - planations essential to science: it is only when a theory is a good  explanation – hard to vary – that it even matters whether it is testable.  Bad explanations are equally useless whether they are testable or not.  Most accounts of the differences between myth and science make  too much of the issue of testability – as if the ancient Greeks’ great  mistake was that they did not send expeditions to the southern hemi- sphere to observe the seasons. But in fact they could never have guessed  that such an expedition might provide evidence about seasons unless  they had already guessed that seasons would be out of phase in the  two hemispheres – and if that guess was hard to vary, which it could  have been only if it had been part of a good explanation. If their guess  was  easy  to vary, they might just as well have saved themselves the  boat fare, stayed at home, and tested the easily testable theory that  winter can be staved off by yodelling.  So long as they had no better explanation than the Persephone myth,  there should have been no need for testing. Had they been seeking good  explanations, they would immediately have tried to improve upon the  myth, without testing it. That is what we do today. We do not test every  testable theory, but only the few that we find are good explanations.  Science would be impossible if it were not for the fact that the over- whelming majority of false theories can be rejected out of hand without  any experiment, simply for being bad explanations. Good explanations are often strikingly simple or elegant – as I shall  discuss in Chapter 14. Also, a common way in which an explanation  can be bad is by containing superfluous features or arbitrariness, and  sometimes removing those yields a good explanation. This has given  rise to a misconception known as ‘Occam’s razor’ (named after the  fourteenth-century philosopher William of Occam, but dating back  to antiquity), namely that one should always seek the ‘simplest ex    - planation’. One statement of it is ‘Do not multiply assumptions beyond  necessity.’ However, there are plenty of very simple explanations that  26 the beginning of infinity are nevertheless easily variable (such as ‘Demeter did it’). And, while  assumptions ‘beyond necessity’ make a theory bad by definition, there  have been many mistaken ideas of what is ‘necessary’ in a theory.  Instrumentalism, for instance, considers explanation itself unnecessary,  and so do many other bad philosophies of science, as I shall discuss  in Chapter 12. When a formerly good explanation has been falsified by new  observations, it is no longer a good explanation, because the problem  has expanded to include those observations. Thus the standard  scientific methodology of dropping theories when refuted by experi- ment is implied by the requirement for good explanations. The best  explanations are the ones that are most constrained by existing know- ledge – including other good explanations as well as other knowledge  of the phenomena to be explained. That is why testable explanations  that have passed stringent tests become extremely good explanations,  which is in turn why the maxim of testability promotes the growth  of knowledge in science. Conjectures are the products of creative imagination. But the problem  with imagination is that it can create fiction much more easily than  truth. As I have suggested, historically, virtually all human attempts to  explain experience in terms of a wider reality have indeed been fiction,  in the form of myths, dogma and mistaken common sense – and the  rule of testability is an insufficient check on such mistakes. But the  quest for good explanations does the job: inventing falsehoods is easy,  and therefore they are easy to vary once found; discovering good  explanations is hard, but the harder they are to find, the harder they  are to vary once found. The ideal that explanatory======================================================== the laws of epistem  ology  dictate that no such memes are possible without creativity. 416 the beginning of infinity Not only is creativity necessary for human meme replication, it is  also sufficient. Deaf people and blind people and paralysed people are  still able to acquire and create human ideas to a more or less full extent.  Hence, neither upright walking nor fine motor control nor the ability  to parse sounds into words nor any of those other adaptations, though  they might have played a role historically in creating the conditions  for human evolution, were functionally necessary to allow humans to  become creative. Nor, therefore, are they philosophically significant    in understanding what humans are today, namely  people : creative,  universal explainers. It was specifically creativity that made the difference between ape  memes – expensive in terms of the time and effort required to replicate  them, and inherently limited in the knowledge that they were capable  of expressing – and human memes, which are efficiently transmitted  and universal in their expressive power. The beginning of creativity  was, in that sense, the beginning of infinity. We have no way of telling,  at present, how likely it was for creativity to begin to evolve in apes.  But, once it began to, there would automatically have been evolutionary  pressure for it to continue, and for other meme-facilitating adaptations  to follow in its wake. This increase must have continued through all  the static societies of prehistory. The horror of static societies, which I described in the previous  chapter, can now be seen as a hideous practical joke that the universe  played on the human species. Our creativity, which evolved in order  to increase the amount of knowledge that we could use, and which  would immediately have been capable of producing an endless stream  of useful innovations as well, was from the outset prevented from doing  so by the very knowledge – the memes – that that creativity preserved.  The strivings of individuals to better themselves were, from the outset,  perverted by a superhumanly evil mechanism that turned their efforts  to exactly the opposite end: to thwart all attempts at improvement; to  keep sentient beings locked in a crude, suffering state for eternity. Only  the Enlightenment, hundreds of thousands of years later, and after who  knows how many false starts, may at last have made it practical to  escape from that eternity into infinity. 417 The Evolution of Creativity terminology Imitation  Copying behaviour. This is different from human meme  replication, which copies the knowledge that is causing the behaviour. meanings of ‘the beginning of infinity’  encountered in this chapter – The evolution of creativity. –  The reassignment of creativity from its original function of preserving  memes faithfully, to the function of creating new knowledge. summary On the face of it, creativity cannot have been useful during the evolution  of humans, because knowledge was growing much too slowly for the  more creative individuals to have had any selective advantage. This is  a puzzle. A second puzzle is: how can complex memes even exist, given  that brains have no mechanism to download them from other brains?  Complex memes do not mandate specific bodily actions, but  rules.  We  can see the actions, but not the rules, so how do we replicate them?  We replicate them by creativity. That solves both problems, for  replicating memes unchanged is the function for which creativity  evolved. And that is why our species exists. 418 17 Unsustainable Easter Island in the South Pacific is famous mainly – let’s face it,  only   – for the large stone statues that were built there many centuries ago  by the islanders. The purpose of the statues is unknown, but is thought  to be connected with an ancestor-worshipping religion. The first settlers  may have arrived on the island as early as the fifth century ce. They  developed a complex Stone Age civilization, which suddenly collapsed  over a millennium later. By some accounts there was starvation, war  and perhaps cannibalism. The population fell to a small fraction of  what it had been, and their culture was lost. The prevailing theory is that the Easter Islanders brought disaster  upon themselves, in part by chopping down the forest which had  originally covered most of the island. They eliminated the most useful  species of tree altogether. This is not a wise thing to do if you rely on  timber for shelter, or if fish form a large part of your diet and your  boats and nets are made of wood. And there were knock-on effects  such as soil erosion, precipitating the destruction of the environment  on which the islanders had depended. Some archaeologists dispute this theory. For example, Terry Hunt  has concluded that the islanders arrived only in the thirteenth century,  and that their civilization continued to function throughout the defores- tation (which he attributes to======================================================== position of the  moon in the sky does not repeat itself once a year, and because the  sun’s rays heating the Earth are integral to the explanation.

The ideal that explanatory======================================================== meme generation. (Meme ‘generations’ are  simply successive instances of copying to another individual.) Tech- nology can add further stages to a meme’s life cycle. For instance, the  behaviour may be to write something down – thus embodying the  meme in a third physical form, which may later cause a person who  reads it to enact other behaviour, which then causes the meme to    appear in someone’s brain. But all memes must have at least two  physical forms. In contrast, for genes the replicator exists in only one physical form  – the DNA strand (of a germ cell). Even though it may be copied to  other locations in the organism, translated into RNA, and expressed  as behaviour, none of those forms is a replicator. The idea that the  behaviour might be a replicator is a form of Lamarckism, since it  implies that behaviours that had been modified by circumstances would  be inherited.  377 The Evolution of Culture A gene exists in only one physical form, which is copied. Because of the alternating physical forms of a meme, it has to survive  two different, and potentially unrelated, mechanisms of selection in  every generation. The brain-memory form has to cause the holder to  enact the behaviour; and the behaviour form has to cause the new  recipient to remember it – and to enact it. So, for example, although religions prescribe behaviours such as  educating one’s children to adopt the religion, the mere intention to  transmit a meme to one’s children or anyone else is quite insufficient  to make that happen. That is why the overwhelming majority of  attempts to start a new religion fail, even if the founder members try  hard to propagate it. In such cases, what has happened is that an idea  that people have adopted has succeeded in causing them to enact  various behaviours including ones intended to cause their children and  others to do the same – but the behaviour has failed to cause the same  idea to be stored in the minds of those recipients.  The existence of long-lived religions is sometimes explained from  the premise that ‘children are gullible’, or that they are ‘easily frightened’  by tales of the supernatural. But that is not the explanation. The  overwhelming majority of ideas simply do not have what it takes to  persuade (or frighten or cajole or otherwise cause) children or anyone  else into doing the same to other people. If establishing a faithfully  replicating meme were that easy, the whole adult population in our  society would be proficient at algebra, thanks to the efforts made to  378 the beginning of infinity teach it to them when they were children. To be exact, they would all  be proficient algebra  teachers . To be a meme, an idea has to contain quite sophisticated knowledge  of how to cause humans to do at least two independent things: assimi- late the meme faithfully, and enact it. That some memes can replicate  themselves with great fidelity for many generations is a token of how  much knowledge they contain.  The selfish meme If a gene is in a genome at all, then, when suitable circumstances arise,  it will definitely be expressed as an enzyme, as I described in Chapter  6, and will then cause its characteristic effects. Nor can it be left behind  if the rest of its genome is successfully replicated. But merely being  present in a mind does not automatically get a meme expressed as  behaviour: the meme has to compete for that privilege with other ideas  – memes and non-memes, about all sorts of subjects – in the same mind.  And merely being expressed as behaviour does not automatically get  the meme copied into a recipient along with other memes: it has to  compete for the recipients’ attention and acceptance with all sorts of  behaviours by other people, and with the recipient’s own ideas. All that  is in addition to the analogue of the type of selection that genes face,  each meme competing with rival versions of itself across the population,  perhaps by containing the knowledge for some useful function. Memes are subject to all sorts of random and intentional variation  in addition to all that selection, and so they evolve. So to this extent  the same logic holds as for genes: memes are ‘selfish’. They do not  necessarily evolve to benefit their holders, or their society – or, again,  even themselves, except in the sense of replicating better than other  memes. (Though now  most  other memes are their rivals, not just  variants of themselves.) The successful meme variant is the one that  changes the behaviour of its holders in such a way as to make itself  best at displacing other memes from the population. This variant may  well benefit its holders, or their culture, or the species as a whole. But  if it harms them, or destroys them, it will spread anyway. Memes that  harm society are a familiar phenomenon. You need only consider the  harm done by adherents of political views, or religions, that you  379 The Evolution of Culture especially abhor. Societies have been destroyed======================================================== Attenborough regards the culture as  having been very valuable and its fall as a tragedy. Bronowski’s view was  closer to mine, which is that since the culture never improved, its  survival  for many centuries was a tragedy, like that of all static societies. Attenborough is not alone in drawing frightening lessons from the  history of Easter Island. It has become a widely adduced version of    the Spaceship Earth metaphor. But what exactly is the analogy behind  the lesson? The idea that civilization depends on good  forest  manage- ment has little reach. But the broader interpretation, that survival  depends on good  resource  management, has almost no content:  any   physical object can be deemed a ‘resource’. And, since problems are  soluble, all disasters are caused by ‘poor resource management’. The  ancient Roman ruler Julius Caesar was stabbed to death, so one could  sum    marize his mistake as ‘imprudent iron management, resulting in  an excessive build-up of iron in his body’. It is true that if he had  succeeded in keeping iron away from his body he would not have died  in the (exact) way he did, yet, as an explanation of how and why he  died, that ludicrously misses the point. The interesting question is not  what he was stabbed with, but how it came about that other politicians  plotted to remove him violently from office and that they succeeded.  A Popperian analysis would focus on the fact that Caesar had taken  vigorous steps to ensure that he could not be removed  without  violence.  And then on the fact that his removal did not rectify, but actually  entrenched, this progress-suppressing innovation. To under  stand such  events and their wider significance, one has to understand the politics  of the situation, the psychology, the philosophy, sometimes the theology.  Not the cutlery. The Easter Islanders may or may not have suffered a  forest-management fiasco. But, if they did, the ex      planation would not  be about why they made mistakes – problems are inevitable – but why  they failed to correct them. I have argued that the laws of nature cannot possibly impose any  bound on progress: by the argument of Chapters 1 and 3, denying this  is tantamount to invoking the supernatural. In other words, progress  is  sustainable , indefinitely. But only by people who engage in a particular  kind of thinking and behaviour – the problem-solving and problem- creating kind characteristic of the Enlightenment. And that requires  the optimism of a dynamic society. 424 the beginning of infinity One of the consequences of optimism is that one expects to learn  from failure – one’s own and others’. But the idea that our civilization  has something to learn from the Easter Islanders’ alleged forestry failure  is not derived from any structural resemblance between our situation  and theirs. For they failed to make progress in practically every area.  No one expects the Easter Islanders’ failures in, say, medicine to explain  our difficulties in curing cancer, or their failure to understand the night  sky to explain why a quantum theory of gravity is elusive to us. The  Easter Islanders’ errors, both methodological and substantive, were  simply too elementary to be relevant to us, and their imprudent forestry,  if that is really what destroyed their civilization, would merely be typical  of their lack of problem-solving ability across the board. We should  do much better to study their many small successes than their entirely  commonplace failures. If we could discover their rules of thumb (such  as ‘stone mulching’ to help grow crops on poor soil), we might find  valuable fragments of historical and ethnological knowledge, or    perhaps even something of practical use. But one cannot draw general  conclusions from rules of thumb. It would be astonishing if the details  of a primitive, static society’s collapse had any relevance to hidden  dangers that may be facing our open, dynamic and scientific society,  let alone what we should do about them.  The knowledge that would have saved the Easter Islanders’ civil- ization has already been in our possession for centuries. A sextant would  have allowed them to explore their ocean and bring back the seeds of  new forests and of new ideas. Greater wealth, and a written culture,  would have enabled them to recover after a devastating plague. But,  most of all, they would have been better at solving problems of all kinds  if they had known some of our ideas about how to do that, such as the  rudi  ments of a scientific outlook. Such knowledge would not have  guaranteed their welfare, any more than it guarantees ours. Nevertheless,  the fact that their civilization failed for lack of what ours discovered  long ago cannot be an ominous ‘warning of what the future could hold’  for us. This knowledge-based approach to explaining human events follows  from the general arguments of this book. We know that achieving  arbitrary physical transformations that are not======================================================== of unseen people, considers our own  thoughts and intentions to be aggregates of unseen (though not un    - seeable) microscopic physical processes in our brains.  So fruitful has this abandonment of anthropocentric theories been,  and so important in the broader history of ideas, that  anti -anthro- pocentrism has increasingly been elevated to the status of a universal  principle, sometimes called the ‘Principle of Mediocrity’:  there is  44 the beginning of infinity nothing significant about humans (in the cosmic scheme of things) . As  the physicist Stephen Hawking put it, humans are ‘just a chemical scum  on the surface of a typical planet that’s in orbit round a typical star  on the outskirts of a typical galaxy’. The proviso ‘in the cosmic scheme  of things’ is necessary because the chemical scum evidently does have  a special significance according to values that it applies to itself, such  as moral values. But the Principle says that all such values are them- selves anthropocentric: they explain only the behaviour of the scum,  which is itself insignificant. It is easy to mistake quirks of one’s own, familiar environment or  perspective (such as the rotation of the night sky) for objective features  of what one is observing, or to mistake rules of thumb (such as the  prediction of daily sunrises) for universal laws. I shall refer to that sort  of error as  parochialism .  Anthropocentric errors are examples of parochialism, but not all  parochialism is anthropocentric. For instance, the prediction that the  seasons are in phase all over the world is a parochial error but not an  anthropocentric one: it does not involve explaining seasons in terms  of people.  Another influential idea about the human condition is sometimes  given the dramatic name  Spaceship Earth . Imagine a ‘generation ship’  – a spaceship on a journey so long that many generations of passengers  live out their lives in transit. This has been proposed as a means    of colonizing other star systems. In the Spaceship Earth idea, that  generation ship is a metaphor for the  biosphere  – the system of all  living things on Earth and the regions they inhabit. Its passengers  represent all humans on Earth. Outside the spaceship, the universe is  implacably hostile, but the interior is a vastly complex life-support  system, capable of providing everything that the passengers need    to thrive. Like the spaceship, the biosphere recycles all waste and,    using its capacious nuclear power plant (the sun), it is completely    self-sufficient. Just as the spaceship’s life-support system is designed to sustain its  passengers, so the biosphere has the ‘appearance of design’: it seems  highly adapted to sustaining us (claims the metaphor) because  we  were  adapted to  it  by evolution. But its capacity is finite: if we overload it,  either by our sheer numbers or by adopting lifestyles too different from  45 The Spark those that we evolved to live (the ones that it is ‘designed’ to support),  it will break down. And, like the passengers on that spaceship, we get  no second chances: if our lifestyle becomes too careless or profligate  and we ruin our life-support system, we have nowhere else to go. The Spaceship Earth metaphor and the Principle of Mediocrity have  both gained wide acceptance among scientifically minded people – to  the extent of becoming truisms. This is despite the fact that, on the  face of it, they argue in somewhat opposite directions: the Principle  of Mediocrity stresses how  typical  the Earth and its chemical scum  are (in the sense of being unremarkable), while Spaceship Earth stresses  how  untypical  they are (in the sense of being uniquely suited to each  other). But when the two ideas are interpreted in broad, philosophical  ways, as they usually are, they can easily converge. Both see themselves  as correcting much the same parochial misconceptions, namely that  our experience of life on Earth is representative of the universe, and  that the Earth is vast, fixed and permanent. They both stress instead  that it is tiny and ephemeral. Both oppose arrogance: the Principle of  Mediocrity opposes the pre-Enlightenment arrogance of believing  ourselves significant in the world; the Spaceship Earth metaphor  opposes the Enlightenment arrogance of aspiring to control the world.  Both have a moral element: we  should not  consider ourselves signifi- cant, they assert; we  should not  expect the world to submit indefinitely  to our depredations.  Thus the two ideas generate a rich conceptual framework that can  inform an entire world view. Yet, as I shall explain, they are both false,  even in the straightforward factual sense. And in the broader sense  they are so misleading that, if you were seeking maxims worth being  carved in stone and recited each morning before breakfast, you could  do a lot worse than to use their  negations . That is to say, the truth is  that People  are  significant in the cosmic scheme of======================================================== to rooms, and so the original assump- tion that all the cards had been so assigned has led to a contradiction. An infinity that  is  small enough to be placed in one-to-one cor  - respondence with the natural numbers is called a ‘ countable  infinity’  – rather an unfortunate term, because no one can count up to infinity.  But it has the connotation that every  element  of a countably infinite  set could in principle be reached by counting those elements in some  suitable order. Larger infinities are called  uncountable . So, there is an  uncountable infinity of real numbers between any two distinct limits.  Which room 1 2 3 4 0. 6 77976… 0.6 9 4698… 0.39 9 221… 0.236 6 46… Which card … … 172 the beginning of infinity Furthermore, there are uncountably many  orders  of infinity, each too  large to be put into one-to-one correspondence with the lower ones. Another important uncountable set is the set of  all logically possible  reassignments  of guests to rooms in Infinity Hotel (or, as the mathem- aticians put it, all possible  permutations  of the natural numbers). You  can easily prove that if you imagine any one reassignment specified in  an infinitely long table, like this: Specifying one reassignment of guests Then imagine all possible reassignments listed one below the other,  thus ‘counting’ them. The diagonal argument applied to this list will  prove that the list is impossible, and hence that the set of all possible  reassignments is uncountable.  Since the management of Infinity Hotel have to specify a reassignment  in the form of a public-address announcement, the specification must  consist of a finite sequence of words – and hence a finite sequence of  characters from some alphabet. The set of such sequences is countable  and therefore infinitely smaller than the set of possible reassignments .  That means that only an infinitesimal proportion of all logically  possible reassignments can be specified. This is a remarkable limitation  on the apparently limitless power of Infinity Hotel’s management to  shuffle the guests around.  Almost all  ways in which the guests could,  as a matter of logic, be distributed among the rooms are unattainable. Infinity Hotel has a unique, self-sufficient waste-disposal system.  Every day, the management first rearrange the guests in a way that  ensures that all rooms are occupied. Then they make the following  announcement. ‘Within the next minute, will all guests please bag their  trash and give it to the guest in the next higher-numbered room. Should  you  receive  a bag during that minute, then pass it on within the  Guest in room number Moves to 1    2     3    4   … 38  173  80  30  … 173 A Window on Infinity following half minute. Should you receive a bag during that half minute,  pass it on within the following quarter minute, and so on.’ To comply,  the guests have to work fast – but none of them has to work  infinitely  fast, or handle infinitely many bags. Each of them performs a finite  number of actions, as per the hotel rules. After two minutes, all these  trash-moving actions have ceased. So, two minutes after they begin,  none of the guests has any trash left.  Infinity Hotel’s waste-disposal system All the trash in the hotel has disappeared from the universe. It is  nowhere . No one has  put  it ‘nowhere’: every guest has merely moved  some of it into another room. The ‘nowhere’ where all that trash has  gone is called, in physics, a  singularity . Singularities may well happen  in reality, inside black holes and elsewhere. But I digress: at the moment,  we are still discussing mathematics, not physics.  Of course, Infinity Hotel has infinitely many staff. Several of them  are assigned to look after each guest. But the staff themselves are treated  as guests in the hotel, staying in numbered rooms and receiving exactly  the same benefits as every other guest: each of them has several other  staff assigned to their welfare. However, they are not allowed to ask  those staff to do their work for them. That is because, if they all did  this, the hotel would grind to a halt. Infinity is not magic. It has logical  rules: that is the whole point of the Infinity Hotel thought experiment. The fallacious idea of delegating all one’s work to other staff in  174 the beginning of infinity higher-numbered rooms is called an  infinite regress.  It is one of the  things that one cannot validly do with infinity. There is an old joke  about the heckler who interrupts an astrophysics lecture to insist that  the Earth is flat and supported on the back of elephants standing on  a giant turtle. ‘What supports the turtle?’ asks the lecturer. ‘Another  turtle.’ ‘What supports  that  turtle?’ ‘You can’t fool me,’ replies the  heckler triumphantly: ‘it’s turtles from there on down.’ That theory is  a bad explanation not because it fails to explain  everything  (no theory  does), but because what it leaves unexplained is effectively the same  as what it purports to explain======================================================== evidence’ (evidence about unwitnessed events) is ‘a very tricky thing  . . . It may seem to point very straight to one thing, but if you shift  your own point of view a little, you may find it pointing in an equally  uncompromising manner to something entirely different . . . There is  nothing more deceptive than an obvious fact.’ The same holds for  scientific discovery. And that again raises the question: how do we  know? If all our theories originate locally, as guesswork in our own  minds, and can be tested only locally, by experience, how is it that they  contain such extensive and accurate knowledge about the reality that  we have never experienced?  *The term was coined by the philosopher Norwood Russell Hanson. 11 The Reach of Explanations I am not asking what authority scientific knowledge is derived from,  or rests on. I mean, literally, by what process do ever truer and more  detailed explanations about the world come to be represented physically  in our brains? How do we come to know about the interactions of  subatomic particles during transmutation at the centre of a distant star,  when even the tiny trickle of light that reaches our instruments from  the star was emitted by glowing gas at the star’s surface, a million  kilometres above where the transmutation is happening? Or about  conditions in the fireball during the first few seconds after the Big Bang,  which would instantly have destroyed any sentient being or scientific  instrument? Or about the future, which we have no way of measuring  at all? How is it that we can predict, with some non-negligible degree  of confidence, whether a new design of microchip will work, or whether  a new drug will cure a particular disease, even though they have never  existed before? For most of human history, we did not know how to do any of this.  People were not designing microchips or medications or even the wheel.  For thousands of generations, our ancestors looked up at the night sky  and wondered what stars are – what they are made of, what makes  them shine, what their relationship is with each other and with us –  which was exactly the right thing to wonder about. And they were  using eyes and brains anatomically indistinguishable from those of  modern astronomers. But they discovered nothing about it. Much the  same was true in every other field of knowledge. It was not for lack of  trying, nor for lack of thinking. People observed the world. They    tried to understand it – but almost entirely in vain. Occasionally they  recognized simple patterns in the appearances. But when they tried to  find out what was really there behind those appearances, they failed  almost completely.  I expect that, like today, most people wondered about such things  only occasionally – during breaks from addressing their more parochial  concerns. But their parochial concerns  also  involved yearning to  know – and not only out of pure curiosity. They wished they knew  how to safeguard their food supply; how they could rest when tired  without risking starvation; how they could be warmer, cooler, safer, in  less pain – in every aspect of their lives, they wished they knew how  to make progress. But, on the timescale of individual lifetimes, they  12 the beginning of infinity almost never made any. Discoveries such as fire, clothing, stone    tools, bronze, and so on, happened so rarely that from an individual’s  point of view the world never improved. Sometimes people even  realized (with somewhat miraculous prescience) that making progress  in practical ways would  depend  on progress in understanding puzzling  phenomena in the sky. They even conjectured links between the two,  such as myths, which they found compelling enough to dominate their  lives – yet which still bore no resemblance to the truth. In short, they  wanted to create knowledge, in order to make progress, but they did  not know how.  This was the situation from our species’ earliest prehistory, through  the dawn of civilization, and through its imperceptibly slow increase  in sophistication – with many reverses – until a few centuries ago. Then  a powerful new mode of discovery and explanation emerged, which  later became known as  science . Its emergence is known as the  scientific  revolution , because it succeeded almost immediately in creating know- ledge at a noticeable rate, which has increased ever since.  What had changed? What made science effective at understanding  the physical world when all previous ways had failed? What were  people now doing, for the first time, that made the difference? This  question began to be asked as soon as science began to be successful,  and there have been many conflicting answers, some containing truth.  But none, in my view, has reached the heart of the matter. To explain  my own answer, I have to give a little context first. The scientific revolution was part of a wider intellectual revolution,  the  Enlightenment , which also brought progress in other======================================================== could. One would impress  one’s chief, priest, parent or potential mate by replicating, and follow-  ing, their standards of what one should strive for. One would impress  414 the beginning of infinity the tribe as a whole by replicating their idea (or the ideas of the most  influential among them) of what was worthy, and acting accordingly.  Hence, paradoxically, it requires creativity to thrive in a static society  – creativity that enables one to be  less  innovative than other people.  And that is how primitive, static societies, which contained pitifully  little knowledge and existed only by suppressing innovation, con-  stituted environments that strongly favoured the evolution of an ever- greater ability to innovate. From the perspective of those hypothetical extraterrestrials observing  our ancestors, a community of advanced apes with memes before the  evolution of creativity began would have looked superficially similar  to their descendants after the jump to universality. The latter would  merely have had many more memes. But the mechanism keeping those  memes replicating faithfully would have changed profoundly. The  animals of the earlier community would have been relying on their  lack of creativity to replicate their memes; the people, despite living in  a static society, would be relying entirely on their creativity.  As with all jumps to universality, the way in which the jump emerged  out of gradual changes is interesting to think about. Creativity is a  property of  software . As I said, we could be running AI programs on  our laptop computers today if we knew how to write (or evolve) such  programs. Like all software, it would require the computer to have  certain hardware specifications in order to be able to process the  required amount of data in the required time. It so happened that the  hardware specifications that would make creativity practicable were  included in those that were being heavily favoured for pre-creative  meme replication. The principal one would have been memory capacity:  the more one could remember, the more memes one could enact, and  the more accurately one could enact them. But there may also have  been hardware abilities such as mirror neurons for imitating a wider  range of elementary actions than apes could ape – for instance, the  elementary sounds of a language. It would have been natural for such  hardware assistance for language abilities to be evolving at the same  time as the increased meme bandwidth. So, by the time creativity was  evolving, there would already have been significant co-evolution  between genes and memes: genes evolving hardware to support more  and better memes, and memes evolving to take over ever more of what  415 The Evolution of Creativity had previously been genetic functions such as choice of mate, and  methods of eating, fighting and so on. Therefore, my speculation is  that the creativity program is not entirely inborn. It is a combination  of genes and memes. The hardware of the human brain would have  been  capable  of being creative (and sentient, conscious and all those  other things) long before any creative program existed. Considering a  sequence of brains during this period, the earliest ones  capable  of  supporting creativity would have required very ingenious programming  to fit the capacity into the barely suitable hardware. As the hardware  improved, creativity could have been programmed more easily, until  the moment when it became easy enough actually to be done by  evolution. We do not know  what  was being gradually increased in that  approach to a universal explainer. If we did, we could program one  tomorrow. The future of creativity Before Blackmore and others realized the significance of memes in  human evolution, all sorts of root causes had been suggested for what  propelled a normal-looking lineage of apes into rapidly becoming a  species that can explain and control the universe. Some proposed that  it was the adaptation of walking upright, which freed the front limbs,  with their opposable thumbs, to specialize in manipulation. Some  proposed that climate change favoured adaptations that would make  our ancestors more able to exploit diverse habitats. And, as I have  mentioned, sexual selection is always a candidate for explaining rapid  evolution. Then there is the ‘Machiavellian hypothesis’ that human  intelligence evolved in order to predict the behaviour of others, and to  fool them. There is also the hypothesis that human intelligence is an  enhanced version of the apes’ aping adaptation – which, as I have  argued, could not be true. Nevertheless, Blackmore’s ‘meme machine’  idea, that human brains evolved in order to replicate memes, must be  true. The reason it must be true is that,  whatever  had set off the  evolution of any of those attributes, creativity would have had to evolve  as well. For no human-level mental achievements would be possible  without human-type (explanatory) memes, and======================================================== conclusion from the premises, and every correctly exe  - cuted computation is a proof that the output is the outcome of the  given operations on the input. Now, a computation can also be thought of as computing a  function   that takes an arbitrary natural number as its input and delivers an  output that depends in a particular way on that input. So, for instance,  doubling a number is a function. Infinity Hotel typically tells guests  to change rooms by specifying a function and telling them all to  compute it with different inputs (their room numbers). One of    Turing’s conclusions was that almost all mathematical functions    that exist logically cannot be computed by any program. They are  ‘non-computable’ for the same reason that most logically possible  reallocations of rooms in Infinity Hotel cannot be effected by any  instruction by the management: the set of all functions is uncountably  infinite, while the set of all programs is merely countably infinite.  (That is why it is meaningful to say that ‘almost all’ members of the  infinite set of all functions have a particular property.) Hence also – as  the mathematician Kurt Gödel had discovered using a different  approach to Hilbert’s challenge – almost all mathematical  truths  have  no  proofs . They are unprovable truths. It also follows that almost all mathematical statements are  undecid- 185 A Window on Infinity able : there is no proof that they are true, and no proof that they are  false .  Each of them  is  either true or false, but there is no way of using  physical objects such as brains or computers to discover which is which.  The laws of physics provide us with only a narrow window through  which we can look out on the world of abstractions. All undecidable statements are, directly or indirectly, about infinite  sets. To the opponents of infinity in mathematics, this is due to the  meaninglessness of such statements. But to me it is a powerful argument  – like Hofstadter’s 641 argument – that abstractions exist objectively.  For it means that the truth value of an undecidable statement is certainly  not just a convenient way of describing the behaviour of some physical  object like a computer or a collection of dominoes. Interestingly, very few questions are  known  to be undecidable, even  though most are – and I shall return to that point. But there are many  unsolved mathematical conjectures, and some of those may well be  undecidable. Take, for instance, the ‘prime-pairs conjecture’. A prime  pair is a pair of prime numbers that differ by 2 – such as 5 and 7. The  conjecture is that there is no largest prime pair: there are infinitely  many of them. Suppose for the sake of argument that that is undecidable  – using  our  physics. Under many other laws of physics it is decidable.  The laws of Infinity Hotel are an example. Again, the details of how  the management would settle the prime-pairs issue are not essential to  my argument, but I present them here for the benefit of mathematically  minded readers. The management would announce: First: Please check within the next minute whether your room number  and the number two above it are both primes. Next: If they are, then send a message back through lower-numbered  rooms saying that you have found a prime pair. Use the usual method  for sending rapid messages (allow one minute for the first step and  thereafter each step must be completed in half the time of the previous  one). Store a record of this message in the lowest-numbered room that  is not already storing a record of a previous such message. Next: Check with the room numbered one more than yours. If that  guest is not storing such a record and you are, then send a message to  room 1 saying that there is a largest prime pair. 186 the beginning of infinity At the end of five minutes, the management would know the truth of  the prime-pairs conjecture. So, there is nothing  mathematically  special about the undecidable  questions, the non-computable functions, the unprovable propositions.  They are distinguished by physics only. Different physical laws would  make different things infinite, different things computable, different  truths – both mathematical and scientific – knowable. It is only the  laws of physics that determine which abstract entities and relationships  are modelled by physical objects such as mathematicians’ brains,  computers and sheets of paper. Some mathematicians wondered, at the time of Hilbert’s challenge,  whether finiteness was really an essential feature of a proof. (They  meant mathematically essential.) After all, infinity makes sense math- ematically, so why not infinite proofs? Hilbert, though he was a great  defender of Cantor’s theory, ridiculed the idea. Both he and his critics  were thereby making the same mistake as Zeno: they were all assuming  that some class of abstract entities can  prove  things, and that math- ematical reasoning could determine what that class is.

A tiny minority of  the histories have been significantly affected by very ‘unlikely’ events,  but even in those the information  flow  – what affects what – is still very  tame and familiar. For instance, a version of the ship’s log that contains  records of bizarre coincidences will be perceptible to people who  remember those coincidences, but not to other instances of those people.  Thus the information in the fictional multiverse flows along a  branching tree, whose branches – histories – have different thicknesses  (measures) and never rejoin once they have separated. Each behaves  exactly as if the others did not exist. If that were the whole story, that  multiverse’s imaginary laws of physics would still be fatally flawed as  explanations in the same way that they have been all along: there would  be no difference between their predictions and those of much more  straightforward laws saying that there is only one universe – one history  – in which the transporter  randomly  introduces a change in the objects  that it teleports. Under those laws, instead of branching into two  autonomous histories on such occasions, the single history randomly  does or does not undergo such a change. Thus the entire stupendously  complicated multiverse that we have imagined – with its multiplicity  of entities including people walking through each other and its bizarre  occurrences and its entanglement information – would collapse into  nothing, like the galaxy in Chapter 2 that became an emulsion flaw.  The multiverse explanation of the same events would be a bad  *That this information is carried entirely locally in objects is currently somewhat  controversial. For a detailed technical discussion see the paper ‘Information Flow in  Entangled Quantum Systems’ by myself and Patrick Hayden ( Proceedings of the Royal  Society  A456 (2000)). 282 the beginning of infinity explanation, and so the world would be inexplicable to the inhabitants  if it were true. It may seem that, by imposing all those conditions on information  flow, we have gone to a lot of trouble to achieve that very attribute – to  hide, from the inhabitants, the Byzantine intricacies of their world. In  the words of Lewis Carroll’s White Knight in  Through the Looking  Glass , it is as if we were . . . thinking of a plan   To dye one’s whiskers green, And always use so large a fan   That they could not be seen. Now it is time to start removing the fan. In quantum physics, information flow in the multiverse is not as  tame as in that branching tree of histories I have described. That is  because of one further quantum phenomenon: under certain circum- stances, the laws of motion allow histories to rejoin (becoming fungible  again). This is the time-reverse of the splitting (differentiation of history  into two or more histories) that I have already described, so a natural  way to implement it in our fictional multiverse is for the transporter  to be capable of undoing its own history-splitting. If we represent the original splitting like this where  X  is the normal voltage and  Y  is the anomalous one introduced  by the transporter, then the rejoining of histories can be represented as In an interference phenomenon, differentiated histories rejoin. X X Y ය interference X Y X ය 283 The Multiverse This phenomenon is known as  interference : the presence of the  Y- history  interferes  with what the transporter usually does to an  X -history.  Instead, the  X  and  Y  histories merge. This is  rather like  the doppelgängers  merging with their originals in some phantom-zone stories, except that  here we do not need to repeal the principle of the conservation of mass  or any other conservation law: the total measure of all the histories  remains constant.  Interference is the phenomenon that can provide the inhabitants of  the multiverse with evidence of the existence of multiple histories in  their world without allowing the histories to communicate. For example,  suppose that they run the transporter twice in quick succession (I shall  explain in a moment what ‘quick’ means):  An interference experiment If they did this repeatedly (with, say, different copies of the transporter  on each occasion), they could soon infer that the intermediate result  could not  be just randomly  X  or  Y , because if it were then the final  outcome would sometimes be  Y  (because of     ), while in fact it is  always  X . Thus the inhabitants would no longer be able to explain  away what they see by assuming that only one, randomly chosen, value  of the voltage is real at the intermediate stage. Although such an experiment would provide evidence that multiple  histories not only exist but affect each other strongly (in the sense that  they behave differently according to whether the other is present or  absent), it does not involve inter-history  communication======================================================== little explanation of  any of them, I know of no plausible argument that they are at different  levels or can be achieved independently of each other. So I tentatively  assume that they cannot. In any case, we should expect AI to be  achieved in a jump to universality, starting from something much less  powerful. In contrast, the ability to imitate a human imperfectly or in  specialized functions is not a form of universality. It can exist in degrees.  Hence, even if chatbots did at some point start becoming much better  at imitating humans (or at fooling humans), that would still not be a  path to AI. Becoming better at pretending to think is not the same as  coming closer to being able to think. There is a philosophy whose basic tenet is that those  are  the  same. It is called  behaviourism  – which is instrumentalism applied to  psychology. In other words, it is the doctrine that psychology can only,  or should only, be the science of behaviour, not of minds; that it can  158 the beginning of infinity only measure and predict relationships between people’s external  circumstances (‘stimuli’) and their observed behaviours (‘responses’).  The latter is, unfortunately, exactly how the Turing test asks the judge  to regard a candidate AI. Hence it encouraged the attitude that if a  program could fake AI well enough, one would have achieved it. But  ultimately a non-AI program cannot fake AI. The path to AI cannot  be through ever better tricks for making chatbots more convincing. A behaviourist would no doubt ask: what exactly  is  the difference  between giving a chatbot a very rich repertoire of tricks, templates and  databases and giving it AI abilities? What is an AI program, other than  a collection of such tricks? When discussing Lamarckism in Chapter 4, I pointed out the funda- mental difference between a muscle becoming stronger in an individual’s  lifetime and muscles  evolving  to become stronger. For the former, the  knowledge to achieve all the available muscle strengths must already  be present in the individual’s genes before the sequence of changes  begins. (And so must the knowledge of how to recognize the circum- stances under which to make the changes.) This is exactly the analogue  of a ‘trick’ that a programmer has built into a chatbot: the chatbot  responds ‘as though’ it had created some of the knowledge while  composing its response, but in fact all the knowledge was created earlier  and elsewhere. The analogue of evolutionary change in a species is  creative thought in a person. The analogue of the idea that AI could be  achieved by an accumulation of chatbot tricks is Lamarckism, the theory  that new adaptations could be explained by changes that are in reality  just a manifestation of existing knowledge. There are several current areas of research in which that same  misconception is common. In chatbot-based AI research it sent the  whole field down a blind alley, but in other fields it has merely caused  researchers to attach overambitious labels to genuine, albeit relatively  modest, achievements. One such area is  artificial evolution . Recall Edison’s idea that progress requires alternating ‘inspiration’  and ‘perspiration’ phases, and that, because of computers and other  technology, it is increasingly becoming possible to automate the per  - spiration phase. This welcome development has misled those who    are overconfident about achieving artificial evolution (and AI). For  example, suppose that you are a graduate student in robotics, hoping  159 Artificial Creativity to build a robot that walks on legs better than previous robots do. The  first phase of the solution must involve inspiration – that is to say,  creative thought, attempting to improve upon previous researchers’  attempts to solve the same problem. You will start from that, and from  existing ideas about  other  problems that you conjecture may be related,  and from the designs of walking animals in nature. All of that constitutes  existing knowledge, which you will vary and combine in new ways,  and then subject to criticism and further variation. Eventually you will  have created a design for the hardware of your new robot: its legs with  their levers, joints, tendons and motors; its body, which will hold the  power supply; its sense organs, through which it will receive the  feedback that will allow it to control those limbs effectively; and    the computer that will exercise that control. You will have adapted  everything in that design as best you can to the purpose of walking,  except the program in the computer.  The function of that program will be to recognize situations such as  the robot beginning to topple over, or obstacles in its path, and to  calculate the appropriate action and to take it. This is the hardest part  of your research project. How does one recognize when it is best to  avoid an obstacle to the left or to the right, or jump over it or kick it  aside or ignore it, or lengthen one’s======================================================== namely that they are universal explainers, which makes them  universal constructors as well. The effects of that universality are,    as I have explained, explicable only by means of the full gamut of  fundamental explanations. It is also the only kind of universality  capable of transcending its parochial origins: universal computers  cannot really be universal unless there are people present to provide  energy and maintenance – indefinitely. And the same is true of all those  other technologies. Even life on Earth will eventually be extinguished,  unless people decide otherwise. Only people can rely on themselves  into the unbounded future. terminology The jump to universality   The tendency of gradually improving  systems to undergo a sudden large increase in functionality, becoming  uni    versal in some domain. meanings of ‘the beginning of infinity’  encountered in this chapter – The existence of universality in many fields. – The jump to universality. – Error-correction in computation. – The fact that people are universal explainers. – The origin of life. – The mysterious universality to which the genetic code jumped. summary All knowledge growth is by incremental improvement, but in many  fields there comes a point when one of the incremental improvements  in a system of knowledge or technology causes a sudden increase in  147 The Jump to Universality reach, making it a universal system in the relevant domain. In the past,  innovators who brought about such a jump to universality had rarely  been seeking it, but since the Enlightenment they have been, and  universal explanations have been valued both for their own sake and  for their usefulness. Because error-correction is essential in processes  of potentially unlimited length, the jump to universality only ever  happens in digital systems. 148 7 Artificial Creativity Alan Turing founded the theory of classical computation in 1936 and  helped to construct one of the first universal classical computers during  the Second World War. He is rightly known as the father of modern  computing. Babbage deserves to be called its grandfather, but, unlike  Babbage and Lovelace, Turing did understand that artificial intelligence  (AI) must in principle be possible because a universal computer is a  universal simulator. In 1950, in a paper entitled ‘Computing Machinery  and Intelligence’, he famously addressed the question:  can a machine  think?  Not only did he defend the proposition that it can, on the grounds  of universality, he also proposed a test for whether a program had  achieved it. Now known as the Turing test, it is simply that a suitable  (human) judge be unable to tell whether the program is human or not.  In that paper and subsequently, Turing sketched protocols for carrying  out his test. For instance, he suggested that both the program and a  genuine human should separately interact with the judge via some  purely textual medium such as a teleprinter, so that only the thinking  abilities of the candidates would be tested, not their appearance. Turing’s test, and his arguments, set many researchers thinking, not  only about whether he was right, but also about how to pass the test.  Programs began to be written with the intention of investigating what  might be involved in passing it.  In 1964 the computer scientist Joseph Weizenbaum wrote a program  called  Eliza , designed to imitate a psychotherapist. He deemed psycho- therapists to be an especially easy type of human to imitate because  the program could then give opaque answers about itself, and only  ask questions based on the user’s own questions and statements. It was  a remarkably simple program. Nowadays such programs are popular  149 Artificial Creativity projects for students of programming, because they are fun and easy  to write. A typical one has two basic strategies. First it    scans the input for certain keywords and grammatical forms. If this is  successful, it replies based on a template, filling in the blanks using  words in the input. For instance, given the input  I hate my job ,  the program might recognize the grammar of the sentence, involving  a possessive pronoun ‘my’, and might also recognize ‘hate’ as a keyword  from a built-in list such as ‘love/hate/like/dislike/want’, in which case  it could choose a suitable template and reply:  What do you hate  most about your job?  If it cannot parse the input to that extent,  it asks a question of its own, choosing randomly from a stock pattern  which may or may not depend on the input sentence. For instance, if  asked  How does a television work? , it might reply,  What is  so interesting about “How does a television work?”?   Or it might just ask,  Why does that interest you?  Another  strategy, used by recent internet-based versions of  Eliza , is to build up  a database of previous conversations, enabling the program simply to  repeat phrases that other users have typed in, again choosing them  according to keywords======================================================== different histories: in one, comprising  half  the original  set of universes, the couple in question are still single; in the second,  comprising a  quarter  of the original set, they are married; and in the  third, comprising the remaining quarter, they are divorced.  Thus the three histories do not occupy equal proportions of the  multiverse. There are twice as many universes in which the couple never  married as there are universes in which they divorced.  Now suppose that scientists on the starship know about the multi- verse and understand the physics of the transporter. (Though note that  we have not yet given them a way of discovering those things.) Then  they know that, when they run the transporter, an infinite number of  fungible instances of themselves, all sharing the same history, are doing  so at the same time. They know that a voltage surge will occur in half  the universes in that history, which means that it will split into two  histories of equal measure. Hence they know that, if they use a voltmeter  capable of detecting the surge, half of the instances of themselves are  going to find that it has recorded one, and the other half are not. But  they also know that it is meaningless to ask (not merely impossible to  know)  which  event they will experience. Consequently they can make  two closely related predictions. One is that, despite the perfect deter- minism of everything that is happening,  nothing  can reliably predict  for them whether the voltmeter will detect a surge.  The other prediction is simply that the voltmeter will record a surge  with probability one-half. Thus the outcomes of such experiments are  subjectively random  (from the perspective of any observer) even though  278 the beginning of infinity everything that is happening is completely determined objectively. This  is also the origin of quantum-mechanical randomness and probability  in real physics: it is due to the measure that the theory provides for  the multiverse, which is in turn due to what kinds of physical processes  the theory allows and forbids. Notice that when a random outcome (in this sense) is about to  happen, it is a situation of diversity within fungibility: the diversity is  in the variable ‘what outcome they are  going  to see’. The logic of the  situation is the same as in cases like that of the bank account I discussed  above, except that this time the fungible entities are people. They are  fungible, yet half of them are going to see the surge and the other half  not. In practice they could test this prediction by doing the experiment  many times. Every formula purporting to predict the sequence of  outcomes will eventually fail: that tests the unpredictability. And in  the overwhelming majority of universes (and histories) the surge will  happen approximately half the time: that tests the predicted value of  the probability. Only a tiny proportion of the instances of the observers  will see anything different.  Our story continues. In one of the histories, the newspapers on the  astronauts’ home planets report the engagement. They fill many  column-inches with reports about the accident that brought the  astronauts together and so on. In the other history, where there is no  astronaut-engagement news, one newspaper fills the same space on the  page with a short story. It happens to be about a romance on a starship.  Some of the sentences in that story are identical to sentences in the  news items in the other history. The same words, printed in the same  column in the same newspaper, are fungible between the two histories;  but they are fiction in one history and fact in the other. So here the  fact/fiction attribute has diversity within fungibility. The number of distinct histories will now increase rapidly. Whenever  the transporter is used, it takes only microseconds for the sphere of  differentiation to engulf the whole starship, so, if it is typically used  ten times per day, the number of distinct histories inside the whole  starship will double about ten times a day. Within a month there will  be more distinct histories than there are atoms in our visible universe.  Most of them will be extremely similar to many others, because in only  279 The Multiverse a small proportion will the precise timing and magnitude of the voltage  surge be just right to precipitate a noticeable,  Sliding Doors -type  change. Nevertheless, the number of histories continues to increase  exponentially, and soon there are so many variations on events that  several significant changes have been caused  somewhere  in the multi- versal diversity of the starship. So the total number of such histories  increases exponentially too, even though they continue to constitute  only a small proportion of all histories that are present. Soon after that, in an even smaller but still exponentially grow-  ing number of histories, uncanny chains of ‘accidents’ and ‘unlikely  coincidences’ will have come to dominate events. I======================================================== information: one cannot send a message to  the other universe; nor can one change anything in one’s own universe  sooner than light could reach that thing. Nor can one bring new  information – even random information – into the world: everything  that happens is determined by laws of physics from what has gone  before. However, one can, of course, bring new  knowledge  into the  world. Knowledge consists of explanations, and none of those conditions  prevents the creation of new explanations. All this is true of the real  world too. We can temporarily think of the two universes as being literally  parallel. Suppress the third dimension of space and think of a universe  264 the beginning of infinity as being two-dimensional, like an infinitely flat television. Then place  a second such television parallel to it, showing exactly the same pictures  (symbolizing the objects in the two universes). Now forget the material  of which the televisions are made. Only the pictures exist. This is to  stress that a universe is not a receptacle containing physical objects: it  is  those objects. In real physics, even space is a physical object, capable  of warping and affecting matter and being affected by it. So now we have two perfectly parallel, identical universes, each  including an instance of our starship, its crew and its transporter, and  of the whole of space. Because of the symmetry between them, it is  now misleading to call one of them ‘the ordinary universe’ and the  other ‘the phantom zone’. So I shall just call them ‘universes’. The two  of them together (which comprise the whole of physical reality in the  story so far) are the  multiverse . Similarly, it is misleading to speak of  the ‘original’ object and its ‘ doppelgänger ’: they are simply the two  instances  of the object. If our science-fiction speculation were to stop there, the two universes  would have to remain identical for ever. There is nothing logically  impossible about that. Yet it would make our story fatally flawed both  as fiction and as scientific speculation – and for the same reason: it is  a story of two universes, but only one  history . That is to say, there is  only one script about what is really there in both universes. Considered  as fiction, therefore, it is really a single-universe story in a pointless  disguise. Considered as scientific speculation, it describes a world that  would not be explicable to its inhabitants. For how could they ever  argue that their history takes place in two universes and not three or  thirty? Why not two today and thirty tomorrow? Moreover, since their  world has only one history, all their good explanations about nature  would be about that history. That single history would be what they  meant by their ‘world’ or ‘universe’. Nothing of the underlying two-ness  of their reality would be accessible to them, nor would it make any  more sense to them as an explanation than would three-ness or thirty- ness – yet they would be factually mistaken.  A remark about explanation: Although the story so far would be a  bad explanation from the inhabitants’ point of view, it is not necessarily  bad from ours. Imagining inexplicable worlds can help us to understand  the nature of explicability. I have already imagined some inexplicable  265 The Multiverse worlds for that very reason in previous chapters, and I shall imagine  more in this chapter. But, in the end, I want to tell of an explicable  world, and it will be ours. A remark about terminology: The  world  is the whole of physical  reality. In classical (pre-quantum) physics, the world was thought to  consist of one  universe  – something like a whole three-dimensional  space for the whole of time, and all its contents. According to quantum  physics, as I shall explain, the world is a much larger and more com  - plicated object, a  multiverse , which includes many such universes  (among other things). And a  history  is a sequence of events happening  to objects and possibly their identical counterparts. So, in my story so  far, the world is a multiverse that consists of two universes but has  only a single history.  So our two universes must not stay identical. Something like a  transporter malfunction will have to make them different. Yet, as I  said, that may seem to have been ruled out by those restrictions on  information flow. The laws of physics in the fictional multiverse are  deterministic and symmetrical. So what can the transporter possibly  do that would make the two universes differ? It may seem that whatever  one instance of it does to one universe, its  doppelgänger  must be doing  to the other, so the universes can only remain the same. Surprisingly, that is not so. It  is  consistent for two identical entities  to become different under deterministic and symmetrical laws. But, for  that to happen, they must initially be more than just exact images of  each other: they must be  fungible  (the  g  is pronounced as in ‘plunger’),  by======================================================== physical  world that we shall never know. I expect that one day we shall have  the technology to measure the number of grains of sand on Earth  exactly, but I doubt that we shall ever know what the exact number  was in Archimedes’ time. Indeed, I have already mentioned more drastic  limitations on what can be known and achieved. There are the direct  limitations imposed by the universal laws of physics – we cannot exceed  the speed of light, and so on. Then there are the limitations of epis- temology: we cannot create knowledge other than by the fallible method  of conjecture and criticism; errors are inevitable, and only error- correcting processes can succeed or continue for long. None of this  contradicts the maxim, because none of those limitations need ever  cause an unresolvable conflict of explanations. Hence I conjecture that, in mathematics as well as in science and  philosophy,  if the question is interesting, then the problem is soluble.  Fallibilism tells us that we can be mistaken about what is interesting.  And so, three corollaries follow from this conjecture. The first is that  inherently insoluble problems are inherently uninteresting. The second  is that, in the long run, the distinction between what is interesting and  193 A Window on Infinity what is boring is not a matter of subjective taste but an objective fact.  And the third corollary is that the interesting problem of  why  every  problem that is interesting is also soluble is itself soluble. At present  we do not know why the laws of physics seem fine-tuned; we do not  know why various forms of universality exist (though we do know of  many connections between them); we do not know why the world is  explicable. But eventually we shall. And when we do, there will be  infinitely more left to explain. The most important of all limitations on knowledge-creation is that  we cannot prophesy: we cannot predict the content of ideas yet to be  created, or their effects. This limitation is not only consistent with the  unlimited growth of knowledge, it is entailed by it, as I shall explain  in the next chapter. That problems are soluble does not mean that we already know    their solutions, or can generate them to order. That would be akin to  creationism. The biologist Peter Medawar described science as ‘the art  of the soluble’, but the same applies to all forms of knowledge. All  kinds of creative thought involve judgements about what approaches  might or might not work. Gaining or losing interest in particular  problems or sub-problems is part of the creative process and itself  constitutes problem-solving. So whether ‘problems are soluble’ does  not depend on whether any given question can be answered, or  answered by a particular thinker on a particular day. But if  progress  ever depended on violating a law of physics, then ‘problems are soluble’  would be false.  terminology One-to-one correspondence   Tallying each member of one set with  each member of another.

It makes sense, both in mathematics and in physics. But    it has======================================================== as   Μ .  If only they had allowed that rule to generate multi-tier numerals, so  that  M  would mean twenty-four myriad myriad, the system would have  been universal. But apparently they never did. Even more surprisingly,  nor did Archimedes. His system used a different idea, similar to modern  ‘scientific notation’ (in which, say, two million is written 2  ×  10 6 ), except  that instead of powers of ten it used powers of a myriad myriad. But,  again, he then required the exponent (the power to which the myriad  myriad was raised) to be an existing Greek numeral – that is to say, it  could not easily exceed a myriad myriad or so. Hence this construction  petered out after the number that we call 10 800,000,000 . If only he had  not imposed that additional rule, he would have had a universal system,  albeit an unnecessarily awkward one. Even today, only mathematicians ever need numbers above 10 800,000,000 ,  and only rarely at that. But that cannot be why Archimedes imposed  the restriction, for he did not stop there. Exploring the concept of  numbers further, he set up yet another extension, this time amounting  to an even more unwieldy system with base 10 800,000,000 . Yet, once again,  he allowed this number to be raised only to powers not exceeding  800,000,000, thus imposing an arbitrary limit somewhere in excess  of 10 6.4  ×  10 17 .  Why? Today it seems very perverse of Archimedes to have placed  limits on which symbols could be used at which positions in his  numerals. There is no mathematical justification for them. But, if  Archimedes had been willing to allow his rules to be applied without  arbitrary limits, he could have invented a much better universal system  just by removing the arbitrary limits from the existing Greek system.  A few years later the mathematician Apollonius invented yet another  κδ κδ Μ 133 The Jump to Universality system of numerals which fell short of universality for the same reason.  It is as though everyone in the ancient world was avoiding universality  on purpose. The mathematician Pierre Simon Laplace (1749–1827) wrote, of the  Indian system, ‘We shall appreciate the grandeur of this achievement  when we remember that it escaped the genius of Archimedes and  Apollonius, two of the greatest minds produced by antiquity.’ But was  this really something that escaped them, or something that they chose  to steer clear of? Archimedes must have been aware that his method  of extending a number system – which he used twice in succession –  could be continued indefinitely. But perhaps he doubted that the result- ing numerals would refer to anything about which one could validly  reason. Indeed, one motivation for that whole project was to contradict  the idea – which was a truism at the time – that the grains of sand on  a beach could literally not be numbered. So he used his system to  calculate the number of grains of sand that would be needed to fill the  entire celestial sphere. This suggests that he, and ancient Greek culture  in general, may not have had the concept of an abstract number at all,  so that, for them, numerals could refer only to objects – if only objects  of the imagination. In that case universality would have been a difficult  property to grasp, let alone to aspire to. Or maybe he merely felt that  he had to avoid aspiring to infinite reach in order to make a convincing  case. At any rate, although from our perspective Archimedes’ system  repeatedly ‘tried’ to jump to universality, he apparently did not want  it to.  Here is an even more speculative possibility. The largest benefits of  any universality, beyond whatever parochial problem it is intended to  solve, come from its being useful for further innovation. And innovation  is unpredictable. So, to appreciate universality at the time of its dis  - covery, one must either value abstract knowledge for its own sake or  expect it to yield unforeseeable benefits. In a society that rarely ex    - perienced change, both those attitudes would be quite unnatural. But  that was reversed with the Enlightenment, whose quintessential idea  is, as I have said, that  progress  is both desirable and attainable. And  so, therefore, is universality.  Be that as it may, with the Enlightenment, parochialism and all  arbitrary exceptions and limitations began to be regarded as inherently  134 the beginning of infinity problematic – and not only in science. Why should the law treat an  aristocrat differently from a commoner? A slave from a master? A  woman from a man? Enlightenment philosophers such as Locke set  out to free political institutions from arbitrary rules and assumptions.  Others tried to derive moral maxims from universal moral explanations  rather than merely to postulate them dogmatically. Thus universal  explanatory theories of justice, legitimacy and morality began to take  their place alongside universal theories of matter and motion. In all  those cases, universality was being sought deliberately,======================================================== become impossible – an event that is now known simply as ‘the  Singularity’. Vinge associated the approaching Singularity with the  achievement of AI, and subsequent discussions have centred on that. I  certainly  hope  that AI is achieved by then, but I see no sign yet of the  theoretical progress that I have argued must come first. On the other  hand, I see no reason to single out AI as a mould-breaking technology:  we already have billions of humans.  Most advocates of the Singularity believe that, soon after the AI  breakthrough,  superhuman  minds will be constructed and that then,  as Vinge put it, ‘the human era will be over.’ But my discussion of the  universality of human minds rules out that possibility. Since humans  are already universal explainers and constructors, they can already  transcend their parochial origins, so there can be no such thing as a  superhuman mind as such. There can only be further automation,  allowing the existing kind of human thinking to be carried out faster,  and with more working memory, and delegating ‘perspiration’ phases  to (non-AI) automata. A great deal of this has already happened with  computers and other machinery, as well as with the general increase  in wealth which has multiplied the number of humans who are able  to spend their time thinking. This can indeed be expected to continue.  For instance, there will be ever-more-efficient human–computer inter- faces, no doubt culminating in add-ons for the brain. But tasks like  internet searching will never be carried out by super-fast AIs scanning  billions of documents creatively for meaning, because they will not  want to perform such tasks any more than humans do. Nor will  artificial scientists, mathematicians and philosophers ever wield con  - cepts or arguments that humans are inherently incapable of under- standing. Universality implies that, in every important sense, humans  and AIs will never be other than equal. Similarly, the Singularity is often assumed to be a moment of  457 The Beginning unprecedented upheaval and danger, as the rate of innovation becomes  too rapid for humans to cope with. But this is a parochial miscon- ception. During the first few centuries of the Enlightenment, there has  been a constant feeling that rapid and accelerating innovation is getting  out of hand. But our capacity to cope with, and enjoy, changes in our  technology, lifestyle, ethical norms and so on has been increasing too,  with the weakening and extinction of some of the anti-rational memes  that used to sabotage it. In future, when the rate of innovation will  also increase due to the sheer increasing clock rate and throughput of  brain add-ons and AI computers, then our capacity to cope with that  will increase at the same rate or faster: if everyone were suddenly able  to think a million times as fast, no one would feel hurried as a result.  Hence I think that the concept of the Singularity as a sort of discon- tinuity is a mistake. Knowledge will continue to grow exponentially  or even faster, and that is astounding enough. The economist Robin Hanson has suggested that there have been  several singularities in the history of our species, such as the agricultural  revolution and the industrial revolution. Arguably, even the early  Enlightenment was a ‘singularity’ by that definition. Who could have  predicted that someone who lived through the English Civil War – a  bloody struggle of religious fanatics versus an absolute monarch – and  through the victory of the religious fanatics in 1651, might also live  through the peaceful birth of a society that saw liberty and reason    as its principal characteristics? The Royal Society, for instance, was  founded in 1660 – a development that would hardly have been con  - ceivable a generation earlier. Roy Porter marks 1688 as the beginning  of the English Enlightenment. That is the date of the ‘Glorious Revo- lution’, the beginning of predominantly constitutional government  along with many other rational reforms which were part of that deeper  and astonishingly rapid shift in the prevailing world view. Also, the time beyond which scientific prediction has no access is  different for different phenomena. For each phenomenon it is the  moment at which the creation of new knowledge may begin to make  a significant difference to what one is trying to predict. Since our  estimates of that, too, are subject to the same kind of horizon, we  should really understand  all  our predictions as implicitly including the  proviso ‘unless the creation of new knowledge intervenes’.  458 the beginning of infinity Some explanations do have reach into the distant future, far beyond  the horizons that make most other things unpredictable. One of them  is that fact itself. Another is the infinite potential of explanatory  knowledge – the subject of this book.

Unweaving the Rainbow  (1998) An ‘orderly’ (explicable) universe is indeed more beautiful (see Chapter  14) – though the assumption that to be orderly it has to be ‘indifferent  to human preoccupations’ is a misconception associated with the  Principle of Mediocrity.  Any assumption that the world is  in explicable can lead only to  54 the beginning of infinity extremely bad explanations. For an inexplicable world is indistinguish- able from one ‘tricked out with capricious ad hoc magic’: by definition,  no hypothesis about the world outside the bubble of explicability can  be a better explanation than that Zeus rules there – or practically any  myth or fantasy one likes.  Moreover, since the outside of the bubble affects our explanations  of the inside (or else we may as well do without it), the inside is not  really explicable either. It seems so only if we carefully refrain from  asking certain questions. This bears an uncanny resemblance to the  intellectual landscape before the Enlightenment, with its distinction  between Earth and heaven. It is a paradox inherent in the Principle of  Mediocrity: contrary to its motivation, here it is forcing us back to an  archaic, anthropocentric, pre-scientific conception of the world. At root, the Principle of Mediocrity and the Spaceship Earth metaphor  overlap in a claim about  reach : they both claim that the reach of the  distinctively human way of being – that is to say, the way of problem- solving, knowledge-creating and adapting the world around us – is  bounded. And they argue that its bounds cannot be very far beyond  what it has already reached. Trying to go beyond that range must lead  to failure and catastrophe respectively. Both ideas also rely on essentially the same argument, namely that  if there were no such limit, there would be no explanation for the  continued effectiveness of the adaptations of the human brain beyond  the conditions under which they evolved. Why should one adaptation  out of the trillions that have ever existed on Earth have unlimited reach,  when all others reach only inside the tiny, insignificant, untypical  biosphere? Fair enough: all reach has an explanation. But what if there  is  an explanation, and what if it has nothing to do with evolution or  the biosphere? Imagine that a flock of birds from a species that evolved on one  island happens to fly to another. Their wings and eyes still work. That  is an example of the reach of those adaptations. It has an explanation,  the essence of which is that wings and eyes exploit universal laws of  physics (of aerodynamics and optics respectively). They exploit those  laws only imperfectly; but the atmospheric and lighting conditions on  the two islands are sufficiently similar, by the criteria defined by those  laws, for the same adaptations to work on both. 55 The Spark Thus the birds may well be able to fly to an island many kilometres  away horizontally, but if they were transported only a few kilometres  upwards their wings would stop working because the density of the  air would be too low. Their implicit knowledge about how to fly fails  at high altitude. A little further up, their eyes and other organs would  stop working. The design of these too does not have that much reach:  all vertebrate eyes are filled with liquid water, but water freezes at  stratospheric temperatures and boils in the vacuum of space. Less  dramatically, the birds might also die if they merely had no good night  vision and they reached an island where the only suitable prey organisms  were nocturnal. For the same reason, biological adaptations also have  limited reach in regard to changes in their  home  environment – which  can and do cause extinctions.  If those birds’ adaptations do have enough reach to make the species  viable on the new island, they will set up a colony there. In subsequent  generations, mutants slightly better adapted to the new island will end  up having slightly more offspring on average, so evolution will adapt  the population more accurately to contain the knowledge needed to  make a living there. The ancestor species of humans colonized new  habitats and embarked on new lifestyles in exactly that way. But by  the time our species had evolved, our fully human ancestors were  achieving much the same thing thousands of times faster, by evolving  their cultural knowledge instead. Because they did not yet know how  to do science, their knowledge was only a little less parochial than  biological knowledge. It consisted of rules of thumb. And so progress,  though rapid compared to biological evolution, was sluggish compared  to what the Enlightenment has accustomed us to. Since the Enlightenment, technological progress has depended  specifically on the creation of explanatory knowledge. People had  dreamed for millennia of flying to the moon, but it was only with the  advent of Newton’s======================================================== on  Earth. Suppose, for instance, that there was a prehistoric continent,  isolated from the others, on which evolution happened several times  as fast as elsewhere, and that, by convergent evolution, a rabbit-like  creature evolved there during the Cambrian era; and suppose that the  continents were later connected by a catastrophe that obliterated most  96 the beginning of infinity of the life forms on that continent and submerged their fossils. The  rabbit-like creature was a rare survivor which became extinct soon  afterwards. Given the supposed evidence, that is still an infinitely better  explanation than, for instance, creationism or Lamarckism, neither of  which gives  any  account of the origin of the apparent knowledge in  the rabbit. So what  would  refute the Darwinian theory of evolution? Evidence  which, in the light of the best available explanation, implies that  knowledge came into existence in a different way. For instance, if    an organism was observed to undergo only (or mainly) favourable  mutations, as predicted by Lamarckism or spontaneous generation,  then Darwinism’s ‘random variation’ postulate would be refuted. If  organisms were observed to be born with new, complex adaptations  – for anything – of which there were no precursors in their parents,  then the gradual-change prediction would be refuted and so would  Darwinism’s mechanism of knowledge-creation. If an organism was  born with a complex adaptation that has survival value today, yet was  not favoured by selection pressure in its ancestry (say, an ability to  detect and use internet weather forecasts to decide when to hibernate),  then Darwinism would again be refuted. A fundamentally new ex    - planation would be needed. Facing more or less the same unsolved  problem that Paley and Darwin faced, we should have to set about  finding an explanation that worked. Fine-tuning The physicist Brandon Carter calculated in 1974 that if the strength  of the interaction between charged particles were a few per cent smaller,  no planets would ever have formed and the only condensed objects in  the universe would be stars; and if it were a few per cent greater, then  no stars would ever explode, and so no elements other than hydrogen  and helium would exist outside them. In either case there would be no  complex chemistry and hence presumably no life. Another example: if the initial expansion rate of the universe at the  Big Bang had been slightly higher, no stars would have formed and  there would be nothing in the universe but hydrogen – at an extremely  low and ever-decreasing density. If it had been slightly lower, the  97 Creation universe would have recollapsed soon after the Big Bang. Similar results  have been since obtained for other constants of physics that are not  determined by any known theory. For most, if not all of them, it seems  that if they had been slightly different, there would have been no  possibility for life to exist. This is a remarkable fact which has even been cited as evidence that  those constants were intentionally fine-tuned, i.e. designed, by a super- natural being. This is a new version of creationism, and of the design  argument, now based on the appearance of design  in the laws of physics .  (Ironically, given the history of this controversy, the new argument is  that the laws of physics must have been designed to create a biosphere  by Darwinian evolution .) It even persuaded the philosopher Antony  Flew – formerly an enthusiastic advocate of atheism – of the existence  of a supernatural designer. But it should not have. As I shall explain in  a moment, it is not even clear that this fine-tuning constitutes an  appearance of design in Paley’s sense; but, even if it does, that does    not alter the fact that invoking the supernatural makes for a bad  explanation. And, in any case, arguing for supernatural explanations  on the grounds that a current scientific explanation is flawed or lacking  is just a mistake. As we carved in stone in Chapter 3, problems are  inevitable – there are always unsolved problems. But they get solved.  Science continues to make progress even, or especially, after making  great discoveries, because the discoveries themselves reveal further  problems. Therefore the existence of an unsolved problem in physics  is no more evidence for a supernatural explanation than the existence  of an unsolved crime is evidence that a ghost committed it.  A simple objection to the idea that fine-tuning requires an explanation  at all is that we have no good explanation implying that planets are  essential to the formation of life, or that chemistry is. The physicist  Robert Forward wrote a superb science-fiction story,  Dragon’s Egg ,  based on the premise that information could be stored and processed  – and life and intelligence could evolve – through the interactions  between neutrons on the surface of a neutron star (a star that has  collapsed gravitationally to a diameter of only a======================================================== put those terms in  quotation marks because those events are not in the least accidental.  They have all happened inevitably, according to deterministic laws of  physics. All of them were caused by the transporter.  Here is another situation where, if we are not careful, common sense  makes false assumptions about the physical world, and can make  descriptions of situations sound paradoxical even though the situations  themselves are quite straightforward. Dawkins gives an example in his  book  Unweaving the Rainbow ,   analysing the claim that a television  psychic was making accurate predictions: There are about 100,000 five-minute periods in a year. The probability  that any given watch, say mine, will stop in a designated five-minute  period is about 1 in 100,000. Low odds, but there are 10 million people  watching the [television psychic’s] show. If only half of them are wearing  watches, we could expect about 25 of those watches to stop in any given  minute. If only a quarter of these ring in to the studio, that is 6 calls,  more than enough to dumbfound a naive audience. Especially when you  add in the calls from people whose watches stopped the day before,  people whose watches didn’t stop but whose grandfather clocks did,  people who died of heart attacks and their bereaved relatives phoned in  to say that their ‘ticker’ gave out, and so on. As this example shows, the fact that certain circumstances can  explain  other events without being in any way involved in  causing  them is very  familiar despite being counter-intuitive. The ‘naive’ audience’s mistake  is a form of parochialism: they observe a phenomenon – people phoning  in because their watches stopped – but they are failing to understand  280 the beginning of infinity it as part of a wider phenomenon, most of which they do not observe.  Though the unobserved parts of that wider phenomenon have in no  way affected what we, the viewers, observe, they are essential to its  explanation. Similarly, common sense and classical physics contain the  parochial error that only one history exists. This error, built into our  language and conceptual framework, makes it sound odd to say that  an event can be in one sense extremely unlikely and in another certain  to happen. But there is nothing odd about it in reality.  We are now seeing the interior of the spaceship as an overwhelmingly  complex jumble of superposed objects. Most locations on board are  packed with people, some of them on very unusual errands, and all  unable to perceive each other. The spaceship itself is on many slightly  different courses, due to slightly different behaviours of the crew. Of  course we are ‘seeing’ this only in our mind’s eye. Our fictional laws  of physics ensure that no observer in the multiverse itself would see  anything like that. Consequently, on closer inspection (in our mind’s  eye), we also see that there is great order and regularity in that apparent  chaos. For instance, although there is a flurry of human figures in the  Captain’s chair, we see that most of them are the Captain; and although  there is a flurry of human figures in the Navigator’s chair, we see that  few of them are the Captain. Regularities of that kind are ultimately  due to the fact that all the universes, despite their differences, obey the  same laws of physics (including their initial conditions).  We also see that any particular instance of the Captain only ever  interacts with one instance of the Navigator, and one instance of the  First Officer; and those instances of the Navigator and First Officer  are precisely the ones that interact with each other. These regularities  are due to the fact that the histories are nearly autonomous: what  happens in each of them depends almost entirely on previous events  in that history alone – with transporter-induced voltage surges being  the only exceptions. In the story so far, this autonomy of the histories  is rather a trivial fact, since we began by making the  universes  autonomous. But it is going to be worth becoming even more pedantic  for a moment: what exactly is the difference between the instance of  you that I can interact with and the ones that are imperceptible to me?  The latter are ‘in other universes’ – but, remember, universes consist  only of the objects in them, so that amounts only to saying I can see  281 The Multiverse the ones that I can see. The upshot is that our laws of physics must  also say that every object carries within it information about which  instances of it could interact with which instances of other objects  (except when the instances are fungible, when there is no such thing  as ‘which’). Quantum theory describes such information. It is known  as  entanglement  information.* So far in the story we have set up a vast, complex world which looks  very unfamiliar in our mind’s eye, but to the overwhelming majority of  the inhabitants looks almost exactly like the single universe of our  everyday======================================================== 112, 113, 256, 446 knowledge   78 in adaptation  55, 56–65, 78–81, 88;

But truth does exist in all those fields, and  progress towards it is made by seeking good explanations. Problems  are inevitable, because our knowledge will always be infinitely far from  complete. Some problems are hard, but it is a mistake to confuse hard  problems with problems unlikely to be solved. Problems are soluble,  and each particular evil is a problem that can be solved. An optimistic  civilization is open and not afraid to innovate, and is based on traditions  of criticism. Its institutions keep improving, and the most important  knowledge that they embody is knowledge of how to detect and  eliminate errors. There may have been many short-lived enlightenments  in history. Ours has been uniquely long-lived. 223 10 A Dream of Socrates socrates  is staying at an inn near the Temple of the Oracle at Delphi.  Together with his friend  chaerephon , he has today asked the Oracle  who the wisest man in the world is,* so that they might go and learn  from him. But, to their annoyance, the priestess (who provides the  Oracle’s voice on behalf of the god Apollo) merely announced, ‘No  one is wiser than Socrates.’ Sleeping now on an uncomfortable bed in  a tiny and exorbitantly expensive room,  socrates  hears a deep,  melodious voice intoning his name. hermes:  Greetings, Socrates. socrates: [ Draws the blanket over his head. ] Go away. I’ve already  made too many offerings today and you’re not going to wring any  more out of me. I am too ‘wise’ for that, hadn’t you heard? hermes: I  seek no offering. socrates:  Then what do you want? [ He turns and sees  hermes ,  who is naked. ] Well, I’m sure that some of my associates camped  outside will be glad to – hermes: It is  not them I seek, but you, O Socrates. socrates:  Then you shall be disappointed, stranger. Now kindly leave  me to my hard-earned rest. hermes: V ery well. [ He makes towards the door. ] socrates: W ait. hermes: [ Turns and raises a quizzical eyebrow. ] *In the story as told by Plato in his  Apology , Chaerophon asks the Oracle  whether   there is anyone wiser than Socrates, and is told no. But would he really have wasted  this expensive and solemn privilege on a question with only two possible answers, one  flattering, the other frustrating, and neither very interesting? 224 the beginning of infinity socrates: [ slowly and deliberately ] I am asleep. Dreaming. And you  are the god Apollo. hermes:  What makes you think so? socrates:  These precincts are sacred to you. It is night-time and there  is no lamp, yet I see you clearly. This is not possible in real life. So  you must be coming to me in a dream.  hermes: You  reason coolly. Are you not afraid? socrates:  Bah! I ask you in return: are you a benevolent or a  malevolent god? If benevolent, then what do I have to fear? If  malevolent, then I disdain to fear you. We Athenians are a proud  people – and protected by our goddess, as you surely know. Twice  we defeated the Persian Empire against overwhelming odds,* and  now we are defying Sparta. It is our custom to defy anyone who  seeks our submission.  hermes:  Even a god? socrates: A  benevolent god would not seek it. On the other hand,  it is also our custom to give a hearing to anyone who offers us honest  criticism, seeking to persuade us freely to change our minds. For we  want to do what is right.  hermes:  Those two customs are two sides of the same valuable coin,  Socrates. I give you Athenians great credit for honouring them. socrates: My  city is surely deserving of your favour. But why would  an immortal want to converse with such a confused and ignorant  person as me? I think I can guess your reason: you have repented of  your little joke via the Oracle, haven’t you? Indeed, it was rather  cruel of you to send us only a mocking answer, considering the  distance we have come and the offerings we have made. So please  tell me the truth this time, O fount of wisdom: who is really the  wisest man in the world? hermes: I  reveal no facts. socrates: [ Sighs. ] Then I beg you – I have always wanted to know  this: what is the nature of virtue? hermes: I  reveal no moral truths either. *In this dialogue, Socrates sometimes exaggerates the attributes and achievements    of his beloved home city-state, Athens. In this case he is ignoring the contributions of  other Greek city-states to the defeats of two invasion attempts by the Persian Empire,  both of them before he was born. 225 A Dream of Socrates socrates: Yet, as a  benevolent god, you must have come here to impart  some  sort of knowledge. What sort will you deign to grant me? hermes:  Knowledge about knowledge, Socrates.  Epistemology.  I have  already mentioned some. socrates: You  have? Oh – you said that you honour Athenians for  our openness to persuasion. And for our defiance of bullies. But it  is well known that those are virtues! Surely telling me what I already======================================================== why that must be so, starting with the fallibility  of the human mind and the unreliability of sensory experience.  plato : [ Scribbles,   ‘It’s only knowledge  of the material world  that’s  impossible, useless and undesirable.’ ] socrates: He  gave me a marvellous perspective on how we perceive  the world. Each of your eyes is like a dark little cave, one on whose  rear wall some stray shadows fall from outside. You spend your  whole life at the back of that cave, able to see nothing but that rear  wall, so you cannot see reality directly at all.  plato : [ Scribbles,   ‘It is as if we were prisoners, chained inside a cave  and permitted to look only at the rear wall. We can never know the  253 A Dream of Socrates reality outside because we see only fleeting, distorted shadows of it.’ ] [Note: Socrates is slightly improving on Hermes, and Plato has  been increasingly misinterpreting Socrates.] socrates: He  then went on to explain to me that objective knowledge  is indeed possible: it comes from within! It begins as conjecture, and  is then  corrected  by repeated cycles of criticism, including comparison  with the evidence on our ‘wall’.  plato : [ Scribbles,   ‘The only true knowledge is that which comes from  within. (How? Remembered from a previous life?)’ ] socrates: In  this way, we frail and fallible humans can come to know  objective reality – provided we use philosophically sound methods  as I have described (which most people do not). plato : [ Scribbles,   ‘We can come to know the true world beyond the  illusory world of experience. But only by pursuing the kingly art of  philosophy.’ ] chaerephon:  Socrates, I think it  was  the god speaking to you, for I  strongly feel that I have glimpsed a divine truth through you today.  It will take me a long time to reorganize my ideas to take account  of this new epistemology that he revealed to you. It seems a  tremendously far-reaching, and important, subject. socrates:  Indeed. I have some reorganizing to do myself. plato : Socrates, you really ought to write all this down – together  with all your other wisdom – for the benefit of the whole world, and  posterity. socrates: No  need, Aristocles. Posterity is right here, listening.  Posterity is all of  you , my friends. What is the point of writing down  things that are going to be endlessly tinkered with and improved?  Rather than make a permanent record of all my misconceptions as  they are at a particular instant, I would rather offer them to others  in two-way debate. That way I benefit from criticism and may even  make improvements myself. Whatever is valuable will survive such  debates and be passed on without any effort from me. Whatever is  not valuable would only make me look a fool to future generations. plato : If you say so, Master. Since Socrates left us no writings, historians of ideas can only guess at  what he really thought and taught, using the indirect evidence of his  254 the beginning of infinity portrayal by Plato and a few others who were there at the time and  whose accounts have survived. This is known as the ‘Socratic problem’,  and is the source of much controversy. One common view is that the  young Plato conveyed Socrates’ philosophy fairly faithfully, but that  later he used the character of Socrates more as a vehicle for conveying  his own views; that he did not even intend his dialogues to represent  the real Socrates, but used them only as convenient ways of expressing  arguments that have a to-and-fro form.  Perhaps I had better stress – in case it is not already obvious – that  I am doing the same. I do not intend the above dialogue accurately to  represent the philosophical opinions of the historical Socrates and  Plato. I have set it at that moment in history, with those participants,  because Socrates and his circle were among the foremost contributors  to the ‘Golden Age of Athens’, which should have become a beginning  of infinity but did not. And also because one thing that we do know  about the ancient Greeks is that the philosophical  problems  they  considered important have dominated Western philosophy ever since:  How is knowledge obtained? How can we distinguish between true  and false, right and wrong, reason and unreason? Which sorts of  knowledge (moral, empirical, theological, mathematical, justified . . . )  are possible, and which are mere chimeras? And so on. And therefore,  although the theory of knowledge presented in the dialogue is largely  that of the twentieth-century philosopher Karl Popper, together with  some addenda of my own, I guess that Socrates would have understood  and liked it. In some universes that were very like ours at the time, he  thought of it himself. I do want to make one indirect comment on the Socratic problem,  though: we habitually underestimate the difficulty of communication  – just as Socrates does at the end of the dialogue, when he assumes  that each party to a debate necessarily knows what the other is saying,======================================================== self-sufficient colony on the moon, powered  by sunlight, recycling its waste, and obtaining raw materials from the  moon itself. Oxygen is plentiful on the moon in the form of metal  oxides in moon rock. Many other elements could easily be extracted  too. Some elements are rare on the moon, and so in practice these  would be supplied from the Earth, but in principle the colony could  be entirely independent of the Earth if it sent robot space vehicles    58 the beginning of infinity to mine asteroids for such elements, or if it manufactured them by  transmutation.  I specified  robot  space vehicles because all technological knowledge  can eventually be implemented in automated devices. This is another  reason that ‘one per cent inspiration and ninety-nine per cent perspir- ation’ is a misleading description of how progress happens:  the ‘per  - spiration’ phase can be automated  – just as the task of recognizing  galaxies on astronomical photographs was. And the more advanced  technology becomes, the shorter is the gap between inspiration and  automation. The more this happens in the moon colony, the less human  effort will be required to live there. Eventually the moon colonists will  take air for granted, just as the people now living in Oxfordshire take  for granted that water will flow if they turn on a tap. If either of those  populations lacked the right knowledge, their environment would soon  kill them.  We are accustomed to thinking of the Earth as hospitable and the  moon as a bleak, faraway deathtrap. But that is how our ancestors  would have regarded Oxfordshire, and, ironically, it is how I, today,  would regard the primeval Great Rift Valley. In the unique case of  humans, the difference between a hospitable environment and a death- trap depends on what knowledge they have created. Once enough  knowledge has been embodied in the lunar colony, the colonists can  devote their thoughts and energies to creating even more knowledge,  and soon it will cease to be a colony and become simply home. No  one will think of the moon as a fringe habitat, distinguished from our  ‘natural’ environment on Earth, any more than we now think of  Oxfordshire as being fundamentally different from the Great Rift  Valley as a place to live. Using knowledge to cause automated physical transformations is,  in itself, not unique to humans. It is the basic method by which all  organisms keep themselves alive: every cell is a chemical factory.    The difference between humans and other species is in what kind of  knowledge they can use (explanatory instead of rule-of-thumb) and  in how they create it (conjecture and criticism of ideas, rather than the  variation and selection of genes). It is precisely those two differences  that explain why every other organism can function only in a certain  range of environments that are hospitable to it, while humans transform  59 The Spark in hospitable environments like the biosphere into support systems for  themselves. And, while every other organism is a factory for converting  resources of a fixed type into more such organisms, human bodies  (including their brains) are factories for transforming  anything into  anything  that the laws of nature allow. They are ‘universal constructors’. This universality in the human condition is part of a broader phe  - nomenon that I shall discuss in Chapter 6. We do not share it with any  other species currently on Earth. But, since it is a consequence of the  ability to create explanations, we do necessarily share it with any other  people that might exist in the universe. The opportunities provided by  the laws of nature for transforming resources are universal, and all  entities with universal reach necessarily have the same reach.  A few species other than humans are known to be capable of having  cultural knowledge. For example, some apes can discover new methods  of cracking nuts, and pass that knowledge on to other apes. As I shall  discuss in Chapter 16, the existence of such knowledge is suggestive  of how ape-like species evolved into people. But it is irrelevant to the  arguments of this chapter, because no such organism is capable of  creating or using explanatory knowledge. Hence the cultural knowledge  of such organisms is of essentially the same type as genetic knowledge,  and does indeed have only a small and inherently limited reach. They  are not universal constructors, but highly specialized ones. For them,  the Haldane–Dawkins argument is valid: the world is stranger than  they can conceive. In some environments in the universe, the most efficient way for  humans to thrive might be to alter their own genes. Indeed, we are already  doing that in our present environment, to eliminate diseases that have  in the past blighted many lives. Some people object to this on the grounds  (in effect) that a genetically altered human is no longer human. This is  an anthropomorphic mistake. The only uniquely signifi  cant thing about======================================================== the other and to make it run towards  or away from it respectively, while other genes evolve to make their  organism hard to recognize against the relevant background. That is  why tigers are striped.  Occasionally it happens by chance that the parochial criteria of  attractiveness that evolved within a species produce something that  looks beautiful to us: the peacock’s tail is an example. But that is a    rare anomaly: in the overwhelming majority of species, we do not share  any of their criteria for finding something attractive. Yet with flowers  – most flowers – we do. Sometimes a leaf can be beautiful; even a  puddle of water can. But, again, only by rare chance. With flowers it  is reliable.  It is another regularity in nature. What is the explanation? Why are  flowers beautiful? Given the prevailing assumptions in the scientific community – which  are still rather empiricist and reductionist – it may seem plausible that  flowers are not objectively beautiful, and that their attractiveness is  merely a cultural phenomenon. But I think that that fails closer inspec- tion. We find flowers beautiful that we have never seen before, and  which have not been known to our culture before – and quite reliably,  for most humans in most cultures. The same is not true of the  roots   of plants, or the leaves. Why only the flowers? One unusual aspect of the flower–insect co-evolution is that it  involved the creation of a complex code, or language, for signalling  information between  species . It had to be complex because the genes  were facing a difficult communication problem. The code had to be,  on the one hand, easily recognizable by the right insects, and, on the  other, difficult to forge by other species of flower – for if other species  could cause their pollen to be spread by the same insects without having  to manufacture nectar for them, which requires energy, they would  have a selective advantage. So the criterion that was evolving in the  insects had to be discriminating enough to pick the right flowers and  not crude imitations; and the flowers’ design had to be such that no  design that other flower species could easily evolve could be mistaken  for it. Thus both the criterion and the means of meeting it had to be  hard to vary. 362 the beginning of infinity When genes are facing a similar problem  within  a species, notably  in the co-evolution of criteria and characteristics for choosing mates,  they already have a large amount of shared genetic knowledge to draw  on. For instance, even before any such co-evolution begins, the genome  may already contain adaptations for recognizing fellow members of  the species, and for detecting various attributes of them. Moreover, the  attributes that a mate is searching for may initially be objectively useful  ones – such as neck length in a giraffe. One theory of the evolution of  giraffe necks is that it began as an adaptation for feeding, but then  continued through sexual selection. However, there is no such shared  knowledge to build on across the gap between distant species. They  are starting from scratch. And therefore my guess is that the easiest way to signal across such  a gap with hard-to-forge patterns designed to be recognized by hard- to-emulate pattern-matching algorithms is to use  objective  standards  of beauty. So flowers have to create objective beauty, and insects have  to recognize objective beauty. Consequently the only species that are  attracted by flowers are the insect species that co-evolved to do so –  and humans.  If true, this means that Dawkins’ daughter was partly right about  the flowers after all. They  are  there to make the world pretty; or, at  least, prettiness is no accidental side effect but is what they specifically  evolved to have. Not because anything intended the world to be pretty,  but because the best-replicating genes depend on embodying  objective  prettiness  to get themselves replicated. The case of honey, for instance,  is very different. The reason that honey – which is sugar water – is easy  for flowers and bees to make, and why its taste is attractive to humans  and insects alike, is that we  do  all have a shared genetic heritage going  back to our common ancestor and before, which includes biochemical  knowledge about many uses of sugar, and the means to recognize it. Could it be that what humans find attractive in flowers – or in art  – is indeed objective, but it is not objective  beauty ? Perhaps it is  something more mundane – something like a liking for bright colours,  strong contrasts, symmetrical shapes. Humans seem to have an inborn  liking for symmetry. It is thought to be a factor in sexual attractiveness,  and it may also be useful in helping us to classify things and to organize  our environment physically and conceptually. So a side effect of these  363 Why are Flowers Beautiful?  inborn preferences might be a liking for flowers, which happen to be  colourful and symmetrical.======================================================== david deutsch The Beginning of Infinity Explanations that Transform the World VIKING The Beginning of Infinity david deutsch The Beginning of Infinity Explanations that Transform the World VIKING VIKING Published by the Penguin Group Penguin Group (USA) Inc., 375 Hudson Street, New York, New York 10014, U.S.A.

It began at approximately the time of the  scientific revolution, and is still under way. It has included improve- ments not only in scientific understanding, but also in technology,  political institutions, moral values, art, and every aspect of human  welfare. Whenever there has been progress, there have been influential  thinkers who denied that it was genuine, that it was desirable, or even  that the concept was meaningful. They should have known better. There  is indeed an objective difference between a false explanation and a    true one, between chronic failure to solve a problem and solving it,  and also between wrong and right, ugly and beautiful, suffering    and its======================================================== would have been the last gasp of reason in the field. I doubt that either Lagrange or Michelson thought of himself as  pessimistic. Yet their prophecies entailed the dismal decree that  no  matter what you do, you will understand no further . It so happens that  both of them had made discoveries which could have led them to the  very progress whose possibility they denied. They should have been  seeking that progress, should they not? But almost no one is creative  in fields in which they are pessimistic. I remarked at the end of Chapter 13 that the desirable future is one  where we progress from misconception to ever better (less mistaken)  misconception. I have often thought that the nature of science would  be better understood if we called theories ‘misconceptions’ from the  outset, instead of only after we have discovered their successors. Thus  we could say that Einstein’s Misconception of Gravity was an improve- ment on Newton’s Misconception, which was an improvement on  Kepler’s. The neo-Darwinian Misconception of Evolution is an im    - provement on Darwin’s Misconception, and his on Lamarck’s. If people  thought of it like that, perhaps no one would need to be reminded that  science claims neither infallibility nor finality.  Perhaps a more practical way of stressing the same truth would be to  frame the growth of knowledge (all knowledge, not only scientific) as a  continual transition from  problems  to  better problems , rather than from  447 The Beginning problems to solutions or from theories to better theories .  This is the  positive conception of ‘problems’ that I stressed in Chapter 1. Thanks  to Einstein’s discoveries, our current problems in physics embody more  knowledge than Einstein’s own problems did. His prob  lems were rooted  in the discoveries of Newton and Euclid, while most problems that  preoccupy physicists today are rooted in – and would be inaccessible  mysteries without – the discoveries of twentieth-century physics.  The same is true in mathematics. Although mathematical theorems  are rarely proved  false  once they have been around for a while, what  does happen is that mathematicians’ understanding of what is fund- amental improves. Abstractions that were originally studied in their  own right are understood as aspects of more general abstractions, or  are related in unforeseen ways to other abstractions. And so progress  in mathematics also goes from problems to better problems, as does  progress in all other fields.  Optimism and reason are incompatible with the conceit that our  knowledge is ‘nearly there’ in any sense, or that its foundations are.  Yet comprehensive optimism has always been rare, and the lure of    the prophetic fallacy strong. But there have always been exceptions.  Socrates famously claimed to be deeply ignorant. And Popper wrote: I believe that it would be worth trying to learn something about the   world even if in trying to do so we should merely learn that we do not  know much . . . It might be well for all of us to remember that, while  differing widely in the various little bits we know, in our infinite ignorance  we are all equal. Conjectures and Refutations  (1963) Infinite ignorance is a necessary condition for there to be infinite  potential for knowledge. Rejecting the idea that we are ‘nearly there’  is a necessary condition for the avoidance of dogmatism, stagnation  and tyranny. In 1996 the journalist John Horgan caused something of a stir with  his book  The End of Science :  Facing the Limits of Knowledge in the  Twilight of the Scientific Age . In it, he argued that the final truth in all  fundamental areas of science – or at least as much of it as human minds  would ever be capable of grasping – had already been discovered during  the twentieth century. 448 the beginning of infinity Horgan wrote that he had originally believed science to be ‘open- ended, even infinite’. But he became convinced of the contrary by (what  I would call) a series of misconceptions and bad arguments. His basic  misconception was empiricism. He believed that what distinguishes  science from unscientific fields such as literary criticism, philosophy or  art is that science has the ability to ‘resolve questions’ objectively (by  comparing theories with reality), while other fields can produce only  multiple, mutually incompatible interpretations of any issue. He was  mistaken in both respects. As I have explained throughout this book,  there is objective truth to be found in all those fields, while finality or  infallibility cannot be found anywhere. Horgan accepts from the bad philosophy of ‘postmodern’ literary  criticism its wilful confusion between two kinds of ‘ambiguity’ that  can exist in philosophy and art. The first is the ‘ambiguity’ of multiple  true meanings, either intended by the author or existing because of the  reach of the ideas. The second is the ambiguity of deliberate vagueness,  confusion, equivocation or self-contradiction.

Suppose that you are a guest at the hotel. A book – gift-wrapped in  opaque paper – appears in your room’s delivery chute. You are hoping  that it will be the newer book, because you have already read the old  one. You are fairly confident that it  will  be, because, after all, what are  the chances that your room is one of those that receive the old book?  Exactly one in a million, it seems. But, before you have a chance to open the package, there is an  announcement. Everyone is to change rooms, to a number designated  on a card that will come through the chute. The announcement also  mentions that the new allocation will move all the recipients of one of  the books to odd-numbered rooms, and the recipients of the other  book to even-numbered ones, but it does not say which is which. So  you cannot tell, from your new room number, which book you have  received. Of course there is no problem with filling the rooms in this  manner: both books had infinitely many recipients. 1   2   4   3   6   8   5   10   12   7   14   16   … 177 A Window on Infinity Your card arrives and you move to your new room. Are you    now any less sure about which of the two books you have received?  Presumably not. By your previous reasoning, there is now only a one  in  two  chance that your book is  The Beginning of Infinity , because it  is now in ‘half the rooms’. Since that is a contradiction, your method  of assessing those probabilities must have been wrong. Indeed, all  methods of assessing them are wrong, because – as this example shows  – in Infinity Hotel there is  no such thing  as the probability that you  have received the one book or the other. Mathematically, this is nothing momentous. The example merely  demonstrates again that the attributes probable or improbable, rare  or common, typical or untypical have literally no meaning in regard  to comparing infinite sets of natural numbers.  But, when we turn to physics, it is bad news for anthropic arguments.  Imagine an infinite set of  universes , all with the same laws of physics  except that one particular physical constant, let us call it  D , has a  different value in each. (Strictly speaking, we should imagine an  un    - countable  infinity of universes, like those infinitely thin cards – but that  only makes the problem I am about to describe worse, so let us keep  things simple.) Assume that, of these universes, infinitely many have  values of  D  that produce astrophysicists, and infinitely many have  values that do not. Then let us number the universes in such a way that  all those with astrophysicists have even numbers and all the ones  without astrophysicists have odd numbers.  This does not mean that half the universes have astrophysicists. Just  as with the book distribution in Infinity Hotel, we could equally well  label the universes so that only every third universe, or every trillionth  one, had astrophysicists, or so that every trillionth one did not. So there  is something wrong with the anthropic explanation of the fine-tuning  problem: we can make the fine-tuning go away just by relabelling the  universes. At our whim, we can number them in such a way that  astrophysicists seem to be the rule, or the exception, or anything in  between.  Now, suppose that we calculate, using the relevant laws of physics  with different values of  D , whether astrophysicists will emerge. We  find that for values of  D  outside the range from, say, 137 to 138, those  that contain astrophysicists are very sparse: only one in a trillion such  178 the beginning of infinity universes has astrophysicists. Within the range, only one in a trillion  does  not  have astrophysicists, and for values of  D  between 137.4  and 137.6 they all do.  Let me stress that in real life we do not  understand the process of astrophysicist-formation remotely well  enough to calculate such numbers – and perhaps we never shall, as I  shall explain in the next chapter. But, whether we could calculate them  or not, anthropic theorists would wish to interpret such numbers as  meaning that, if we measure  D , we are  unlikely  to see values outside  the range from 137 to 138. But they mean no such thing. For we could  just relabel the universes (shuffle the infinite pack of ‘cards’) to make  the spacings exactly the other way round – or anything else we liked.  Scientific explanations cannot possibly depend on how we choose  to label the entities referred to in the theory. So anthropic reasoning,  by itself, cannot make predictions. Which is why I said in Chapter 4  that it cannot explain the fine-tuning of the constants of physics.  The physicist Lee Smolin has proposed an ingenious variant of the  anthropic explanation. It relies on the fact that, according to some  theories of quantum gravity, it is possible for a black hole to spawn  an entire new universe inside itself. Smolin supposes======================================================== organism must also have created the knowledge of how that  organism works. Creationism thus faces an inherent dilemma: is the  designer a purely supernatural being – one who was ‘just there’, com  - plete with all that knowledge – or not? A being who was ‘just there’  would serve no explanatory purpose (in regard to the biosphere), since  then one could more economically say that the biosphere itself ‘just  happened’, complete with that same knowledge, embodied in organisms.  On the other hand, to whatever extent a creationist theory provides  explanations about how supernatural beings designed and created the  biosphere, they are no longer supernatural beings but merely unseen  ones. They might, for instance, be an extraterrestrial civilization. But  then the theory is not really creationism – unless it proposes that    80 the beginning of infinity the extraterrestrial designers themselves had supernatural designers.  Moreover, the designer of any adaptation must by definition have  had the  intention  that the adaptation be as it is. But that is hard to  reconcile with the designer envisaged in virtually all creationist theories,  namely a deity or deities worthy of worship; for the reality is that many  biological adaptations have distinctly suboptimal features. For instance,  the eyes of vertebrates have their ‘wiring’ and blood supply  in front  of  the retina, where they absorb and scatter incoming light and so degrade  the image. There is also a blind spot where the optic nerve passes  through the retina on its way to the brain. The eyes of some inverte- brates, such as squids, have the same basic design but without those  design flaws. The effect of the flaws on the efficiency of the eye is small;  but the point is that they are wholly contrary to the eye’s functional  purpose, and so conflict with the idea that that purpose was intended  by a divine designer. As Charles Darwin put it in  The Origin of Species ,  ‘On the view of each organism with all its separate parts having been  specially created, how utterly inexplicable is it that organs bearing the  plain stamp of inutility . . . should so frequently occur.’ There are even examples of  non -functional design. For instance,  most animals have a gene for synthesizing vitamin C, but in primates,  including humans, though that gene is recognizably present ,  it is faulty:  it does not do anything. This is very difficult to account for except as  a vestigial feature that primates have inherited from non-primate  ancestors. One could retreat to the position that all these apparently  poor design features do have some undiscovered purpose. But that is  a bad explanation: it could be used to claim that  any  poorly designed  or undesigned entity was perfectly designed. Another assumed characteristic of the designer according to most  religions is benevolence. But, as I mentioned in Chapter 3, the biosphere  is much less pleasant for its inhabitants than anything that a benevolent,  or even halfway decent, human designer would design. In theological  contexts this is known as ‘the problem of suffering’ or ‘the problem of  evil’, and is frequently used as an argument against the existence of  God. But in that role it is easily brushed off. Typical defences are that  perhaps morality is different for a supernatural being; or perhaps we  are too limited intellectually to be able to understand how moral the  biosphere really is. However, here I am concerned not with whether  81 Creation God exists, only with how to explain biological adaptations, and in  that regard those defences of creationism have the same fatal flaw as  the Haldane–Dawkins argument (Chapter 3): a world that is ‘queerer  than we  can  suppose’ is indistinguishable from a world ‘tricked out  with magic’. So all such explanations are bad.  The central flaw of creationism – that its account of how the know- ledge in adaptations could possibly be created is either missing, super- natural or illogical – is also the central flaw of pre-Enlightenment,  authoritative conceptions of  human  knowledge. In some versions it is  literally the same theory, with certain types of knowledge (such as  cosmology or moral knowledge and other rules of behaviour) being  spoken to early humans by supernatural beings. In others, parochial  features of society (such as the existence of monarchs in govern-  ment, or indeed the existence of God in the universe) are protected by  taboos or taken so uncritically for granted that they are not even  recognized as ideas. And I shall discuss the  evolution  of such ideas and  institutions in Chapter 15. The prospect of the unlimited creation of knowledge in the future  conflicts with creationism by undercutting its motivation. For eventu- ally, with the assistance of what we would consider stupendously  powerful computers, any child will be capable of designing and im    - plementing a better, more complex, more beautiful, and also far more  moral biosphere than the======================================================== pen, and later crossed one out for each goat that returned, then one  would have retrieved all the goats when one had crossed out all the  marks.  That is a universal system of tallying. But, like levels of emergence,  there is a hierarchy of universality. The next level above tallying is  counting, which involves numerals. When tallying goats one is merely  thinking ‘another, and another, and another’; but when counting them  one is thinking ‘forty, forty-one, forty-two . . . ’  It is only with hindsight that we can regard tally marks as a system  of numerals, known as the ‘unary’ system. As such, it is an impractical  system. For instance, even the simplest operations on numbers rep  - resented by tally marks, such as comparing them, doing arithmetic,  and even just copying them, involves repeating the entire tallying  process. If you had forty goats, and sold twenty, and had tally-mark  records of both those numbers, you would still have to perform twenty  individual deletion operations to bring your record up to date. Similarly,  checking whether two fairly close numerals were the same would  involve tallying them against each other. So people began to improve  the system. The earliest improvement may have been simply to group  the tally marks – for instance, writing  ⎥⎥⎥⎥ ⎥⎥⎥⎥   instead of  ⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥ .  This made arithmetic and comparison easier, since one could tally  whole groups and see at a glance that  ⎥⎥⎥⎥   ⎥⎥⎥⎥   is different from ⎥⎥⎥⎥    ⎥⎥⎥⎥ ⎥ .   Later, such groups were themselves represented by shorthand  symbols: the ancient Roman system used symbols like   ,   ,   ,   ,   ,   , and    to represent one, five, ten, fifty, one hundred, five hundred,  and one thousand. (So they were not quite the same as the ‘Roman  numerals’ we use today.) So this was another story of incremental improvements intended to  solve specific, parochial problems. And, again, it seems that no one  aspired to anything more. Even though adding simple rules could make  129 The Jump to Universality the system much more powerful, and even though the Romans did  occasionally add some such rules, they did this without ever aiming  for, or achieving, universality. For some centuries, the rules of their  system were:  – Placing symbols side by side means adding them together. (This rule  was inherited from the tally-mark system.) – Symbols must be written in order of decreasing value from left to  right; and  –  Adjacent symbols must be replaced by the symbol for their combined  value whenever possible.  (The subtractive rule in today’s ‘Roman numerals’, where    represents  four, was introduced later.) The second and third rules ensure that each  number has only one representation, which makes comparison much  easier. Without them,    and    would both be  valid numerals, and one could not tell at a glance that they represent  the same number. By exploiting the universal laws of addition, those rules gave the  system some important reach beyond tallying – such as the ability to  perform arithmetic. For example, consider the numbers seven (  ) and  eight (  ). The rules say that placing them side by side –    – is the  same as adding them. Then they tell us to rearrange the symbols in  order of decreasing value:   . Then they tell us to replace the two   ’s by   , and the five   ’s by   . The result is   , which is the representation  of fifteen. Something new has happened here, which is more than just  a matter of shorthand: an abstract truth has been discovered, and  proved, about seven, eight and fifteen without anyone having counted  or tallied anything. Numbers have been manipulated in their own right,  via their numerals.  I mean it literally when I say that it was the  system of numerals  that  performed arithmetic. The human users of the system did of course  physically enact those transformations. But to do that, they first had  to encode the system’s rules somewhere in their brains, and then they  had to execute them as a computer executes its program. And it is the  program that instructs its computer what to do, not vice versa. Hence  the process that we call ‘using Roman numerals to do arithmetic’ also  consists of the Roman-numeral system using  us  to do arithmetic.  130 the beginning of infinity It was only by causing people to do this that the Roman-numeral  system survived – that is to say, caused itself to be copied from  generation to generation of Romans: they found it useful, so they  passed it on to their offspring. As I have said, knowledge is information  which, when it is physically embodied in a suitable environment, tends  to cause itself to remain so. To speak of the Roman-numeral system as controlling us in order  to get itself replicated and preserved may sound like relegating humans  to the status of slaves. But that would be a misconception. People  consist  of abstract information, including the distinctive ideas, theories,======================================================== (sending a  message of one’s choice to the other history).  In our story, just as we did not allow splitting to happen in a way  that would allow communication faster than light, so we must ensure  the same for interference. The simplest way is to require that the  rejoining take place only if no wave of differentiation has happened.  That is to say, the transporter can undo the voltage surge only if this  has not yet caused any differential effects on anything else. When a  X X Y X යය 284 the beginning of infinity wave of differentiation, set off by two different values  X  and  Y  of  some variable, has left an object, the object is  entangled  with all the  differentially affected objects.  Entanglement So our rule, in short, is that interference can happen only in objects  that are unentangled with the rest of the world. This is why, in the  interference experiment, the two applications of the transporter have  to be ‘in quick succession’. (Alternatively, the object in question has to  be sufficiently well isolated for its voltages not to affect its surround- ings.) So we can represent a generic interference experiment symbolically  as follows: If an object is unentangled, it can be made to undergo interference by something  acting on it alone. (The arrows ‘  ’ and ‘  ’ represent the action of the transporter.) Once  the object is entangled with the rest of the world in regard to the values  X  and  Y , no operation on the object alone can create interference  between those values. Instead, the histories are merely split further, in  the usual way: X Y Affected by  X Not differentially affected by  X  and  Y Object not entangled entangled Rest of world Object Rest of world Affected (differently) by  Y X Y ൺ Rest of world Object X Not differentially affected by  X  and  Y Object interference splitting Rest of world X Y Not differentially affected by  X  and  Y X ය ර 285 The Multiverse In entangled objects, further splitting happens instead of interference. When two or more values of a physical variable have differently  affected something in the rest of the world, knock-on effects typically  continue indefinitely, as I have described, with a wave of differentiation  entangling more and more objects. If the differential effects can all be  undone, then interference between those original values becomes  possible again; but the laws of quantum mechanics dictate that undoing  them requires fine control of  all  the affected objects, and that rapidly  becomes infeasible. The process of its becoming infeasible is known as  decoherence . In most situations, decoherence is very rapid, which is  why splitting typically predominates over interference, and why  interference – though ubiquitous on microscopic scales – is quite hard  to demonstrate unambiguously in the laboratory. Nevertheless, it can be done, and quantum interference phenomena  constitute our main evidence of the existence of the multiverse, and of  what its laws are. A real-life analogue of the above experiment is  standard in quantum optics laboratories. Instead of experimenting on  voltmeters (whose many interactions with their environment quickly  cause decoherence), one uses individual photons, and the variable being  acted upon is not voltage but which of two possible paths the photon  is on. Instead of the transporter, one uses a simple device called a semi- silvered mirror (represented by the grey sloping bars in the diagrams  below). When a photon strikes such a mirror, it bounces off in half the  universes, and passes straight through in the other half, as shown on  next page: no interference, entanglement Unaffected Object X Not differentially affected by  X  and  Y Object splitting Rest of world Rest of world X Y Rest of world X Y Affected by  X just splitting Object Rest of world Affected (differently) by  Y X Y Affected by  X Affected (differently) by  Y Y X ය ර ൺ 286 the beginning of infinity Semi-silvered mirror The attributes of travelling in the  X  or  Y  directions behave  analogously to the two voltages  X  and  Y  in our fictitious multiverse.  So passing through the semi-silvered mirror is the analogue of the  transformation        above. And when the two instances of a single  photon, travelling in directions  X  and  Y , strike the second semi-silvered  mirror at the same time, they undergo the transformation     , which  means that both instances emerge in the direction  X :   the two histories  rejoin. To demonstrate this, one can use a set-up known as a ‘Mach– Zehnder interferometer’, which performs those two transfor    mations  (splitting and interference) in quick succession: Mach–Zehnder interferometer 287 The Multiverse The two ordinary mirrors (the black sloping bars) are merely there to  steer the photon from the first to the second semi-silvered mirror. If a photon is introduced travelling rightwards ( X )  after  the  first mirror instead of before as shown, then it appears to emerge  randomly, rightwards or======================================================== alleviation – and thus between stagnation and progress in the  fullest sense. In this book I argue that all progress, both theoretical and practical,  has resulted from a single human activity: the quest for what I call  good explanations. Though this quest is uniquely human, its effective- ness is also a fundamental fact about reality at the most impersonal,  cosmic level – namely that it conforms to universal laws of nature that  are indeed good explanations. This simple relationship between the  cosmic and the human is a hint of a central role of  people  in the cosmic  scheme of things. Must progress come to an end – either in catastrophe or in some  sort of completion – or is it unbounded? The answer is the latter. That  unboundedness is the ‘infinity’ referred to in the title of this book.  Explaining it, and the conditions under which progress can and cannot  happen, entails a journey through virtually every fundamental field of  science and philosophy. From each such field we learn that, although  progress has no necessary end, it does have a necessary beginning: a  cause, or an event with which it starts, or a necessary condition for it  to take off and to thrive. Each of these beginnings is ‘the beginning of  infinity’ as viewed from the perspective of that field. Many seem,  superficially, to be unconnected. But they are all facets of a single  attribute of reality, which I call  the  beginning of infinity. introduction 1 1 The Reach of Explanations Behind it all is surely an idea so simple, so beautiful, that when  we grasp it – in a decade, a century, or a millennium – we will  all say to each other, how could it have been otherwise? John Archibald Wheeler,  Annals of the  New York Academy of Sciences , 480 (1986) To unaided human eyes, the universe beyond our solar system looks  like a few thousand glowing dots in the night sky, plus the faint, hazy  streaks of the Milky Way. But if you ask an astronomer what is out  there in reality, you will be told not about dots or streaks, but about  stars : spheres of incandescent gas millions of kilometres in diameter  and light years away from us. You will be told that the sun is a typical  star, and looks different from the others only because we are much  closer to it – though still some 150 million kilometres away. Yet, even  at those unimaginable distances, we are confident that we know what  makes stars shine: you will be told that they are powered by the nuclear  energy released by  transmutation  – the conversion of one chemical  element into another (mainly hydrogen into helium).  Some types of transmutation happen spontaneously on Earth, in the  decay of radioactive elements. This was first demonstrated in 1901, by  the physicists Frederick Soddy and Ernest Rutherford, but the concept  of transmutation was ancient. Alchemists had dreamed for centuries  of transmuting ‘base metals’, such as iron or lead, into gold. They never  came close to understanding what it would take to achieve that, so  they never did so. But scientists in the twentieth century did. And so  do stars, when they explode as supernovae. Base metals can be  2 the beginning of infinity transmuted into gold by stars, and by intelligent beings who understand  the processes that power stars, but by nothing else in the universe. As for the Milky Way, you will be told that, despite its insubstantial  appearance, it is the most massive object that we can see with the naked  eye: a  galaxy  that includes stars by the hundreds of billions, bound by  their mutual gravitation across tens of thousands of light years. We  are seeing it from the inside, because we are part of it. You will be told  that, although our night sky appears serene and largely changeless, the  universe is seething with violent activity. Even a typical star converts  millions of tonnes of mass into energy every second, with each  gram   releasing as much energy as an atom bomb. You will be told that within  the range of our best telescopes, which can see more galaxies than  there are stars in our galaxy, there are several supernova explosions  per second, each briefly brighter than all the other stars in its galaxy  put together. We do not know where life and intelligence exist, if at  all, outside our solar system, so we do not know how many of those  explosions are horrendous tragedies. But we do know that a supernova  devastates all the planets that may be orbiting it, wiping out all life  that may exist there – including any intelligent beings, unless they have  technology far superior to ours. Its neutrino radiation alone would kill  a human at a range of billions of kilometres, even if that entire distance  were filled with lead shielding. Yet we owe our existence to supernovae:  they are the source, through transmutation, of most of the elements  of which our bodies, and our planet, are composed.  There are phenomena that outshine supernovae. In March 2008 an  X-ray telescope in Earth orbit detected an======================================================== nation merely has one more legislator to feed than planned.  The real problem is that this apportionment is no longer representative:  85 per cent of eleven is not 8.5 but 9.35. So the large state, with only  eight seats, is in fact short of its quota by well over one seat. My rule  under-represents 85 per cent of the population. Because we  intended   to allocate ten seats, the exact quotas necessarily add up to ten; but  the rounded ones add up to eleven. And if there are going to be eleven  seats in the House, the principle of representative government – and  the Constitution – requires each state to receive its fair share of those,  not of the ten that we merely intended.  Again, many ‘why don’t they just . . . ?’ ideas spring to mind. Why  don’t they just create three additional seats and give them to the large  state, thus bringing the allocation within the quota? (Curious readers  328 the beginning of infinity may check that no fewer than three additional seats are needed to  achieve this.) Alternatively, why don’t they just transfer a seat from  one of the small states to the large state? Perhaps it should be from the  state with the smallest population, so as to disadvantage as few people  as possible. That would not only bring all the allocations within the  quota, but also restore the number of seats to the originally intended  ten. Such strategies are known as  reallocation schemes . They are indeed  capable of staying within the quota. So, what is wrong with them? In  the jargon of the subject, the answer is  apportionment paradoxes  – or,  in ordinary language,  unfairness  and  irrationality .  For example, the last reallocation scheme that I described is unfair  by being biased against the inhabitants of the least populous state.  They bear the whole cost of correcting the rounding errors. On this  occasion their representation has been rounded down to zero. Yet, in  the sense of minimizing the deviation from the quotas, the apportion- ment is almost perfectly fair: previously, 85 per cent of the population  were well outside the quota, and now all are within it and 95 per cent  are at the closest whole numbers to their quotas. It is true that 5 per  cent now have no representatives – so they will not be able to vote in  congressional elections at all – but that still leaves them within the  quota, and indeed only slightly further from their exact quota than  they were. (The numbers zero and one are almost equidistant from the  quota of just over one half.) Nevertheless, because those 5 per cent  have been completely disenfranchised, most advocates of representative  government would regard this outcome as much less representative  than it was before.  That must mean that the ‘minimum total deviation from quota’ is  not the right measure of representativeness. But what is the right  measure? What is the right trade-off between being slightly unfair to  many people and very unfair to a few people? The Founding Fathers  were aware that different conceptions of fairness, or representativeness,  could conflict. For example, one of their justifications for democracy  was that govern  ment was not legitimate unless everyone who was  subject to the law had a representative, of equal power, among the  lawmakers. This was expressed in their slogan ‘No taxation without  representation’. Another of their aspirations was to abolish  privilege :  329 Choices they wanted the system of government to have no built-in bias. Hence  the requirement of proportional allocation. Since these two aspirations  can conflict, the Constitution contains a clause that explicitly adjudicates  between them: ‘Each State shall have at least one Representative.’ This  favours the principle of representative government in the no-taxation- without-representation sense over the same principle in the abolish- privilege sense. Another concept that frequently appeared in the Founding Fathers’  arguments for representative government was ‘the will of the people’.  Governments are supposed to enact it. But that is a source of further  inconsistencies. For in elections, only the will of  voters  counts, and not  all of ‘the people’ are voters. At the time, voters were a fairly small  minority: only free male citizens over the age of twenty-one. To address  this point, the ‘Numbers’ referred to in the Constitution constituted  the whole population of a state, including non-voters such as women,  children, immigrants and slaves. In this way the Constitution attempted  to treat the  population  equally by treating  voters  unequally. So voters in states with a higher proportion of non-voters were  allocated more representatives per capita.  This had the perverse effect  that in the states where the voters were already the most privileged  within  the state (i.e. where they were an exceptionally small minority),  they now received an additional privilege relative to voters in other  states: they were allocated more representation in
