======================================================== ditchdigg ers  working with  their  hands.  A  slight  variation  in  the  amount  of  soil  moved  per  hour  is barely  p erceptible.  Y our  work  is  indistinguishable  from  that  of  the  person next to you. The only way to move more dirt is to dig for longer . W ithin this paradigm,  the  ditchdigger  who  takes  a  week  of f  to  experiment  and  invent the  shov el  seems  crazy .  Not  only  do  they  look  like  a  fool  for  taking  a  risk, but  thei r  cumulative  production   falls  behind  for  every  day  they  are  not digging.  Only  when  the  shovel  comes  along  do  others  see  its  advantage. Success requires shamelessness. So too does failure. Doing  somethin g  dif ferent  means  you  might  underperform,  but  it  also means you might change the game entirely . If  y ou  do  what   everyone  else  does,  you’ll  get  the  same  res ults  that everyone  else  gets. [*]   Best  practices  aren’ t  always  the  best.  By  definition, they’re average. If  you  don’ t  know  enough  about  what  you’re  doing  to  make  your  own decisions,  you  probably  should  do  what  everyone  is  doing.  I f  you  want better -than-average  results,  though,  you’ll  have  to  think  clearly .  And thinking  clearly  is  thinking  independently .  Sometimes  you  have  to  break free  of  the  social  default  and  do  something  dif ferently  from  th ose  around you. Fair warning: it’ s going to get uncomfortable. Our  des ire  to  fit  in  often  overp owers  our  desire  for  a  better  outcome. Instead of trying something new , we tell ourselves something new . Deviating  from  established  prac tices  can  be  painful.  Who  wan ts  to  try something  dif ferent  that  might  not  work?  W e  could  end  up  losing  people’ s respect,  their  friendship,  and  even  our  job  if  we  deviate  too  f ar  from  the status  qu o  witho ut  producing  the  right  results.  This  is  why  we  rarely  try new  ap proaches,  and  when  we  do,  we  often  proceed  with  so  much trepidation  that  the  smallest  setb ack  sends  us  back  to  the  safety  blanket  of conformity . It’ s  easy  to  take  comfort  in  the  fact  that  other  people  agree  wit h  us.  As legendary  investor  W arren  Buf fett  pointed  out,  though,  “The  fact  that  other people  agree  or  disagree  with  you  makes  you  neither  right  nor  wrong.  Y ou will be right if your facts and reasoning are correct.” The  peo ple  executing  establishe d  practices  say  they  want  new  ideas,  but they  just  don’ t  want  the  bad  ones.  And  because  they  so  want  to  avoid  the bad ones, they never deviate enough to find new good ones. While  we  need  diver gence  from  the  norm  to  make  progress ,  not  all diver gence  is  advantageous.  T o  be  successful,  it’ s  not  eno ugh  to  do something  dif ferent;  you  also  need  to  be  right.  T o  do  something  dif ferent, you need to think dif ferent. And that means you will stand out. [*] Lou  Brock  might  have  put  it  best  when  he  said,  “Show  me  a  guy  who’ s afraid  to  look  b ad,  and  I’ll  sho w  you  a  guy  you  can  beat  every  time.”  In other  w ords,  someone  who’ s  possessed  by  the  social  default  is  easy  to defeat. W arren  Buf fett  similarly  highlig hted  the  ef fects  of  the  social  default  in his 1984 letter to Berkshire Hathaway’ s shareholders: Most  ma nagers  have  very  little  incentive  to  make  the  intelligen t-but- with-some-chance-of-looking-like-an-idiot  decision.  Their  per sonal gain/loss  ratio  is  all  too  obvious:   if  an  unconventional  decision  works out  w ell,  they  g et  a  pat  on  the  back  and,  if  it  works  out  poorly ,   they get  a  pink  slip.  ( Failing  conventionally  is  the  route  to  go;  as  a  g roup, lemmings  may  have  a  rotten  im age,  but  no  individual  lemming  has ever received bad press.) [4] Lemmings  might  make  small  changes,  sure,  but  not  the  change s  they  need in  order   to  make  an  outsize  impact.  While  they’ll  talk  about  how  they’re doing  great  things  to  change  the   course  of  events,  when  you  dig  beneath  the surface,  things  are  the  same  as  before.  What’ s  really  changed  is  the marketing. Change  happens   only  when  you’re  willing  to  think  independently ,  when you  do  what  nobody  else  is  doin g,  and  risk  looking  like  a  fool  because  of  it. Once  yo u  realize   you’ve  been  do ing  what  everyone  else  is  doing—and  only because they’re already doing it—it’ s time to try something new . Later  I’ll  discuss  more  example s  of  how  the  social  default  operates  and how  to  combat  it.  For  the  time  b eing  keep  the  following  in  mind :  if  you  find yourself  exerting   ener gy  to  fit  in  with  a  crowd,  if  you’re  freque ntly  fearful of  d isappointing   other  people,  if   you’re  afraid  of  being  an  outsider ,  or  if  the threat  of  scorn  fills  you======================================================== requests  from  someone  who  shows they’re  invested  in  solving  a  pr oblem,  and  who  demonstrates  they’ve done  their  research  to  craft  a  pitch  around  a  very  specific  issu e  I  can help  wit h,  I’m  happy  and  eager   to  respond.  Contrast  that  with  emails that  say ,  “Hey  Shane,  what  do  you  think  of  this  investment opportunity?” Which would you be more excited to answer? Get  pr ecise  on  your  ask:   Be  very  clear  what  you’re  looking  for .  Are you  looking  for  them  to  review   your  plan  and  provide  feedback?  Are you  looking  for  them  to  introduce  you  to  people  who  can  solve  the problem? Whatever it is that you want, just be clear . Show  r espect  for  their  time  and  energy:   Explicitly  stating  that  the person  you’re  reaching  out  to  is  an  expert  whose  time  and  ener gy  you respect  goes  a  long  way  to  secure  their  goodwill.  Y ou  shou ld  also demonstrate  your  respect  for  them,  though.  For  instance,  do  not   ask  for fifteen  minutes  to  pick  their  br ain;  instead,  ask  if  they  of fer  one-of f consulting  sessions  and  how  much  they  char ge  for  them.  Experts  are expensive  and  most  of  the  time  for  good  reason.  If  you’re  paying $1,000  to  $2,000  per  hour  for  something,  it  forces  you  to  get  c lear  on what  yo u  want  before  you  hop  on  the  call.  Paying  for  someone ’ s  time not  only   compe nsates  them  for  the  value  they  bring  to  the  ta ble  but forces  y ou  to  make  sure  you’re  not  mumbling  through  the  call  and wasting their time and yours. Ask  for  their  r easons  and  listen:   A s  mentioned  p reviously ,  don’ t   just ask  experts  what  they  think,  as k  them  how  they  think.  Use  them  as  a resource  to  train  yourself  how  to  evaluate  things  so  that  you  can  start embodying  an  expert  way  of  op erating.  Y ou  don’ t  have  to  agree  with what  they’re  saying,  but  remem ber:  your  goal  is  to  learn  from  them how to think better , not to have them solve your problem for you. Follow  up:   If  you  want  to  build  a  network   and  make  this  more  than  a transactional  req uest,  follow  up  to  report  on  your  progress  no   matter what  the   outcom e  is.  Whether  their  advice  helped  you  in  this  case  or not,  foll owing  up  and  keeping  them  updated  on  your  progress  primes them  to help you in the future. When they see that you took their advice seriously , they’re going to want to help you again. Of  c ourse,  most  experts  aren’ t  able  to  respond  to  everyone  who  needs  their help.  It’ s  much  easier  if  you  develop  a  personal  relationship  with  people before  y ou  need   their  help.  Tha t  way  the  request  isn’ t  purely  transactional. It’ s  impossible  to  predict  which   fields  you  might  someday  need  an  expert in,  but  that’ s  one  reason  to  cast  a  wide  net  socially  and  professionally .  I  just looked  at  my  inb ox  last  week  and  had  fifty-three  requests  for  “help”  in  one form  or  another .   T wo  were  from   friends.  I  can’ t  reply  to  them  a ll,  so  where do you think my time will go? Experts vs. Imitators Getting  HiEx  information  requires  that  you  get  help  from  real  experts.  But there are many people who claim to be experts (or whom other people claim to be experts) who really aren’ t. S A F E  G  U A R D :   T ake  time  to  distinguish  real  experts  from  imitators.   N ot  everyone  who claims to be an expert is. T ake the time to know the dif ference. Think  o f  all  the  money  managers  who  borrow  their  talking  points  from W arren  B uf fett.  They  might  sound  like  Buf fett,  but  they  don’ t  know  how  to invest  t he  way  Buf fett  does.  They’re  imitators.  Charlie  Munger  once commented  on  this:  “It’ s  very  hard  to  tell  the  dif ference  between  a  good money manager and someone who just has the patter down.” But  what  if  you’re  not  an  expert  yourself?  How  do  you  tell  the dif ference between an expert and an imitator? Experts  are  usually  enthusiastic  about  their  area  of  expertise.  That’ s  why they’re  good  at  it:  they  spend  even  their  spare  time  mastering  and  refining their  kno wledge  and  skills,  and  it  shows.  Imitators  are  less  concerned  with being  gr eat  and  more  concerned   with  looking  great.  That  concern  makes  it easy for the ego to take over . Here are some things to look for: Imitators  can’t  answer  que stions  at  a  deeper  level.   Specific knowledge  is  earned,  not  learn ed,  so  imitators  don’ t  fully  understand the  ideas  they’re  talking  about. [*]   Their  knowledge  is  shallow .  As  a result,  w hen  you  ask  about  det ails,  or  first  principles  or  nonstandard cases, they don’ t have good answers. Imitators  can’t  adapt  their  vocabulary .   They  can  explain  things using  only  the======================================================== they have  to  achieve   the  best  result .  They  don’ t  hide  behind  other s.  The  best people  rise  to  the  challenge—whatever  it  is.  They  choose  to  live  up  to  their best self-image instead of surrendering to their defaults. One  of  the  most   common  mistakes  people  make  is  bar gaining  with  how the  world  should  work  instead  of  accepting  how  it  does  work.  Anytime  you find  yourself  or  your  colleague s  complaining  “that’ s  not  right,”  or  “that’ s not  fair ,”  or  “it  shouldn’ t  be  that  way ,”  you’re  bar gaining,  not  accepting. Y ou want the world to work in a way that it doesn’ t. Failing  to  accept  how  the  world  really  works  puts  your  time  and  ener gy toward  proving  how  right  you  are.  When  the  desired  results  don’ t materialize,  it’ s  easy  to  blame  circumstances  or  others.  I  call  this  the  wrong side of right. Y ou’re focused on your ego not the outcome. Solutions  appear  when  you  stop  bar gaining  and  start  accepting  the reality  o f  the  situation.  That’ s  because  focusing  on  the  next  move,  rather than  how  you  got  here  in  the  first  place,  opens  you  up  to  a  lot  of possibilities. When you put outcome over ego, you get better results. How Y ou Respond Can Always Make Things Better or W orse Y ou  can’ t  control  everything,  but  you  can  control  your  response,  which makes  circumstances  better  or  worse.  Each  response  has  an  impact  on  the future,  ta king  yo u  either  a  step  closer  to  or  a  step  further  from  th e  outcomes you want and the person you want to be. One  ef fective  question  to  ask  yo urself  before  you  act  is,  “W ill this action make the future easier or harder?” [*]   T his  surprisingl y  simple  question  helps change your perspective on the situation and avoid making things worse. As my  grandfather  (and  many  others)  used  to  say ,  “If  you  find  yourself  in  a hole, the first thing you need to do is stop digging.” One  day  in  my  mid-twenties,  I  found  myself  in  my  mentor ’ s  of fice.  I had  missed  out  on  a  promotion—the  first  one  I’d  been  up  for  and  failed  to get—and I was complaining to him about how unfair it was. “Why  is   this  happening  to  me?”  I  remember  saying.  “Is  someone  trying to  send  me  a  me ssage?”  I  started  talking  trash  about  the  person  w ho’d  made the decision, when my mentor cut me of f. “Y ou’re  refusing   to  accept  som ething  that  already  happened,”   he  said. “And that’ s crazy .” “Crazy?” I replied. “Y es. It’ s already happened. Y ou can’ t ar gue with it.” “Listen,”  he  continued,  “it  really  sucks.  Y ou’re  more  than  qualified.  But you  didn ’ t  get  it,  and  there  is  a  reason  you  didn’ t  get  it.  The  ke y  here  is  to stop blaming others and take ownership.” I  let   his  point  sink  in.  He  was  right.  The  world  didn’ t  just  happen   to  me. It  wasn’ t  out  to  get  me.  I  needed   to  look  inside  myself,  honestly  assess  what I’d contributed to this outcome, and update my way of doing things. As I left my mentor ’ s of fice, the implication was clear . If I couldn’ t learn self-accountability , I wasn’ t going to go very far . Complaining Is Not a Solution Facing  r eality  is  hard.  It’ s  much  easier  to  blame  things  we  have   no  control over than look for our own contributions. T oo  often  we  fight  against  the  feedback  the  world  gives  us,  to  protect our  belie fs.  Rath er  than  changing  ourselves,  we  want  the  world  to  change. And  if  we  don’ t  have  the  power  to  change  it,  we  do  the  only  thing  we  feel we can do: complain. Complaining  isn’ t  productive.  It   only  misleads  you  into  thinking  that  the world  should  function  in  a  way   that  it  doesn’ t.  Distancing  yourself  from reality  makes  it  harder  to  solve  the  problems  you  face.  There  is  always something  you  can  do  today  to  make  the  future  easier ,  though,  and  the moment you stop complaining is the moment you start finding it. Y ou Are Not a V ictim The  mos t  impor tant  story  is  the  one  you  tell  yourself.  While  telling  yourself a  po sitive  story  doesn’ t  ensure  a   good  outcome,  telling  yourself  a  negative story often guarantees a bad one. Each  of   us  is  the  hero  of  the  story  we  tell  ourselves  about  ourselves. Being  at   fault  when  things  go  w rong  doesn’ t  suit  the  hero  status  we  ascribe to  ourselves.  So,  when  it  comes  to  explaining  why  things  went  wrong,  we look for someone else to blame. While  pointing  fingers  when  we  don’ t  get  the  results  we  want  might satisfy  u s  in  the  moment,  it  doesn’ t  give  us  better  judgment,  an d  it  doesn’ t make  us   better  people.  It’ s  instead  a  defensive  reaction  prompted   by  our  ego default—a  reaction  that  keeps  us  nestled  in  the  arms  of  weakness  and======================================================== however ,  that  others  might  see  us  just  as  clea rly  in  kind. When  w e  get  feedback  about  our  own  weaknesses  from  the  world,  it’ s  a rare  opportunity  for  getting  better  and  getting  closer  to  the  kind  of  people we really want to be. Use these opportunities wisely! Blind Spots on the USS  Benfold The  story  of  the  USS   Benfold   p rovides  an  im portant  exampl e  of  how  to recognize and overcome blind spots. [2] The  Benfold   was  one  of  the  worst-performing  warships  in  the  entire  US Navy .   C  ommissioned  in  1996  for  duty  in  the  Pacific  Fleet,  it  housed  one  of the  N avy’ s  most  advanced  arsenals  of  missiles  and  technology  at  the  time. Its  radar  system  was  so  advanced  that  it  could  track  a  bird  from  fifty  miles. Its mission was to be prepared for war at all times. But it was falling short. Despite  otherwise  brilliant  military  careers,  previous  commanders  had been  un able  to  turn  its  performance  around.  So  much  o f  a  ship’ s performance comes down to people, not technology . There’ s  nothing  more  important  for  a  leader  than  getting  the  mo st  out  of your  cr ew .  Often  that  comes  down  to  removing  obstacles  that  limit potential.  All  the  technology  in  the  world  isn’ t  going  to  make  you  better  if the people using it are checked out. The  destiny  of  the  USS  Benfold   cha nged  the  day   Michael  Abrashof f  was named  commander .  He  was  in  h is  mid-thirties  when  the  Navy  of fered  him the  Benfold ,  h is  first  sea  co mmand.  At  the  time,  he  said,  the  “dysfunctiona l ship  had  a  sullen  crew  that  resented  being  there  and  could  not  wait  to  get out  of  the  Navy .”  And  yet,  in  under  twenty  months,  Abrashof f  turned  the Benfold   in to  one  of  the  highest-perform ing  ships  in  the  Navy .  And  he  did  it within a stifling hierarchy . But how? What’ s  incredib le  is  how  he  didn’ t   do  it.  He  didn ’ t  fire  or  dem ote anyone.  He  didn’ t  change  the  h ierarchy .  He  didn’ t  change  any  technology . The  only   real  change  was  within  himself.  He  started  to  identify  h is  potential blind spots, and to look at the world from the crew’ s perspective. Abrashof f  observed  one  of  the  ship’ s  usual  Sunday  afternoon  cookouts shortly  after  assuming  command ,  and  noticed  a  long  line  of  sailors  waiting to  get  their  lunch  while  of ficers  cut  to  the  head  of  the  line  to  get  their  food. Not  only   that,  but  after  getting  th eir  food,  the  of ficers  went  to  a  p rivate  deck to  eat  apart  from  the  sailors.  Im agine  you’re  a  sailor  on  the  ship  and  your boss  comes  and  hops  the  line  in  front  of  you.  What  message  doe s  this  send? Does  it  make  you  want  to  go  all  in  on  your  job?  Does  it  make  you  want  to come up with new ideas to help the ship? “The  of f icers  w eren’ t  bad  people,”  Abrashof f  recalls,  “they  just  didn’ t know  any  dif ferent.  It’ s  always  been  that  way .”  Rather  than  approaching  the of ficers  and  telling  them  what  to  do  (a  typical  command- and-control approach  that  rarely  works  in  the  long  term),  Abrashof f  simply   went  to  the end of the line. A  supply  of ficer  approached  him  and  said,  “Y ou  don’ t  understand.  Y ou go  to  the  head  of  the  line.”  Abrashof f  shrugged  this  of f,  saying  it  didn’ t seem  right  to  hi m.  He  waited  in  line,  got  his  food,  and  then  sat  down  with the  s ailors.  The  next  weekend  everyone  waited  in  line  and  ate  t ogether .  No command was ever issued. From  th e  start,  Abrashof f  knew  you  can’ t  simply  order  peop le  to  be better .  Even  if  that  appears  to  work,  the  results  are  short  term  and  the consequences  en ormous.  It  doesn’ t  matter  if  you’re  on  a  ship  o r  running  a manufacturing  company .  Y ou  don’ t  tap  into  people’ s  resourcefulness, intelligence, and skills by command-and-control. “Show  me  an  o r ganization  in  which  employees  take  ownershi p,  and  I will  show  you  o ne  that  beats  its  competitors,”  says  Abrashof f.  “Captains need  to  see  the  s hip  from  the  cre w’ s  perspective.  They  need  to  m ake  it  easy and rewarding for crew members to express themselves and their ideas.” [3] There  is   a  gap  in   our  thinking  that  comes  from  believing  that  the   way  we see  the  world  is   the  way  the  world  really  works.  It’ s  only  when   we  change our  perspective—when  we  look   at  the  situation  through  the  eyes  of  other people—that  we   realize  what  we’re  missing.  W e  begin  to  ap preciate  our own blind spots and see what we’ve been missing.

The  second  is  about  making good ones. Y ou might think they’re the same, but they are not. Decisions  that  bring  immediate  results ,  like  closing  a  sale  or  filling  a  vacancy , may  be  ef fective,  but  they  don’t  necessarily  lead  to  the  things  that  truly  matter  in life,  like  trust,  love,  and  health.  Good  d ecisions,  on  the  other  hand,  align  with  your long-term  goals  and  values,  and  ultimately  bring  you  the  satisfaction  and  fulfil lment that you truly desire in business, relationships, and life. [*] Ef fective  decisions  get  you  the  first  outcome,  while  good  ones  get  you  the ultimate outcome. All  good  decisions  are  ef fective,  but  not  all  ef fective  decisions  are  good.  Making the  best  judgments  comes  down  to  ma king  decisions  that  get  you  what  you  really want—beyond just what you think you want at the moment. In  life,  we  experience  regret  over  bo th  things  we’ve  done  and  things  we’ve failed  to  do.  The  worst  regret  is  when  we  fail  to  live  a  life  true  to  ourselves,  when we fail to play by our own scoreboard. Each  default  plays  a  role  in  setting  us  up  for  regret.  The  social  default  promp ts us  to  inherit  goals  from  other  people ,  even  if  their  life  circumstances  are  very dif ferent  f rom  ours.  The  inertia  default  encourages  us  to  continue  pursuing  the goals  we’ve  pursued  in  the  past,  even   after  we’ve  come  to  realize  that  achieving them  doesn’t  make  us  happy .  The  em otion  default  sends  us  this  way  and  that, chasing  w hatever  captures  our  fancy  in  the  moment,  even  at  the  expen se  of pursuing  long-term  goals  that  matter  more.  And  the  ego  default  convinces  us  to pursue  things  like  wealth,  status,  and  power ,  even  at  the  expense  of  happiness and well-being—our own and that of the people around us. If  you  give  any  of  the  defaults  command  of  your  life,  your  ultimate  destination  is regret.  Don’t  live  li fe  by  another  pers on’ s  scoreboard.  Don’t  let  someone  else choose  yo ur  objecti ves  in  life.  T ake  responsibility  for  where  you  are  and  where  you are headed. Real  wisdom  doesn’t  come  from  chas ing  success  but  from  building  charact er . As  Jim  Collins  wrote,  “There  is  no  ef fe ctiveness  without  discipline,  and  there  is  no discipline without character .” [1] ⦁ OceanofPDF .com CHAPTER 5.1 D i c k e n s ’ s   H i d d e n   L e s s o n E B E N E Z E R   S  C  R O O  G  E   I S   O N E   O F    C  H A R L E S   D I  C  K E N S ’ S   M O S T   M E M O R A B L E characters—an  embodiment  of  g reed  and  pursuing  wealth  at  the  expense  of everything  else.  Scrooge  is  visited  by  three  spirits  who  show  him  images  of the  p ast,  the  present,  and  a  future  that  might  be.  In  that  future ,  Scrooge  is dead,  and  the  s pirit  allows  him  to  eavesdrop  on  people’ s  co nversations about  h im:  they’re  pleased  Scrooge  is  gone,  spiteful  at  his  memory , unrepentant  abo ut  stealing  his  things,  and  relieved  that  he’ s  no  longer  a presence—a  curse—in  their  lives.  Scrooge  sees  the  long-term  consequences of  the  decisions  he’ s  made,  regre ts  them,  begs  for  a  second  chance,  and  gets an opportunity to change course. [*] Scrooge  played  by  society’ s  scoreboard—the  one  that  amplifies  our biological  instinct  toward  hierarchy  and  leads  us  to  pursue  money ,  status, and  power  at  all  costs.  But  his  vision  of  the  long-term  future   made  him realize  that  none  of  these  things  really  mattered,  that  a  lif e  lived  according to  so meone  else’ s  scoreboard  is  not  a  life  worth  living.  He  realiz ed  before  it was  too   late  that  the  key  to  a  successful  life  is  good  co mpany  and meaningful relationships.

The  moment  we  get  them,  we’re  not  satisfied.  W e  just  want  more. The  psy chologists  Philip  Brickm an  and  Donald  T .  Campbell  coined  a  term for this phenomenon:  the hedonic tr eadmill . [1]  Who hasn’ t taken a run on it? Remember when you were sixteen, and thought that if you just had a car , you’d  be  happy  for  the  rest  of  y our  life?  Then  you  got  a  car .  For  a  week  or two  you   were  euphoric.  Y ou  s howed  the  car  of f  to  all  your  friends  and drove it everywhere. Y ou thought life was amazing. Then reality set in. Cars come  with  problems.  In  add ition  to  paying  for  insurance,  gas,  and maintenance,  the re’ s  also  the  problem  of  comparison.  Back  when  you  didn’ t have  a  car ,  you  used  to  compare  yourself  with  other  people======================================================== hool  or  do  consulting  work  wh ile  she does the job Maria does consulting work: If  it  goes  well:   It  could  lead  to  her  own  bu siness  and  increased flexibility .  The  new  problem  in  this  case  is  figuring  out  how  to   scale  a business. If  i t  goes  poorly:   He r  consulting  opportunities   are  few  and  far between,  and  she  misses  out  on  the  job  of fers.  The  new  problem  in  this case  is  figuring  out  her  next  mo ve.  She’ll  be  in  the  same  position  she’ s in now but with less runway: she’ll have less time to accept an of fer . W e  now   know  what  further  information  Maria  needs  to  gather   to  evaluate this option: Whether  people   are  willing  to  pay  her  for  her  current  knowledge  and skills How much they are willing to pay Maria’ s  example  illustrates  an  important  point  about  second-level  thinking: it  no t  on ly  helps   us  avoid  future   problems,  it  also  uncovers  info rmation  we need  to  make  a   better  decision—information  we  didn’ t  know  we  needed before.  It’ s  easy  to  sit  back  and  think  the  right  information  will  find  you.  It won’ t! How to Safeguard the Solution-Exploring Stage Just  because  you’ve  thought  of   a  couple  solutions,  though,  do esn’ t  mean you’ve  eliminat ed  your  blind  spots.  Binary  thinking  is  when  y ou  consider only  two  options  to  a  problem.  When  you  first  look  at  the  choice,  it  seems simple:  W e  launch  the  product  or  we  don’ t.  W e  take  the  new   job  or  we don’ t.  W e  get  married  or  we  do n’ t.  It’ s  black  and  white:  “do”  or  “do  not.” There isn’ t any middle ground. Most  of  the  time,  though,  th is  type  of  thinking  is  limiting .  Some decisions  might  seem  to  come  down  to  a  choice  between  this  or  that,  but there’ s  o ften  another  option.  The  best  decision-makers  know  this,  and  see binary  t hinking  as  a  sign  that  we  don’ t  fully  understand  a  pro blem—that we’re  trying  to  reduce  the  probl em’ s  dimensions  before  fully  understanding them. When  we  start  exploring  a  pr oblem  in  detail,  things  become  more complicated before we understand it well enough to see the alternatives. Problem-solving  novices  try  to  reduce  a  decision  to  just  two   options because  it  creates  the  false  se nse  that  they’ve  gotten  to  the   problem’ s essence.  In  reality ,  they’ve  just  stopped  thinking.  And  you  ne ver  want  to stop  thin king!  N ovices  fail  to  s ee  the  complexities  of  a  probl em  that  are apparent  to  a  master .  Masters  s ee  the  simplicity  hiding  in  the  complexity . As  F rederic  Maitland  purported ly  once  wrote,  “Simplicity  is  th e  end  result of  lo ng,  hard  wo rk,  not  the  starting  point.”  When  we  reduce  the  problem  to black-and-white  solutions,  we  need  to  check  to  make  sure  we’re  the  master and not the novice. This brings us to the next principle of ef fective problem-solving: T H E   3 +  P R I N  C  I P L E :   Forc e  yourself  to  explore  at  least  th ree  possible  solutions  to  a problem.  If  you  find  yourself  considering  only  two  options,  force  yourself  to   find  at least one more. Binary  framing  is  as  comfortable  as  it  is  passive.  Doing  the  wo rk  to  add  a third  opt ion  forces  us  to  be  creative  and  really  dig  into  the  probl em.  Even  if we  don’ t  choose   the  third  optio n,  forcing  ourselves  to  develop  it  helps  us understand  the  problem  better .  It  gives  us  more  opportunities  to  align  our decisions  with  our  goals,  of fers  more  optionality  in  the  future,  an d  increases the chances that we’ll be happier with our decision down the road. There are two safeguards against binary thinking. The first is this: S A F E  G  U A R D :   Imagine  that  one  of  the  options  is  off  the  table.   T ake  each  of  the  options you’re  considering,  and  one  at  a  time,  ask  yourself,  “What  would  I  do  if  that  were  not possible?” Suppose  you’re   considering  what  to  do  about  a  job  where  yo u  don’ t  get along  w ith  a  coworker .  Binary  thinking  tells  you  to  stay  or  leave .  Imagining that  one  option  is  of f  the  table   forces  you  to  see  the  problem  dif ferently . Imagine  that,  for  some  reason,  there  is  absolutely  no  w ay  to  quit  your  job: Y ou  must  stay .  Now  you  are  forced  to  see  things  through  a  new  lens.  What could  you  do  to  make  going  to  work  every  day  more  enjoyable,  despite  the problem  with  your  coworker?  What  could  you  do  to  remain  at  y our  job  and still  mov e  closer  to  your  goals?   What  could  you  do  to  give  yo urself  more options  in  the  fu ture  so  you’re  not  stuck  feeling  powerless?  Ma ybe  staying means  having  a  hard  conversati on  with  your  boss  and  your  coworker  that you  haven’ t  had  yet.======================================================== bullets  and  calibrating—keeps  your  options  open  before you  commit  the  bulk  of  your  resources  to  shooting  a  cannonba ll.  Thinking about  medical  school?  Shadow   a  doctor  or  a  resident  for  a  day .  T ake  the MCA T  and  see  what  you  score,   or  apply  to  colleges  and  see  where  you’re accepted.  Thinking  about  a  new  career?  T ry  doing  it  freelance  a  few  nights per  week  first.  Thinking  about  launching  a  new  product?  See  if  people  are willing to pay for it before you build it. Preserving  options  carries  a  cost  and  can  make  you  feel  like  you’re missing  out.  It’ s  hard  watching  others  take  action  sometimes,  even  when those  actions  don’ t  make  sense  for  you.  Don’ t  be  fooled!  This  is  the  social default  at  work.  It  tempts  you  to  feel  like  it’ s  okay  to  fail  so  long  as  you’re part of the crowd. While  some  people  are  quick  to  join  the  crowd,  others  prefer  to  be correct.  Preservi ng  optionality  can  make  you  look  stupid  in  the   short  term, which  m eans  th at  from  time  to  time  you’ll  have  to  tolerate  people  treating you  like  you’re  a  fool.  But  if  you  look  at  the  most  successful  p eople  in  the world,  th ey’ve  a ll  looked  short-term  stupid  on  a  number  of  occasions,  when they were keeping their options open and waiting for the right time to act. W arren  Buf fett  sat  out  most  of  the  dot-com  craze  of  the  late  ’ 90s,  and appeared  to  miss  the  stampeding  bull  market  that  came  with   it.  People began  c hattering  that  he’d  lost  his  touch.  He  may  have  looked  stupid  to some  speculators  for  a  few  years—until  the  tech  bubble  burst  and  he  still had tremendous cash reserves. Live with a Decision before Announcing It Have  you  ever  spent  time  crafting  an  email,  and  then  instantly  regretted  it as  s oon  as  you  hit  “Send”?  I  have.  It’ s  one  of  the  worst  feelings  in  the world.  Perhaps  not  as  bad,  though,  as  announcing  a  major  decision  too  soon and then realizing it was a mistake. Many  leaders  want  to  announce   a  decision  the  moment  they’ve  made  it. This  is  natural:  they  want  to  show  others  how  decisive  they  are,  and  let everyone  else  revel  in  their  da zzling  new  venture.  But  announcing  right away  can  be  lik e  the  email  you  can’ t  unsend.  It  starts  things  m oving,  and makes  c hanging  your  mind  much  harder .  That’ s  why  I  create d  a  rule  for myself:  I  make  major  decisions  and  then  sleep  on  them  be fore  telling anyone. [*] However ,  it  turned  out  that  s leeping  on  decisions  by  itself  wasn’ t enough.  I  added  another  elemen t  to  the  rule:  before  going  to  b ed,  I  would write  a  note  to  myself  explaining  why  I’d  made  the  decision.  Doing  so allowed  me  to  m ake  the  invisible  visible.  When  I  woke  up  in  th e  morning, I’d  read  the  note .  More  often  th an  I’d  like  to  admit,  my  best  thinking  from the  d ay  before  fell  short  upon  inspection  in  the  harsh  light  of  the  morning. Sometimes  I’d  realize  I  really  didn’ t  understand  the  problem  as  well  as  I thought  I  did.  Other  times,  it  just  didn’ t  feel  right  anymore.  And  I’ve  come to learn that this feeling is important to explore. Living  w ith  a  decision  before  an nouncing  it  allows  you  to  look  at  it  from a  ne w  perspective  and  verify  your  assumptions.  Once  you’v e  made  the decision—even  if  you  haven’ t  communicated  it—you  start  see ing  things  in a  new  light. [*]   Y our  brain  processes  all  the  potential  results  of  the  decision as  though  it  had   already  been  m ade  and  put  into  action.  This  can  often  help you  see  nuances   you  might  hav e  missed,  and  those  might,  in  turn,  change how  you  implement  the  decision.  Maybe  you’re  promoting  someone,  and you’re  w orried  about  their  ability  to  lead  a  meeting  and  or ganize  a  team. Living  w ith  the  decision  might  spur  you  to  have  them  or ganize  a  meeting, see what happens, and recalibrate if necessary . Also,  liv ing  wit h  a  decision  on   your  own  for  a  day—or  even  two— allows  you  to  check  it  with  your  emotions.  Does  this  decision  feel  good  in your  bon es?  Do   your  brain  and  your  heart  and  your  guts  all  agree  with  it? Most  decisions  will  feel  fine.  Bu t  a  handful  won’ t.  If  one  doesn’ t  feel  right, it’ s  a  sign  that  something  is  of f,  and  you  need  to  dig  de eper  before announcing  your  decision.  Kee ping  it  to  yourself  before  executing  allows you to keep open the possibility of undoing it. The Fail-Safe Principle Implementing  fail-safes  will  help  ensure  that  your  decision  is  executed according to plan. Imagine  standing  on  Mount  Everest,  just  fifty  meters  from  reaching======================================================== E R A B I L I T I E S   T H A T    C  A N   I M P E D E    G  O O D judgment:  sleep  deprivation,  h unger ,  fatigue,  emotion,  distrac tion,  stress from  fee ling  rus hed,  and  being  in  an  unfamiliar  environment  are  just  some examples.  W e  can’ t  avoid  finding  ourselves  in  these  conditions  f rom  time  to time.  But  we  c an  implement  safeguards  to  protect  us  from  o ur  defaults when we are. Safeguards  are  tools  for  protecting  ourselves  from  ourselve s—from weaknesses that we don’ t have the strength to overcome. Here’ s  a  simple  example.  Suppose  you  want  to  start  eating  a  healthier diet.  Y ou   make  this  task  exponentially  harder  on  yourself  if  you  inhabit  an unhealthy  envir onment—if,  say ,  your  pantry  and  fridge  are  full  of  junk food.  Pu r ging  your  home  of  al l  junk  food  is  a  safeguard.  It  p rotects  you against  i mpulsively  ripping  open  a  bag  of  potato  chips  when  you’re  feeling hungry  or  bored.  Of  course,  you  can  still  go  to  the  store  and  buy  chips,  but that’ s  a  lot  of  work.  Y ou  have  to  think,  plan,  and  act.  In  the  time  it  takes  you to  do  all  that,  y ou  might  think  better  of  your  options,  and  choose  to  eat something more in line with your health goals. Pur ging  your  home  of  all  junk  food  is  an  example  of  one  safeguarding strategy:  increasing  the  amount  of  “friction”  required  to  do  something  that’ s contrary  to  your  long-term  goals.  There  are  lots  of  safeguard  strategies, though. My favorites include prevention, creating rules for yourself, making checklists,  shifting  your  frame   of  reference,  and  making  the  invisible visible. Let’ s talk about each strategy . Safeguard Strategy 1: Prevention The  first  kind  of   safeguard  aims  at  preventing  problems  before  t hey  happen. One  way   to  do  this  is  to  avoid  decision-making  in  unfavorable   conditions. Stress,  f or  instan ce,  is  a  big  contributor  to  bad  decisions.  Some  studies  have shown  that  stress  short-circuits  the  deliberation  process—it  undermines  the systematic  evaluation  of  alternatives  that’ s  needed  for  ef fective  decision- making. [1] Alcoholics  Anonymous  has  a  helpful  safeguard  for  its  members.  They call  it  HAL T— an  acronym  that  stands  for  Hungry ,  Angry ,  Lonely ,  and T ired.  When  you  feel  like  having  a  drink,  they  say ,  ask  yourself  whether any  of  these  co nditions  apply .  If  so,  deal  with  the  real  proble m—hunger , anger , loneliness, or fatigue—instead of reaching for a drink. Y ou  can  use  the  principles  behind  HAL T  as  a  safeguard  for  decision- making  in  general.  If  you  have  a n  important  decision  to  make,  a sk  yourself: “Am  I  hungry?  Am  I  angry  or  otherwise  emotional?  Am  I  lonely  or otherwise  stressed  by  my  circumstances,  such  as  being  in  an  unfamiliar environment  or  pressed  for  time?  Am  I  tired,  sleep-deprived,  or  physically fatigued?”  If  the  answer  is  ye s  to  any  of  these  questions,  avoid  making  the decision  if  you  can.  W ait  for  a  more  opportune  time.  Othe rwise,  your defaults will take over . Safeguard Strategy 2: Automatic Rules for Success Reactive  choices  are  automatic   responses  to  a  stimulus.  Most  of  these responses  are  below  the  level  o f  consciousness:  W e’re  not  even  aware  of them.  So metimes  we’re  able  to  slow  down  enough  to  override  our  ingrained responses, but this requires a lot of conscious ef fort on our part. Fortunately , there’ s  a n  easier   way:  creating  new  behaviors  that  help  you  get  what  you want. Think of them as automatic rules for success. Nothing  forces  you  to  accept  t he  ingrained  behaviors  and  rules  from your upbringing and life circumstances. Y ou can decide to eliminate them at any time, and replace them with better ones. In my conversation with Nobel laureate Daniel Kahneman, the godfather of  cogni tive  bia ses  and  thinking  errors,  he  revealed  an  unexpected  way  we can improve our judgment: replacing decisions with rules. [2]  It turns out that rules  can  help  us  automate  our  behavior  to  put  us  in  a  position   to  achieve success and accomplish our goals. When  we  make  decisions,  we  often  think  of  the  goals  we  want  to achieve  and  work  backward  to  identify  the  means  of  achieving  them.  If  you want  to  get  in  sh ape,  you  start  g oing  to  the  gym  and  eating  healthier .  If  you want  to  save  more  money ,  you  might  hide  part  of  your  paycheck  from yourself every week. W e use our willpower to accomplish these goals. Once they’re  accomplished,  we  often  go  back  to  the  default  behavior  we  had before.  Eventually  we  realize  we’re  back  where  we  don’ t  want  to  be,  so  we begin the entire process again. This  approach  is  flawed.  It======================================================== every  bad  decision  is  rushed,  nor  is  every  good  one  made  slowly .  It’ s  not that simple. People  m istake  cho osing  for  decisiveness  and  the  decision-making  process  for waf fling.  Part  of  w hat  makes  slowing  down  and  reasoning  through  a  pro blem dif ficult  is  that,  to  the  outside  observer ,  it  might  look  like  inaction.  But  inaction   is  a choice. When  the  stakes  are  low ,  inaction  hurts  you  more  than  speed.  Sometimes  it’ s better  jus t  to  make  a  quick  choice  and  not  spend  time  deliberatin g.  Why  waste time  evaluating  if  an  action  is  inconsequential  and  its  ef fects  are  easily  reversed? For  example,  if  there  are  two  identical  squat  racks  in  the  gym  and  both  are momentarily  open,  it  makes  no  dif fere nce  which  one  you  take.  If  you  wai t  and decide, they’ll both be taken by someone else. Just choose either one. When  the  stakes  are  higher ,  though,  speed  can  hurt  you.  If  an  action  could have  a  major  impact  on  your  life  or  your  business  and  its  ef fects  can’t  be  reve rsed, you  m ust  decide  and  not  merely  choose.  In  these  cases,  the  magnitude  of  the potential  l osses  ma kes  careful  decision-making  a  worthwhile  investment  of  your time. In these cases, evaluate the options and decide. Don’t just choose. The  n ext  few  sectio ns  describe  some  tools  for  reasoning  better  when  maki ng decisions.  They  won’t  solve  every  de cision-making  problem,  because  no  tool  is right  for  every  job;  each  has  its  uses  and  limitations.  Y ou  need  multiple  tools  in your  toolb ox.  Otherwise,  you  end  up  solving  the  wrong  problems.  As  the  old  adage says,  “If  the  only  tool  you  have  is  a  ha mmer ,  you  tend  to  see  every  problem  as  a nail.” Knowing  h ow  to  use  these  tools  depen ds  on  keeping  your  defaults  in  check  so you  can   r eason.  If  you  can’ t,  you’ll  just  react  with  one  of  your  defaults.  While  you might  get  the  outcomes  you  desire  for  a  while,  it’ s  only  a  matter  of  time  before  lack of  thinking   catches  up  to  you.  It’ s  only   after  you’ve  mastered  the  defaults  that  the tools I describe become useful. If  you   can’t  keep  those  in  check—if  y ou’re  easily  swayed  by  emotion,  if  you can’t  adap t  to  change,  if  you  value  bei ng  right  more  than  doing  what’ s  best—then all  the  tools  in  the  w orld  aren’t  going  to   help  you.  The  defaults  will  overwhelm  you, rout your decision-making process, and seize control of your life. ⦁ OceanofPDF .com CHAPTER 4.1 D e f i n e   t h e   P r o b l e m T H E   F I R S T   P R I N  C  I P L E   O F   D E  C  I S I O N - M A K I N  G    I S   T H A T   T H E   D E  C  I D E R   N E E D S   T O   D E F I N E the  problem. [*]   I f  you’r e  not  the  one  making  th e  decision,  you  can  suggest the  p roblem  that  needs  to  be  sol ved,  but  you  don’ t  get  to  define  it.  Only  the person  responsib le  for  the  outcome  does.  The  decision-maker  can  take  input from  an ywhere—bosses,  subordinates,  colleagues,  experts,  etc.  However , the  resp onsibility  to  get  to  the  bottom  of  the  problem—to  so rt  fact  from opinion and determine what’ s really happening—rests with them. Defining  the  problem  starts  wit h  identifying  two  things:  (1)  w hat  you want to achieve, and (2) what obstacles stand in the way of getting it. Unfortunately , people too often end up solving the wrong problem. Perhaps  you  can  relate  to  this  scenario,  which  I’ve  seen  thousands  of times  over  the  years.  A  decision-maker  assembles  a  diverse  team  to  solve  a critical  and  time-sensitive  problem.  There  are  ten  people  in  the  room  all giving  input  about  what’ s  happening—each  from  a  dif ferent  perspective. W ithin  a  few  m inutes  someone  announces  what  they  think  the  problem  is, the  room  goes  silent  for  a  microsecond  .  .  .  and  then  everyone  starts discussing possible solutions. Often  th e  first  plausible  description  of  the  situation  defines  the  problem that  the  team  will  try  to  solve. [*]   Once  the  group  comes  up  with  a  solution, the  decision-maker  feels  good.  That  person  then  allocates  resources  toward the  idea  and  expects  the  problem  to  be  solved.  But  it  isn’ t.  Because  the  first lens  into  an  issue  rarely  revea ls  what  the  real  problem  is,  so  the  real problem doesn’ t get solved. What’ s happening here? The  social  default  prompts  us  to  accept  the  first  definition  people  agree on  a nd  m ove  fo rward.  Once  someone  states  a  problem,  the  team  shifts  into “solution”  mode  without  considering  whether  the  problem  has   even  been correctly  define d.  This  is  what   happens  when  you  put  a  bunch  of  smart, type  A  people  to gether  and  tell  them======================================================== experiment  by  p eople,  I  am  constantly  surprised.  W e  all know  something   we  could  do  to  improve  our  odds  of  success.  And  we  all know  so mething  we  can  stop  d oing  that  would  also  improve  our  odds  of success. Just  because  I  can’ t  control  all  the  things  I  need  to  do  doesn’ t  mean  I can’ t  con trol  wh en  I  do  them.  The  version  of  me  that  I’d  want  the  film  crew to see focused on what mattered. Using  this  prompt,  I  decided  to   create  space  every  day  to  work  on  the biggest opportunities. I imagined the film crew  watching me make breakfast for  the  kids  and  then  going  to  work.  While  the  crew  would  be  expecting  to see  meetings  and  people  asking  me  for  things,  what  they’d  see  is  no  calls  or meetings  until  lunch  so  I  could  spend  time  working  on  the  most  important opportunity . This is where my no-meetings-before-lunch rule came from. [*] W e’re  ta ught  ou r  whole  lives  to  follow  rules,  and  yet  no  one  ever  told  us about  how  we  c an  create  powerful  rules  that  help  us  get  what  we  want.  I find  it  hard  to  go  to  the  gym  thre e  days  a  week,  so  my  rule  is  I  g o  every  day . I  do   not  feel  like  going  to  the  gym  every  day .  In  fact,  some  days  I  hate  it.  I also  kno w  it’ s  easier  to  follow  my  rule  than  to  break  it.  When   it  comes  to the gym, going every day is easier than going some days. Creating  person al  rules  is  a  powerful  technique  for  protecting  yourself from  yo ur  own  weaknesses  and  limitations.  Sometimes  those   rules  have surprising benefits. Safeguard Strategy 3: Creating Friction Another  safegua rding  strategy  is  to  increase  the  amount  of  ef fort  it  takes  to do  th ings  that  are  contrary  to  your  goals.  I  used  to  find  myself  checking  my email  whenever  I  have  a  second.  I’d  check  it  before  I  got  out  of  bed,  on  the walk home from work, in line at the grocery store. It’ s  easy  to  tell  myself  that  I’m  n ot  the  only  one,  that  everyone  does  this too.  The  dopamine  hit  of  something  new  prevents  many  of  us  from  working on  our  priorities.  It  isn’ t  just  th at  I  was  spending  too  much  time  on  email, though,  it’ s  that  email  could  hijack  my  time  from  what’ s  important.  The scary  thing  is,  I  often  wanted   it   to  tak e  me  away  from  what  I   was  supposed to be doing. Consider a major report I needed to complete early in my career . I would get  to  work  and  rather  than  wr ite  the  report,  which  was  clear ly  the  most important  thing  for  me  to  do,  I’ d  check  my  email.  If  there  was  anything  in my  inbox  that  required  even  a  modicum  of  attention,  I’d  tell  myself  I needed  t o  do  that  before  starting  on  the  report.  And,  of  course,  by  the  time  I was  don e  with  that  first  email,  more  had  come  in  that  needed  attention.  It didn’ t  take  much  to  convince  myself  I  needed  to  do  that  before  I  started. Only  near  the  end  of  the  workday  would  I  finally  sit  down  to  write  the report, mentally exhausted. When  you  step  b ack  and  think  a bout  it  for  a  second,  I  was  giving  one  of the  most  important  things  I  wan ted  to  do  the  worst  of  myself.  Email,  which I  d read  on  the  best  of  days,  was  getting  my  most  ener getic  and  c reative  self. Many  of   us  do  this  with  our  part ners  too.  By  the  time  everything  we  need  to do  over  the  course  of  a  long  day  is  finished,  we’re  exhausted.  And  this  is the time we give to our spouse, the most important person in our lives! If  there  were  a  recipe  for  accum ulated  disaster ,  it  would  be  gi ving  the best  of  ourselve s  to  the  least  important  things  and  the  worst  of  ourselves  to the most important things. The  path  to  breaking  bad  habi ts  is  making  your  desired  beha vior  the default  behavior .  T o  get  on  track  with  the  report,  I  told  my  colleagues  that until  the  report  was  submitted,  I’d  buy  them  all  lunch  if  they  caught  me with  my   email  open  before  1 1:00  a.m.  My  being  competitive  and  not wanting  to  buy  them  lunch  created  enough  friction  to  keep  me  from checking it first thing in the morning. I’d  wor k  free  from  distraction  all  morning.  In  the  afternoon,  I’d  do email, take calls, and attend or conduct meetings. It’ s incredible how much I got done. It’ s  e asy  to  unde restimate  the  role  ease  plays  in  decision-making.  Since behavior  follows  the  path  of  least  resistance,  a  surprisingly  successful approach  is  to  a dd  friction  where  you  find  yourself  doing  things  you  don’ t want to do. Safeguard Strategy 4: Putting in Guardrails Another  safeguarding  strategy  is  to  formulate  operating  procedures  for yourself  because  you  know======================================================== dubbed  the  “Hanoi  Hilton”).  He  was tortured  over  twenty  times  during  an  eight-year  imprisonment  and  given  no release  date,  no  prisoner  rights,  and  no  certainty  whether  he  would  survive to see his family again. When   C  ollins  asked  Stockdale  about  his  fellow  prisoners  who  didn’ t survive  the  camp,  the  admiral  singled  out  the  optimists.  “Oh,  they  were  the ones  who  said,  ‘W e’re  going  to  be  out  by  Christmas.’  And  Christmas  would come,  and  Christmas  would  go.  Then  they’d  say ,  ‘W e’re  going  to  be  out  by Easter .’  And  Easter  would  c ome,  and  Easter  would  go.  And  then Thanksgiving,  a nd  then  it  woul d  be  Christmas  again.  And  the y  died  of  a broken heart.” After  a  long  pause,  he  turned  to  Collins  and  said,  “This  is   a  very important  lesson .  Y ou  must  nev er  confuse  faith  that  you  will  prevail  in  the end—which  you  can  never  af ford  to  lose—with  the  discipline  to  confront the most brutal facts of your current reality , whatever they might be.” [1] Collins  called  this  combination  of  faith  in  prevailing  with  the  d iscipline to  co nfront  brutal  facts  the  Stockdale  Paradox.  He  says  he  still  carries  with him  the  mental  image  of  Stockd ale  admonishing  the  optimists:   “W e’re  not getting out by Christmas; deal with it!” Problems Don’t Disappear by Themselves W e  all  face  dif f icult  problems.  The  defaults  narrow  our  perspective.  They narrow  our  view  of  the  world  and  tempt  us  to  see  things  as  we  wish  them  to be,  not  as  they  are.  Only  by  dealing  with  reality—the  often-brutal  truth  of how the world really works—can we secure the outcomes we want. The  wor st  thing  we  can  do  with  a  dif ficult  problem  is  resort  to  magical thinking—putting  our  heads  in  the  sand  and  hoping  the  pr oblem  will disappear on its own or that a solution will present itself to us. The  future  is  not  like  the  weather .  It  doesn’ t  just  happen  to  us.  W e  shape our  futu re  with  the  choices  we   make  in  the  present,  just  as  our  present situation was shaped by choices we made in the past. Wherever  we  are  now  is  a  reflection  of  the  past  choices  and  behaviors that  got  us  here.   If  we’re  in  a  ha ppy  relationship,  we  can  look  back  and  see the years of ef fort, communication, negotiation, luck, and (possibly) therapy that  got  us  to  this  point.  If  we  w ake  up  bleary-eyed  and  muddleheaded,  we can  see  how  ex cessive  drinking  the  night  before  disrupted  o ur  sleep.  If we’re  op erating  a  successful  business,  we  can  see  how  running   lean  at  the right  times,  or  perhaps  doubling  down  when  things  weren’ t  so  certain, contributed to our current success. If  only  we  had  the  benefit  of  hindsight  for  the  decisions  we  make  today —if  only  we  co uld  see  the  pre sent  with  the  insight  and  clarity  we  have about  th e  past!  The  philosopher  Søren  Kierkegaard  once  said,  “Life  can only be understood backwards, but it must be lived forwards.” Luckily ,  there’ s   a  way  to  convert  the  hindsight  of  tomorrow  into  the foresight  of  today .  It’ s  a  tho ught  experiment  that  psychologists  call pr emortem .  T he  concept  is n’ t  new ,  it  origin ates  in  Stoic  philosophy .  Seneca used  pr emeditatio malorum   (“the  premeditation  of  evils”)  to  prepare  for  the inevitable  ups  and  downs  of  life.  The  point  isn’ t  to  worry  abou t  problems; it’ s to fortify and prepare for them. The  hardest  setbacks  to  deal  with  are  the  ones  we’re  not  prepared  for and  don ’ t  expect.  That’ s  why  you  need  to  anticipate  them  before  they happen and act now in order to avoid them. Many  pe ople  thi nk  they’re  bad  p roblem  solvers  when  in  fact  they’re  bad problem  anticipators.  Most  of  us  don’ t  want  to  think  about  more  problems; we  h ave  enough  already .  W e  think  that  before  bad  things  happen,  we’ll  get a  w arning,  we’ll  have  time  to  prepare,  we’ll  be  ready .  But  the  w orld  doesn’ t work that way . Bad  thin gs  happen  to  good  people  all  the  time.  W e  get  laid  of f  without warning. W e get into a car accident. Our boss  comes into our of fice and lays into  us.  A  pandemic  spreads  throughout  the  world.  No  warnings .  No  time  to prepare. Performing  a  premortem  might   not  save  you  from  every  disaster ,  but you’ll be surprised by how many it can save you from. Here’ s how it works. What Could Go W rong? Imagining what could go wrong doesn’ t make you pessimistic. It makes you prepared.  If  you  haven’ t  though t  about  the  things  that  could  go  wrong,  you will  be  at  the  mercy  of  circumstances.  Fear ,  anger ,  panic—when  emotion consumes you, reason leaves you. Y ou just react. The antidote is this principle: T H E   B A D======================================================== these  goals above  all  others  and  pursued  th em  relentlessly .  In  the  end,  he  got  what  he thought  he  wanted.  But  it  left  h im  feeling  empty .  He  achieved  what  he’d wanted  at  the  expense  of  having   meaningful  relationships—which,  he  came to  re alize,  was  something  that  r eally  mattered.  Unlike  Scrooge ,  he  got  no second chance. How  many  of  u s—at  whatever  stages  of  our  careers—are  on  t he  same trajectory?  W e  value  wealth  and  status  more  than  happiness—the  external more  tha n  the  internal—and  we   give  little  thought  to  how  we  p ursue  them. In  th e  pr ocess,  w e  end  up  chasi ng  praise  and  recognition  from  people  who don’ t matter at the expense of people who do. I’ve  known  many  successful  people  whose  lives  I  wouldn’ t  want  to have.  Th ey  had  intelligence,  they  had  drive,  they  had  opportun ity ,  and  the wherewithal  to  use  them  all.  Bu t  they  were  missing  something  else.  They knew  how  to  get  what  they  wanted,  but  the  things  they  wanted  weren’ t worth  wanting.  In  fact,  the  things  they  wanted  ended  up  disfiguring  their lives.  They  were  missing  what  Scrooge  gains  at  the  happy  turning  point  of his  story—that  ingredient  that  m akes  the  dif ference  between  the  unhappy masses and the happy few . The  ancient  Greeks  had  a  word  for  this  ingredient:  phr onesis —the wisdom of knowing how to order your life to achieve the best results. When  you  look  back  to  the  d ecisions  you  made  as  a  teenag er ,  they probably  seem  pretty  silly  now .   The  time  you  stole  (I  mean  borr owed )  the car  f rom  your  parents,  the  time  you  got  too  drunk  at  a  party  and   maybe  did some  st uf f  you  shouldn’ t  have  (thankfully  there  were  no  camera  phones back  the n),  the  time  you   got  into  a  fight  with  a  friend  over  a  potential  mate. These  decisions   didn’ t  seem  stu pid  at  the  time  so  why  do  they  appear  so now?  Because  you  have  perspective  now  that  was  inaccessible  to  you  back then.  What  seemed  like  the  mos t  important  thing  in  the  world  at  the  time— the very thing that consumed you—seems silly now in hindsight. W isdom  requires  all  the  things  we’ve  talked  about:  the  ability   to  keep the  defaults  in  check,  to  create  space  for  reason  and  reflection ,  to  use  the principles  and  safeguards  that  m ake  for  ef fective  decisions.  But  being  wise requires  more.  It’ s  more  than  knowing  how  to  get  what  you  want.  It’ s  also knowing  which  things  are  worth  wanting—which  things  really  matter .  It’ s as  m uch  about  saying  no  as  saying  yes.  W e  can’ t  copy  the  life  decisions  of other  people  and  expect  better  results.  If  we  want  to  live  the  best  life  we can, we need a dif ferent approach. Knowing  what  to  want  is  the  most  important  thing.  Deep  do wn,  you already  know  what  to  do,  you  just  need  to  follow  your  own  advice. Sometimes, it’ s the advice we give other people that we most need to follow ourselves.

[1]   He’d  seen numerous  studies  showing  that  people  in  their  seventies,  eighties,  and beyond  were  happier  than  younger  people.  He  was  intrigued:  “I  kept meeting  older  people—many  o f  whom  had  lost  loved  ones,  been  through tremendous  dif ficulties,  and  had  serious  health  problems —but  who nevertheless  we re  happy ,  fulfilled,  and  deeply  enjoying  life.  I  fo und  myself asking: ‘What’ s that all about?’ ” One  day   it  hit  h im:  Maybe  older  people  just  knew  things  about   living  a happy  life  that  younger  people   didn’ t.  Maybe  they  could  see  things  we couldn’ t  see.  If  any  population  demographic  could  lay  claim  to  expertise  in living  a  happy  life,  it  would  be  seniors.  Y et  to  Pillemer ’ s  surprise,  no  one seemed  to  have  done  a  study  on  what  practical  advice  older  people  had  for the  younger  generation.  That  s et  Pillemer  of f  on  a  seven-year  quest  to discover “the practical wisdom of older people.” Their  number  one  lesson:  life  is  short!  “The  older  the  resp ondent,” Pillemer  said,  “the  more  likely  [they  were]  to  say  that  life  passes  b y  in  what seems  like  an  instant.”  When  elders  tell  younger  people  that  life  is  short, they’re  not  being  macabre  or  pe ssimistic.  They’re  instead  trying  to  of fer  a perspective  that  they  hope  will  i nspire  better  decisions—ones  that  prioritize the  t hings  that  re ally  matter .  “I  wish  I’d  learned  this  in======================================================== don’ t  consider  how  things   might  go  wrong  and  plan  for  them  in advance,  we’re  left  flat-footed  when  they  do  go  wrong.  Then  we  end  up reacting  instead  of  reasoning.  It ’ s  much  easier  to  plan  for  things  that  could go  w rong  in  ad vance  when  you’re  calm  and  open-minded  t han  it  is  to respond when things are in the midst of going wrong. When  failure  is  expensive,  it’ s  worth  investing  in  lar ge  mar gins  of safety . If you’re an investor , you’ve likely heard the story of Long-T erm Capital Management  (L TCM),  a  hedg e  fund  founded  in  1994  by  a  prominent investor  who  managed  to  get  two  Nobel  laureates  on  his  board.  L TCM  h ad a  hig h  risk  portf olio  that  was  highly  acclaimed  for  its  incredib le  returns— over  21  percent  in  its  first  year ,   then  43  percent  in  its  second  y ear ,  and  41 percent in its third year . Imagine  being  an  investor  in  this  environment.  Y ou  see  this  hedge  fund taking  o f f,  and  your  friends  are  boasting  of  their  success  and  ur ging  you  to join  in  on  the  b onanza.  They  tell  you  about  the  amazing  peop le  working there—people  w ith  incredibly  high  IQs,  including  two  Nobel  Prize  winners, who  are  also  experienced  in  their  respective  fields  and  who  have  invested substantial amounts of their own money . Y ou  watch  your  friends  double  and  then  quadruple  their  investments. Y ou  star t  wondering  whether  you  should  invest  everything  as  well.  Y our own  por tfolio  is   returning  8  to  12  percent  year  over  year—good   returns,  but not  40  percent!  Is  the  rest  of  the  world  going  to  get  rich  while  you  play  it safe? Consider  now  two  scenarios.  In  the  first,  you  decide  to  follow  your friends  a nd  inve st  everything  you  have  in  the  fund.  A  few  m onths  later , Asia  and  Russia  experience  a  financial  crisis.  That  crisis  together  with L TCM’ s  highly  leveraged  inves tments  loses  them  $4.6  billion  in  less  than four  mo nths.  The  chart  on  the  next  page  shows  what  that  loss  would  look like  if  you  had  in vested  $1,000  from  the  beginning  in  1994.  In  th is  scenario, you (and your friends) end up in financial ruin. Imagine  now  a  dif ferent  scenari o.  It’ s  November  1997.  Y ou  just  hit  the peak  of  returns  at  L TCM.  If  you  anticipate  that  the  future  is  going  to  be dif ferent from the past, you probably won’ t assume astronomical losses, and might invest a little. But if you’re wise, you’ll maintain a mar gin of safety . A  mar gi n  of  safety  is  a  buf fer  b etween  what  you  expect  to  happen  and what could happen. It’ s designed to save you when surprises are expensive. Sour ce:  Jay Henry , W ikimedia Commons, October 26, 2009 A  m ar gin  of  safety  is  like  having  insurance.  If  you  know  in  advance  you won’ t  need  to  make  a  claim  this  year ,  it’ s  a  waste  of  money  to  buy insurance.  The  problem  is  that  y ou  don’ t  know  in  what  year  you’ll  need  to make  a  claim,  so  you  buy  it  every  year .  It  might  seem  like  a  waste  of  money in  y ears  when  n othing  happens ,  but  it  shows  its  real  value  in  years  when something does. Building  a  mar gin  of  safety  me ans  giving  yourself  as  much  cushioning and  coverage  in  the  future  as  possible.  It’ s  a  way  of  preparing  yourself  for the  widest  range  of  possible  future  outcomes—and  protecting  yourself against  the  worst  ones.  In  the  second  scenario,  for  instance,  you  can  prepare yourself  for  the  various  bad  outcomes  that  1998  might  bring  by  investing only  one  tenth  of  your  portfoli o  in  the  fund.  As  a  result,  whe n  the  1998 financial  crisis  comes,  you’ll  lose  at  most  10  percent  of  your  i nvestments. That won’ t leave you happy , but it won’ t leave you financially ruined either . Y our  defaults  are  hard  at  work  in  the  first  scenario—not  just  the  social default  t hat  convinces  you  that  you’re  better  of f  following  the  crowd,  but the  ego  default  as  well.  It  conv inces  you  that  you  don’ t  need  a  mar gin  of safety ,  b ecause  you  know  what’ s  going  to  happen.  Y ou  feel  confident predicting  the  future—predicting  that  the  future  is  going  to  be  like  the  past, that  L TCM’ s  fourth  year  is  goin g  to  be  like  its  first  three.  The   problem  is that  tomorrow  is  never  exactly  like  today ,  and  in  that  fourth  year ,  the  plan that garnered L TCM’ s success in the previous three years stops working. In  the  second  s cenario,  your  decision  isn’ t  based  on  a  prediction;  it’ s instead  prepared   for  a  future  in  which  your  best-case  scenario  might  not materialize.  It’ s  that  preparation  mindset—as  opposed  to  a  prediction mindset—that saves you in the second======================================================== ar guing  that  horses  and  carriages  were  a  more  reliable  mode  of transportation.  Similarly ,  when  the  airplane  was  first  invented,  people  were skeptical  of  its  p racticality  and  safety .  The  radio,  television,  and   internet  all faced similar initial skepticism, yet despite this, each of these inventions has had a profound impact on the way we live today . The  “zone  of  average”  is  a  dangerous  place  when  it  comes  to  in ertia.  It’ s the  poin t  where  things  are  work ing  well  enough  that  we  don’ t  feel  the  need to  m ake  any  ch anges.  W e  hope  things  will  magically  improve .  Of  course, they  rar ely  do.  For  example,  st aying  in  a  relationship  that  is  too  good  to leave  an d  too  bad  to  stay  is  a  perfect  example  of  the  zone  of  average.  If things  w ere  mu ch  worse,  we  w ould  act,  but  since  they’re  not  terrible,  we stay , and hope things get better . Doubling Down When Y ou’re W rong As  the  famous  q uote  often  falsely  attributed  to  Charles  Darwin   goes,  “It’ s not  the  stronges t  of  the  species   that  survives,  nor  the  most  intelligent  that survives.  It  is  the  one  that  is  mo st  adaptable  to  change.” [3]   Even  though  it’ s a misquotation, it’ s not useless just because it’ s not Darwin. When  ci rcumstances  change,  we   need  to  adapt.  But  inertia  closes  minds and  stifles  the  motivation  to  change  how  we’ve  been  doing  things.  It  makes it  harder  to  imagine  alternative  methods,  and  discourages  experimentation and course correction. For  instance,  public  statements  can  create  inertia.  Putting  something  on the  reco rd  establishes  expectatio ns  along  with  social  pressure  to  meet  those expectations.  W hen  new  information  challenges  one  of  our  sta tements,  we might  instinctiv ely  dismiss  it  an d  emphasize  the  old  information  that supported  it.  W e  want  to  be  consistent  with  what  we  said.  Changing  our minds  becomes  increasingly  dif ficult.  W e  witness  how ,  say ,  pe ople  label  a politician  a  “flip-flopper”  instead  of  “intelligent”  when  they  change  their position  in  response  to  the  facts ,  and  our  fear  of  the  social  implications  of changing our minds continues to grow . Inertia  a lso  prev ents  us  from  doi ng  hard  things.  The  longer  we  avoid  the hard  thing  we  k now  we  should  do,  the  harder  it  becomes  to  d o.  A voiding conflict  is  comfortable  and  easy .   The  longer  we  avoid  the  conflict,  however , the  more   necess ary  it  becomes  to  continue  avoiding  it.  What  starts  out  as avoiding  a  small  but  dif ficult  c onversation  quickly  grows  into  avoiding  a lar ge  and  seemingly  impossible  one.  The  weight  of  what  we  avoid eventually af fects our relationship. Groups  create  inertia  of  their  own.  They  tend  to  value  consistency  over ef fectiveness,  an d  reward  people  for  maintaining  the  status  quo.  Inertia makes  deviating  from  group  norms  dif ficult.  The  threat  of  standing  out  in  a negative  way  too  often  keeps  people  in  line.  As  a  result,  grou p  dynamics end up favoring people who don’ t deviate from the defaults. Group  inertia  is  partly  respons ible  for  why  a  friend  of  mine,  and  I suspect  a  host  o f  others,  got  mar ried  in  the  first  place.  According  to  him,  in hindsight, “All the signs were there that it might not work out, but it seemed like  a  lot  to  sta rt  over  with  someone  new ,  and  everyone  aro und  us  was getting engaged, so that’ s what we did.” The  influence  of  inertia  isn ’ t  just  troubling  in  our  w ork  and relationships,  it  can  also  be  bad  for  our  health.  In  1910,  America’ s  leading expert  on  industrial  toxicology ,   Alice  Hamilton,  was  appointed  to  head  a survey  o n  industrial  illness  in  th e  state  of  Illinois.  Over  the  next  few  years, she  provided  definitive  evidence  of  the  dangers  of  lead  exposure  in  the workplace  and  of  lead-tainted  exhaust  fumes  from  automobiles.  But  despite the  evidence,  General  Motors  and  other  car  manufacturers  continued producing  lead-f ueled  vehicles.  It  wasn’ t  until  the  1980s  that  the   US  finally banned  leaded  fuel.  Even  today ,  lead  continues  to  be  used  for  other applications, despite the availability of nontoxic options at a similar price. [4] Inertia  k eeps  us  doing  things  tha t  don’ t  get  us  what  we  want.  It  operates in  our  subconscious  lar gely  undetected  until  its  ef fects  are  too  hard  to counter .  Later  I’ll  discuss  more  examples  of  the  inertia  default  at  work  and how  to  combat  it.  For  the  time  b eing  keep  the  following  in  mind :  if  you  find yourself  biting  your  tongue  in  group  situations,  if  you  find  yourself  or  your team  resisting  change  or  continuing======================================================== mistakes.  The  world  doesn’ t  st op  just  because  you  made  a  mistake.  Life goes  on,  and  you  need  to  go  on  too.  Y ou  can’ t  simply  throw  yo ur  hands  up and  walk  away .  There  are  o ther  decisions  to  make,  other  things  to accomplish,  and  hopefully  you  won’ t  repeat  that  kind  of  mistake  in  the future. Everyone  makes  mistakes  because  everyone  has  limitations.  Even  you. T rying  t o  avoid  responsibility  for  your  decisions,  your  actions,  or  their outcomes,  though,  is  tantamount  to  pretending  you  don’ t  have  limitations. One  thin g  that  sets  exceptional   people  apart  from  the  crowd  is  how  they handle mistakes and whether they learn from them and do better as a result. Mistakes  presen t  a  choice:  whether  to  update  your  ideas,  or  ignore  the failures  they’ve  produced  and  k eep  believing  what  you’ve  always  believed. More than a few of us choose the latter . The  biggest  mistake  people  make  typically  isn’ t  their  initial  mistake.  It’ s the  mist ake  of  trying  to  cover  u p  and  avoid  responsibility  for  it.  The  first mistake is expensive; the second one costs a fortune. My  kids  learned  this  the  hard  way .  One  day ,  I  came  home  to  find  a  weird piece  of  broken  glass  on  the  floor .  I  held  it  up  and  asked  what  had happened,  and  they  pleaded  igno rance.  When  I  opened  the  garba ge,  though, and  mov ed  a  sheet  of  paper  that  seemed  to  have  been  carefully  placed  on top,  I  found  the  remains  of  a  shattered  vase.  I  gave  my  kid s  one  final opportunity  to  change  their  story .  W ith  all  the  confidence  preteens  could muster ,  they  stuck  to  it.  Whe n  the  consequences  came,  it  wasn’ t  for breaking the vase, it was for lying. There  ar e  three  problems  with  covering  up  mistakes.  The  first is that you can’ t  learn  if  you  ignore  your  mistakes.  The  second  is  that  hiding  them becomes a habit. The third is that the cover -up makes a bad situation worse. Admitting  error  and  correcting  course  is  a  time-saver  that  empowers  you to  avoid   making  more  mistakes  in  the  future.  However ,  mistakes  also provide  rare  opportunities  for  ge tting  closer  to  the  kind  of  person  you  want to  be,  should  y ou  choose  to  heed  their  lessons.  Use  those  o pportunities wisely! Don’ t squander them. The  four   steps  to  handling  mistakes  more  ef fectively  are  as  follows:  (1) accept  responsib ility ,  (2)  learn  from  the  mistake,  (3)  commit  to  doing  better , and (4) repair the damage as best you can. Step 1: Accept Responsibility If  you’v e  taken  command  of  your  life,  you  need  to  acknowledge  any contribution  you ’ve  made  to  a  mistake  and  take  responsibility  for  what happens  afterward.  Even  if  the  mistake  isn’ t  entirely  your  fa ult,  it’ s  still your problem, and you still have a role to play in handling it. When  m istakes  happen,  the  emotion  default  works  hard  to  usurp  control over  the  situation.  It  will  take  over  if  you  let  it.  This  is  the  opposite  of taking  c ommand,  leaving  your  life’ s  direction  up  to  an  emotional  whim.  It’ s essential  to  keep  your  emotions  in  check.  If  you  haven’ t  worked  on  building that  stre ngth,  the n  there’ s  not  much  you  can  do.  That’ s  why  it’ s  important  to practice continually . Step 2: Learn from the Mistake T ake  tim e  to  reflect  on  what  yo u  contributed  to  the  mistake,  b y  exploring the  various  thoughts,  feelings,  and  actions  that  got  you  here.  If  it’ s  an emer gency ,  and  you  don’ t  have   time  to  reflect  at  the  moment,  be  sure  to come  back  to  it .  If  you  don’ t  identify  the  problem’ s  causes,  a fter  all,  you can’ t  fix  them.  And  if  you  can’ t  fix  them,  you  can’ t  do  better  in   the  future. Instead, you’ll be doomed to repeat the same mistake over and over . If  you  reach  this  stage  and  you   find  yourself  blaming  other  p eople  or saying  things  like,  “This  isn’ t  fa ir!”  or  “Why  did  this  happen  to  me?”  then you  hav en’ t  acce pted  responsibi lity  for  the  mistake.  Y ou  need  to  go  back  to Step 1. Step 3: Commit to Doing Better Formulate  a  plan  for  doing  be tter  in  the  future.  It  could  be  a  matter  of building  a  strength  like  greater  self-accountability  or  greater  self- confidence.  Or  it  could  be  a  ma tter  of  installing  a  safeguard  like  my  friend and  cow orker  d id  when  he  rea lized  he’d  been  failing  to  see  things  from other people’ s points of view . Either way , you need to make a plan for doing better  in  the  future,  and  follow  through  on  that  plan.  Only  then  will  you  be able  to  change  h ow  you  do  things,  and  avoid  repeating  the  mis takes  of  the past. Step 4: Repair the Damage as Best Y ou Can======================================================== it.  As  long  as  it  advances  to  the  objective  withi n  the  limits they’ve set, they’re satisfied. Poor  lea ders  insist  that  everything  must  be  done  their  way ,  which ultimately  demoralizes  their  team  and  undermines  both  loyalty  and creativity—exactly the opposite of commander ’ s intent. F A I L - S A F E :  T ie your hands to keep your execution on track. Ulysses  used  trip  wires  and  com mander ’ s  intent  to  safeguard  his  decision. He  also  had  the  crew  tie  his  hands—a  final  execution  fail-safe  to  ensure  he followed  through  with  his  decision,  and  the  reason  this  kind  of  safeguard  is known as a  Ulysses pact . T ying  your  hands  amounts  to  d if ferent  things  in  dif ferent  contexts.  If you’re  dieting,  tying  your  hands  might  mean  ridding  your  home  of  all  junk food  so  there’ s  nothing  to  tempt  you.  If  you’re  investing,  it  m ight  mean creating  automa ted  deposits  each  month.  If  you’re  climbing  Everest,  tying your  han ds  migh t  mean  securing  an  agreement  from  everyone  that  the  team will turn around if they don’ t reach the halfway point by a certain time. Whatever  decision  you’re  facing ,  ask  yourself,  “Is  there  a  way  to  make sure  I  will  stick  to  the  path  I’ve  decided  is  best?”  By  thinking  th rough  your options,  and  precommitting  to  c ourses  of  action,  you  free  up  space  to  tackle other problems. Even  if  we’re  w aiting  as  long  as  possible  to  decide,  we  no w  know exactly  what  to  focus  on  and  do   when  the  time  comes  to  make  our  decision. W e’ve  set  our  trip  wires,  we’ve  empowered  people  to  act  on  them,  and we’ve  tied  our  hands  so  that  we  can’ t  undo  all  our  good  work  in  a  moment of stress. OceanofPDF .com CHAPTER 4.6 L e a r n   f r o m   Y o u r   D e c i s i o n s I F   Y O U ’ R E   A   K N O W L E D  G  E   W O R K E R ,   Y O U   P R O D U  C  E   D E  C  I S I O N S . [1]   T H A T ’ S   Y O U R   J O B . The  qua lity  of  your  decisions  eventually  determines  how  far  you  go  and how  fas t  you  get  there.  If  you  learn  to  make  great  decisions  c onsistently , you’ll quickly move past the people whose decisions are merely good. No  one  is  smart  enough  to  make  great  decisions  without  learning  first, though.  Great  decision-makers  h ave  mastered  the  ability  to  lear n  both  from their  mistakes  and  from  their  successes.  It’ s  that  ability  that  sets  them  apart. It  en ables  them  to  repeat  their  successes  and  avoid  repeating  th eir  failures. Unless  y ou  develop  that  ability  yourself,  you  won’ t  improve  your  decision- making process over time. A  few  years  ago,  a  firm  engaged   me  to  help  them  improve  the  q uality  of their  decisions.  As  a  first  step,  we  needed  to  find  out  where  th ey  were  at. W e  star ted  by  trying  to  answe r  a  single  question:  When  their  decision- makers  e xpected  a  particular  result,  how  often  did  that  result  happen  for  the reasons they thought it would? What  we  discovered  shocked  them:  Their  decision-makers  were  right only  about  20  percent  of  the  time.  Most  of  the  time  when  som ething  that they  anticipated  actually  happened,  it  didn’ t  happen  for  the  reasons  they thought  it  would.  Their  success,  in  other  words,  wasn’ t  due  to  insight  or ef fort  or   skill.  It  was  more  luck  than  skill.  This  news  was  a  b low  to  their egos.  They  thought  that  the  successes  they  enjoyed  resulted  lar gely  from their  abi lities,  bu t  the  numbers  t old  a  dif ferent  story .  They  were   like  people getting lucky at roulette and attributing their success to having a “system.” The  story  illustrates  a  psycho logical  phenomenon  we’ve  discussed before:  self-serving  bias ,  the  tendency  to  evaluate  things  in  ways  that enhance  our  self-image.  When   we  succeed  at  something,  we  tend  to attribute  our  success  to  our  ability  or  ef fort.  By  contrast,  when  we  fail  at something,  we  tend  to  attribute   our  failure  to  external  factors .  Basically , heads  I’m  right.  T ails,  I’m  not  w rong.  If  you  want  to  get  better ,  you  have  to rewrite the faulty narratives. Self-serving  bias  gets  in  the  way  of  learning  from  your  decisions  and improving  your   process.  Our  ego  default  wants  us  to  think   that  we’re smarter  than  we  are  and  tells  us   that  we  work  harder  and  know  more  than we  actua lly  do.  The  overconfide nce  that  the  ego  demon  inspires  prevents  us from  ex amining  our  decisions   with  a  critical  eye.  It  keeps  us  from distinguishing  sk ill  from  luck—what’ s  in  our  control  from  what  isn’ t.  If  you get  t rapped  by  th e  demon,  you’ll  never  learn  from  your  decisions  and  never get better at making them in the future. The======================================================== from  hard  experience  when  your  defaults  tend to  overr ide  your  decision-making.  The  defaults  prevent  us  from  seeing what’ s  a ctually  happening  and  from  responding  in  ways  aligned  with  our best self-image. W e’ve  already  discussed  setting  automatic  rules  such  as  Kahneman’ s resolution  to  not  say  yes  to  things  on  the  phone,  and  avoiding  making important  decisions  under  unfavorable  conditions.  There  are  other  ef fective safeguarding  procedures,  though,  that  also  force  you  to  slow  down  in  the moment,  creatin g  a  pocket  of  time  in  which  to  think  more  clearly  about  any situation.  These   procedures  make  us  take  a  step  back  and  ask,  “What  am  I trying  to   achieve?”  and  “Is  this  moving  me  closer  to  that  or  fur ther  away?” These  seem  like  basic  questions,  but  they’re  often  for gotten  in  the  heat  of the moment. Checklists,  for  instance,  of fer  a  simple  way  to  override  your  defaults. Pilots  go  through  a  preflight  checklist  every  time  they  fly .  Sur geons  go through  preoperative  checklists  every  time  they  operate.  Y ou  might  have  a packing  checklis t  every  time  you   travel.  In  each  of  these  cases,  t he  checklist acts  as  a  safegu ard,  forcing  us  t o  slow  down  whatever  we’re  doing  and  go back  to  basics:  “What  am  I  tryin g  to  accomplish?  And  what  are   the  things  I need  to  accomplish  it?”  Questi ons  like  these  are  the  guardra ils  that  will keep you on the road to success. [*] Safeguard Strategy 5: Shifting Y our Perspective Each  of   us  sees  things  only  fro m  a  particular  point  of  view .  Nobody  can possibly  see  everything.  That  do esn’ t  mean,  however ,  that  we  ca n’ t  shift  the way we see things in any given situation. In  physi cs,  a  frame  of  reference  is  a  set  of  coordinates  for  observing events.  Dif feren t  observers  occupy  dif ferent  frames  of  reference,  and  what’ s visible  f rom  one  isn’ t  necessarily  visible  from  another .  For  example,  you occupy  o ne  frame  of  reference  if   you’re  seated  in  a  traveling  train  car ,  while I  o ccupy  a  dif ferent  one  if  I’m  standing  at  the  station,  watchin g  your  train pass  by .  W ithin  your  frame  of  re ference,  you  and  the  bench  on  which  you’re sitting  are  stationary .  From  mine,  though,  you  and  the  bench  are  both moving fast. Imagine  now  that  it  were  possible  for  you  to  shift  your  f rame  of reference.  What   if,  for  instance,   I  were  live  streaming  the  approach  of  your train  to  you?  Y ou  would  then  be   able  to  see  yourself  and  your  po sition  from my  perspective,   giving  you  more  information  about  your  situation  that wasn’ t  v isible  fr om  your  frame  of  reference.  Suppose  your  trai n  were  on  a collision  course  with  an  obstacl e  on  the  tracks  ahead  that  was  only  visible from  my   frame  of  reference.  W ithin  your  view ,  everything  woul d  seem  fine. Y ou  wou ldn’ t  know  you  were  h eaded  toward  disaster .  Shifting  your  frame of  reference  and  seeing  things  from  my  perspective  would  give  you  crucial information and enable you to take steps to avoid a catastrophe. What  applies  in  the  train  example  applies  to  many  other  cases.  While you  mig ht  be  seated  on  your  couch  reading  this  book  and  not  m oving  at  all, from  the  sun’ s  point  of  view ,  you’re  moving  at  sixty-seven  tho usand  miles per  hour  around  it.  Having  an  outside  perspective  on  your  situa tion  allows you  to  see  more   of  what’ s  actu ally  happening.  Changing  your  perspective changes what you see. Shifting  your  frame  of  reference  is  a  powerful  safeguard  against  blind spots.  E arlier ,  w e  saw  that  Mich ael  Abrashof f  was  able  to  turn   around  the performance  of  the  USS   Benfold   by  shift ing  his  frame  of  reference.  Rather than  co ntinuing  to  see  things  from  the  Benfold ’ s  established  frame  of reference—a  frame  in  which  it  was  normal  for  of ficers  to  treat  sailors  as second-class  citizens—Abrashof f  shifted  his  frame  of  reference  and  looked at  thing s  instead  from  the  per spective  of  ordinary  sailors  and  ordinary fairness. I  on ce  had  a  coworker  who  was  also  a  friend.  One  day  he  walked  into my  of fic e  with  some  news.  “I  fi gured  out  what  I’m  doing  wrong,”  he  said. “I’m  so  busy  trying  to  prove  to  everyone  I’m  right  that  I  can’ t  see  the  world from their point of view .” The  problem  wasn’ t  that  he  wasn’ t  smart.  He  was.  It  wasn’ t  that  he didn’ t  work  hard.  He  did.  The  problem  was  that  he  couldn’ t  rel ate  to  other people  because  he  hadn’ t  even  made  any  ef fort  to  see  things  through  their eyes.  Now  he’d  come  to  realize  it  himself  and======================================================== problem-solution firewall,  130–32 test of time,  133–34 in solution-exploring stage,  145–50 Both-And options,  148–50 imagining one option as of f the table,  146–47 sandbox metaphor ,  88–89 Schopenhauer , Arthur ,  35 Scrooge, Ebenezer ,  225–26 ,  228 ,  229 Seattle Seahawks,  213–14 Second-Level Thinking Principle,  139–45 self-accountability ,  41 ,  43–55 ,  71–73 blame and,  44 ,  48 ,  52 ,  53 ,  1 13 ,  246 complaining and,  52 excuses and,  44–47 and responses making things better or worse,  50–51 responsibility and,  43 ,  44 ,  48–50 ,  53 ,  1 15–17 ,  158 ,  223 ,  246 victimhood and,  52–55 self-confidence,  17–18 ,  41 ,  62–70 ,  71–73 ,  95 ego vs.,  63 honesty and,  66–68 and how you talk to yourself,  63–65 and wrong side of right,  67–70 self-control,  41 ,  59–61 ,  71–73 ,  95 self-defense and territoriality ,  8 ,  10 ,  39 ,  46–47 ,  93 self-image,  46–47 ,  50 self-knowledge,  41 ,  56–58 ,  63 ,  71–73 defaults and,  58 self-preservation,  9 ,  10 ,  39 ,  48 n,  93 self-serving bias,  48 ,  1 13 ,  212 Seneca,  82 ,  84 ,  87 ,  137 ,  138 ,  234 ,  240 Shakespeare, W illiam,  59 Sharp, Isadore,  149 Shippen, Peggy ,  19 Shopify ,  85 ,  162 Slovic, Paul,  190 social comparison,  226–27 social default,  10–1 1 ,  23–28 ,  126 ,  127 ,  131 ,  134 ,  156 ,  158 ,  183 ,  196 ,  222 and deviating from established practices,  25–28 resisting,  72–73 social hierarchies,  9 ,  10 ,  18 ,  21 ,  30 n,  39 ,  93 social pressure,  23–24 ,  95 solution-exploring stage,  120 ,  135–54 ,  155 Bad Outcome Principle and,  138–39 ,  143 opportunity costs and,  150–54 Opportunity Cost Principle in,  152 3-Lens Principle in,  152–54 safeguarding of,  145–50 Both-And options,  148–50 imagining one option as of f the table,  146–47 Second-Level Thinking Principle and,  139–45 separating problem-defining phase from,  130–32 3+ Principle and,  146 Stakes of Diplomacy , The  (Lippmann),  23 standards,  74–79 ,  88 low , reasons for ,  78 low , smart people with,  76–78 Stockdale, James,  135–36 Stoics,  8 Stop, FLOP , Know Principle,  190–92 strength(s),  41 in action,  71–73 building,  39–41 ,  95 knowledge about,  56 ,  58 stress,  102 Stutman, Randall,  x successes, learning from,  21 1 successful, appearing vs. being,  17–20 Super Bowl XLIX,  213–14 Syrus, Publilius,  49 T T aleb, Nassim,  167 n,  199 T ar geting Principle,  164–65 T emple of Apollo at Delphi,  56 Thiokol, Morton,  157 30  Lessons for Living  (Pillemer),  231 3-Lens Principle,  152–54 3+ Principle,  146 time,  xv ,  232 test of,  133–34 trade-of fs,  150–51 T ransparency Principle,  217–18 trip wires,  206–8 ,  210 T uft & Needle,  172 tying your hands,  206 ,  210 U Ulysses,  205–6 ,  210 Undoing Pr oject, The  (Lewis),  187 Urban, T im,  167 V victimhood,  52–55 V ietnam W ar ,  135 virtue signaling,  24–25 W W alsh, Bill,  76 n wanting what matters,  221–23 ,  230 ,  243 W ashington, Denzel,  87 W ashington, Geor ge,  19 ,  20 weaknesses,  41 ,  93–100 acquired,  94 ,  95 blind spots,  95–96 ,  1 1 1 ,  172 managing,  96–98 on USS  Benfold ,  98–100 ,  1 1 1 inbuilt,  94 ,  95 knowledge about,  56 ,  58 ,  63 ,  93–100 managing,  91–92 ,  96–98 safeguards for protecting yourself from,  see   safeguards two ways of managing,  95 W eise, Lori,  129–30 willpower ,  36 ,  39 ,  103 ,  246 W ilson, Russell,  214 wisdom,  230 ,  235 ,  240 ,  242 ,  243 W ittgenstein, Ludwig,  132 W olfe, Josh,  139 W orld W ar II,  170–71 wrong, doubling down when,  32– 34 A   B    C    D   E   F    G    H   I   J   K   L   M   N   O   P   Q   R   S   T   U   V   W   X Y   Z OceanofPDF .com About the Author Shane  Parrish   is   an  entrepren eur  and  wisdom  seeker  behind  the  popular website  Farnam  Street,  where  he  focuses  on  turning  timeless  insights  into action.

In  fact, while  job  descriptions  are======================================================== confusing  fact  with  o pinion.  By trying on all the glasses, you see what others miss. When you’re getting information from other people, you need to keep an open mind. That means withholding your own judgment as long as possible. People  often  undermine  the  information-gathering  process  by  subjecting others  to  their  judgments,  beliefs,  and  perspective.  The  point  is n’ t  to  ar gue or  d isagree,  however .  Judging  p eople  and  telling  them  they’re  wrong  only shuts  th em  down  and  prevents  a  free  flow  of  information.  When  you’re gathering  information,  your  job  is  to  see  the  world  through  other  people’ s eyes.  Y ou’re  trying  to  understan d  their  experience  and  how  the y  processed it.  Y ou  can  learn  valuable  information  even  when  you  don’ t  agree  with  their view  of  the  world.  Just  ask  que stions,  keep  your  thoughts  to  y ourself,  and remain curious about other perspectives. S A F E  G  U A R D :   W hen  you  get  inf ormation  from  other  people,  ask  questions  that  yield detailed answers. Don’t ask people what they think; instead, ask them  how  they think. If  you  ask  people  what  to  do  in  a  given  situation,  you  might  ge t  the  correct answer ,  but  you  haven’ t  learned  anything.  Say  a  local  government  task force  needs  to  h ire  a  software  developer  for  a  project,  but  they  have  no experience  doin g  so  and  don’ t  know  what  to  look  for .  Person  A   on  the  task force  goes  to  a  developer  friend  and  asks,  “Whom  should  I  hire  for  this project?”  Person   B  does  the  same  but  instead  says,  “I’m  hiring  a  software developer ,  and  I’d  like  to  learn  from  your  experiences.  What  skills  matter and  whi ch  ones  can  be  learned  on  the  job?  Why?  Where  do  I  f ind  the  best people? How do I test these skills?” And so on. Person  B  might  not  have  a  recommendation  within  t he  first conversation,  bu t  I’d  give  it  ten-to-one  odds  that  they  find  a  bett er  candidate in  the  end.  The  reason:  Person  B  is  asking  about  the  principle s  that  guide decision-making  in  this  domain,  not  details  about  the  specific  ca se.  They’re asking others about their earned knowledge and making it their own. Our  goa l  in  decision-making  is  not  just  to  gather  information,  but  to gather  informat ion  relevant  to  our  decision.  That  requires  more  than building  an  inventory  of  data  points;  it  requires  understanding  t he  why  and how  beh ind  those  data  points—the  principles  that  good  decision-makers  use in this area. Getting  at  those  principles  requ ires  asking  the  right  kinds  of  questions. There are three I’d recommend: Question  1:   Wh at  are  the  variables  you’d  use  to  make  this  decision  if you were in my shoes? How do those variables relate to one another? Question  2:   What  do  you  know  about  this  problem  that  I  (or  other people)  don’ t?  What  can  you  see  based  on  your  experience  that someone  without  your  experienc e  can’ t?  What  do  you  know  that  most people miss? Question 3:   Wh at  w ould  be  your  process  for  deciding  if  you  were  in  my shoes?  H ow  wo uld  you  go  abou t  doing  it?  (Or:  How  would  you  tell your mother/friend to go about doing it?) Notice  how  dif ferent  these  qu estions  are  from  the  typical,  “Here’ s  my problem.  What  should  I  do?”  Remember:  the  questions  you  ask  help  to determine the quality of the information you get. Getting Accurate Information from Experts W e’ve  ta lked  ab out  the  importance  of  getting  high-fidelity  information.  The second  principle  for  getting  accurate  information  is  getting  high-expertise information: T H E   H I E X   P R I N  C  I P L E :   Get  high-expertise  (HiEx)  information,  which  comes  both  from people  with  a  lot  of  knowledge  and/or  experience  in  a  specific  area,  and  from  people with knowledge and experience in many areas. When  so meone  close  to  the  pro blem  isn’ t  available  to  you,  look   for  people who  recently  solved  a  similar  problem.  The  word  “recent”  is  an  important nuance  here.  When  you  want  specific  advice  from  an  expe rt,  look  for someone  who  recently  solved  t he  problem  you’re  trying  to  so lve.  Asking someone  who  solved  your  problem  twenty  years  ago  how  they  did  it  is  not likely  to  of fer  s pecific  and  ef fective  insights.  Y ou  want  a  current  expert— and no, I don’ t mean the talking heads on TV . They’re rarely actual experts. Experts  can  increase  the  accura cy  of  your  information  and  decr ease  the time  it  takes  to  g et  it.  Getting  ev en  one  expert’ s  advice  can  cut  through  a  lot of confusion and help you quickly formulate and/or eliminate options. I  l earned   the  value  of  expert  adv ice  firsthand  when  I  began  coding  at======================================================== first is this: T H E   O P P O R T U N I T Y -  C  O S T   P R I N  C  I P L E :    C  onsider   what  opportunities  you’re  forgoing  when you choose one option over another . The second principle is closely related: T H E   3 - L E N S   P R I N  C  I P L E :   V iew  opportunity  costs  through  these  three  lenses:  (1) Compared with what? (2) And then what? (3) At the expense of what? [ * ] For  mos t  of  us,  the  first  lens  is  our  default  because  the  costs  are  direct  and visible.  For  instance,  think  about  purchasing  a  car .  If  you’r e  like  most people,  you  can  narrow  the  decision  down  to  a  few  options  pre tty  quickly: “The  T e sla  will  look  extra  cool  and  be  fuel  ef ficient,  but  will  it  be  good  for road  trips?  A  BMW  looks  grea t  and  has  more  car go  space,  but  is  a  gas- powered  vehicle  behind  the  curve?  Should  I  get  the  car  that’ s  $42,000  or $37,000?”  When  we  compare  the  two  models,  we  focus  o n  what  the additional  $5,000  gets  us  in  terms  of  features,  and  for get  to  view   the  choice through the other two lenses. When  we  view  the  choice  through  the  second  lens,  we  cons ider  the additional  costs  that  will  arise  af ter  we’ve  selected  an  option—for example, how  we’ ll  need  to  char ge  the  T e sla,  its  anticipated  yearly  operating  costs,  its durability ,  and  how  many  long  drives  we’ll  go  on  annually .  When  we  view the  choi ce  throu gh  the  third  lens,  we  consider  what  else  we  could  do  with that  $5,0 00.  Are   we  giving  up  a  family  vacation?  What  about  the  dividends we  could  get  if  we  invested  it?  What  about  the  savings  if  we  pay  down  the mortgage?  Wha t  about  a  rainy- day  fund  in  case  we  lose  our  jo b?  Looking through all three lenses helps us make a better decision. Money  is  not  th e  only  opportunity  cost  to  consider .  It’ s  just  the  most direct  and  visible,  and  for  that  reason  people  tend  to  focus  on  it.  They convince  themselves  that  what’ s   easy  to  see  is  all  that  matters.  But  in  many cases,  the  real  value  to  thinking   through  opportunity  costs  is  to   understand the indirect hidden costs. T ime  is  not  as  e asy  to  see  as  money  but  it’ s  just  as  important.  Suppose your  fam ily  is  growing,  and  it’ s  time  to  move.  Relocating  to  the  suburbs will  get  you  a  bigger  house  w ith  a  bigger  yard  for  the  kids,  and  it’ll  be cheaper  than  buying  a  smaller  duplex  downtown  with  a  backyar d  the  size  of a  po stage  stamp.  In  this  situation,  many  people  think  of  how  m uch  money they’ll  save  by  moving  to  the  suburbs,  and  get  caught  up  in  the  happy thought  of  walking  across  the  th reshold  of  their  new  home  for  the  first  time. But  this   way  of  thinking  views   the  situation  through  only  the  first  lens.  It doesn’ t  disclose   the  less  obviou s  costs  of  living  in  the  suburbs.  When  we apply the other two lenses, we start seeing those costs more clearly . Let’ s  ap ply  the  second  lens.  Suppose  you  buy  that  house  in  the  suburbs. Ask  yourself,  “And  then  what? ”  How  will  your  circumstances  change  if you  choose  that  option?  For  on e  thing,  your  commute  might  b e  dif ferent. Perhaps  it  goes  from  a  predictable  half  hour  each  way  to  an  unpredictable hour and a half. Now  app ly  the  third  lens.  Ask  y ourself,  “At  the  expense  of  what ?”  What are  you  not  going  to  be  able  to  do  because  you’re  spending  an  extra  two  to three  hours  a  da y  in  transit?  W ill  you  spend  less  time  with  your  kids  and your  par tner?  W hat  will  you  miss  out  on  by  not  being  with  them?  W ill  you be  able  to  spend  the  commute  learning  a  new  language  or  re ading  some great  literature,  or  will  you  hav e  to  deal  with  the  frustration  and  stress  of driving?  Over  time,  which  option  is  better  for  your  mental  and  physical health? T I P :   I f  you’re  having  trouble  assessing  opportunity  costs,  it  sometimes  helps  to  p ut  a price  on  them.  For  example,  putting  a  price  on  those  extra  two  to  three  hours  a  day spent commuting will make them more visible and easier to assess. Keep  in  mind,  though,  that  pricing  things  whose  costs  are  dif ficult  to  assess is  just  a  tool.  Like  any  tool,  it’ s  useful  for  some  jobs,  but  not  useful  for  all. It’ s  a n  attempt  to   make  the  invisible  visible.  Sometimes  there  ar e  important factors  that  you  simply  can’ t  put  a  price  on  without  grossly  distorting  the trade-of fs.  As  Einstein  is  though t  to  have  said,  “Not  everything   that  can  be counted  counts,  and  not  everyth ing  that  counts  can  be  counted .”  W e’ll  see later  on  that  assessing  these  “priceless”  factors  is======================================================== sandboxes can  remove  the  downside  of  the  mistakes  you  inevitably  make  when practicing.  At  the  intelligence  agency ,  we’d  always  practice  and  rehearse before  an  operation  in  an  environment  in  which  it  was  safe  to  fail.  W e treated  the  practice  as  if  it  were  the  operation  itself;  we’d  do  a ll  the  things we  planned  on  doing  during  the  operation,  and  tried  to  predict  and  respond to  all  the  things  that  could  conceivably  happen.  If  something  didn’ t  go  as planned, we would adapt. And sometimes we’d fail. Failing in that sandbox, though,  provided  a  learning  opportunity  with  few  real-world  consequences, whereas failing in a real operation could cost people their  lives.

Another  part is managing the things you can’t—your vulnerabilities or weaknesses. Think  aga in  of  the  c omputer  analogy  we  discussed  earlier .  Y ou  have  the  power to  ch ange  your  pro gramming,  at  least  to  some  extent.  In  some  cases,  you  can rewrite  your  existing  algorithms,  reprogramming  how  you  respond  to,  say ,  emotion or  social  pressure  or  threats  to  your  eg o.  Rewriting  those  algorithms  is  a  great  way to build strength. But  s ometimes  there  are  harmful  algor ithms  you  can’t  rewrite.  Y ou  can’t  change your  biolo gical  instincts,  the  inborn  tendencies  that  resist  any  attempt  to  ch ange them.  Jus t  because  you  can’t  chang e  them,  however ,  doesn’t  mean  you  can’t manage  th em.  Doin g  so  is  merely  a  m atter  of  programming  new  subroutines  into your  life  that  help  mitigate  or  contain  the  harmful  ef fects.  Adding  those  subroutines is a way of managing weakness. ⦁ OceanofPDF .com CHAPTER 3.1 K n o w i n g   Y o u r   W e a k n e s s e s W E   A L L   H A V E   W E A K N E S S E S ,  M A N Y   O F   W H I  C  H   A R E   B U I L T   I N T O   O U R   B I O L O  G  Y .  W E are,  for   instance,  vulnerable  to  being  hungry ,  thirsty ,  fatigued,  sleep deprived, emotional, distracted, or stressed. All of these conditions can push us  toward  reacting  instead  of  thinking  clearly ,  and  blind  us  to  the  deciding moments of our lives. Each  of   us  also  has  a  limited  perspective  on  things:  we  can  see  and know  only  so  much.  In  addition,  we  have  inbuilt  tendencies  to  form judgments  and  opinions  even  in  the  absence  of  knowledge.  W e’ ve  seen  that our  instincts  for  self-preservation,  group  membership,  hie rarchy ,  and territoriality  can  all  trigger  bad  judgments  that  harm  us  and   the  people around us. Some  of  our  we aknesses  aren’ t  built  into  our  biology;  instead  they  are acquired through habit, and stay with us by force of inertia. Bad  habits  are  e asy  to  acquire  when  there  is  a  delay  between  ac tion  and consequence.  If  you  eat  a  choco late  bar  or  skip  a  workout  today ,  you’re  not going  to  suddenly  go  from  healthy  to  unhealthy .  W ork  late  and  miss  dinner with  your  family  a  couple  nights,  and  it  won’ t  damage  your  relationship.  If you  spen d  today  on  social  media  instead  of  doing  work,  you’re  not  going  to get  fired.  However ,  these  choi ces  can  end  up  becoming  hab its  through repetition and accumulate into disaster . The  formula  for  failure  is  a  few  small  errors  consistently  repea ted.  Just because  the  results  aren’ t  immediately  felt  doesn’ t  mean  consequences aren’ t  co ming.  Y ou  are  smart  en ough  to  know  the  potential  resu lts;  you  just don’ t necessarily realize when they’re coming. While good choices repeated make time your friend, bad ones make it your enemy . [*] Examples of Inbuilt W eaknesses Hunger Thirst Fatigue Sleep deprivation Emotion Distraction Stress Limitations in perspective Cognitive biases Examples of Acquired W eaknesses Acting on emotional impulse Doing less than you’re capable of Refusing to start something because of fear Seeing only your own point of view Coasting on your talent without hard work Whatever  our  weaknesses  and  whatever  their  origins,  the  defaults  will handily  take  command  of  our  lives  if  we  don’ t  manage  them.  Moreover , we’re often unaware when they do. The T wo W ays of Managing W eakness There  are  two  w ays  to  manage  your  weaknesses.  The  first  is  to  build  your strengths,  which  will  help  you  overcome  the  weaknesses  you’ve  acquired. The  second  is  to  implement  saf eguards,  which  will  help  you  m anage  any weaknesses  you’re  having  trouble  overcoming  with  strength  alone.  In addition,  safeguards  help  us  manage  weaknesses  that  are  impossible  to======================================================== that time. When  you’ve  finished  ordering   these  two  criteria,  go  to  the  next  pair . Move  fr om  top  to  bottom,  make  your  criteria  battle  one  another  for  priority , and add the quantities that matter to you along the way . When  people  do  this  exercise,  they  often  look  at  a  pair  of  criteria  and think,  “I  don’ t  necessarily  have  to  choose  between  those  two.”   Make  them battle  an yway!  T he  point  isn’ t  really  to  compare  them,  it’ s  to  find  out  which one  is  more  important.  Maybe  in  real  life  you  can  satisfy  bot h  criteria— maybe,  for  instance,  you  can  ge t  a  high  ROI  while  investing  in  a  socially responsible  company ,  or  you  can  get  in  shape  while  still  eating  out  three times  a  week,  or  you  can  buy  a  house  in  a  great  location  that  fits  your budget.  But  often,  when  we  actually  start  pursuing  an  option,  we  find  that we  h ave  to  rank   one  criterion  ab ove  another—even  if  only  slightly .  Most  of the  time,  making  your  criteria  battle  is  about  calibrating  shades  of  gray .  It’ s a  m ental  exercise  that  takes  you  out  of  reactive  mode  and  moves  you toward deliberative thinking. Assigning  quantitative  values  to  your  criteria  often  helps  at  this  point. When  y ou  start  comparing  things  and  thinking  how  much  yo u’ll  pay  for them—and  whether  in  a  currency  of  time,  money ,  collective  brain  power— you  gain   clarity   about  what  ma tters  most  to  you  and  what  doesn’ t.  Y ou’re forced  to   think  in  terms  of  benefits  and  risks,  and  you  start  to  se e  things  you didn’ t  see  before—previously  invisible  costs  become  visible.   For  all  of these  reasons,  making  your  crite ria  battle  moves  you  toward  obj ectivity  and accuracy , and helps reveal what you think is most important. Once  you’ve  settled  on  your  criteria  and  their  order  of  importance,  it’ s time  to  apply  them  to  the  options.  Doing  so  requires  that  you  have information  about  those  options  that  meets  two  conditions:  it’ s  r elevant ,  and it’ s  accurate . Most Information Is Irrelevant When  it  comes  to  getting  information  that’ s  relevant  to  the  decision, remember this: T H E   T A R  G  E T I N  G    P R I N  C  I P L E :   Know  what  you’re  l ooking  for  before  yo u  start  sorting  through the data. If  you  don’ t  kno w  what  you’re  l ooking  for ,  you’re  unlikely  to  find  it,  just  as you’re  u nlikely  to  hit  the  tar get   if  you  don’ t  know  what  you’re  aiming  at. When  you  don’ t  know  what’ s  important,  you  miss  things  that  are  relevant and spend a lot of time on things that are irrelevant. Most  information  is  irrelevant.  Knowing  what  to  ignore—separating  the signal  fr om  the  noise—is  the  key  to  not  wasting  valuable  time.  Think,  for example,  of  investment  decisions.  The  best  investors  know  which  variables probabilistically  govern  the  outc omes,  and  they  pay  attention  to  those.  They don’ t  ignore  everything  else,  b ut  focusing  primarily  on  those  variables allows them to filter massive amounts of information very quickly . People  who  can  quickly  distingu ish  what  matters  from  what  doe sn’ t  gain a huge advantage in a world where the flow of information never stops. Knowing  what  to  ignore  allows  you  to  focus  on  what  matters.  Follow the  exam ple  of  the  best  investors  and  know  the  variables  that  matter  for evaluating the options  befor e  you start sorting through information. Getting Accurate Information from the Source When  it  comes  to  getting  information  that’ s  accurate,  there  are  two principles  you  should  know:  the  HiFi  Principle  and  the  HiEx  Principle.  The first  will  help  you  find  the  best  intel  possible  from  within  any  given situation,  and  the  second  will  help  you  find  the  best  intel  po ssible  from outside of it. T H E   H I F I   P R I N  C  I P L E :   Get  high-fidelity  (HiFi)  information—information  that’ s  close  to  the source and unfiltered by other people’ s biases and interests. The  quality  of  your  decisions  is  directly  related  to  the  quality  of  your thoughts.  The  quality  of  your  thoughts  is  directly  related  to  the  quality  of your information. Many  people  treat  all  sources  o f  information  as  if  they’re  equally  valid. They’re  not.  While  you  might  va lue  getting  everyone’ s  opinion,  that  doesn’ t mean each opinion should be equally weighted or considered. A  lo t  of  the  information  we  consume  is  in  the  form  of  highlights, summaries,  or  distillations.  It’ s   the  illusion  of  knowledge.  W e  learn  the answer but can’ t show our work. Consider  what  happens  when  you  consult  a  nutritionist.

A   F E W   W E E K S later , the world changed forever . Everyone  at  the  agency  suddenly  found  themselves  thrust  into  p ositions and  responsibili ties  they  weren’ t  ready  for .  My  job  involved  constantly figuring  out  how  to  do  things  few  had  even  imagined  possible.  N ot  only  did I  n eed  to  solve  complicated  and  new  problems,  but  people’ s  lives  were  at stake. Failure was not an option. One  night,  I  was   walking  home  at  3:00  a.m.  after  one  of  our  operations. The  outc ome  wasn’ t  what  I  had  hoped  for .  I  knew  I’d  have  to  face  my  boss in the morning and explain what happened and what I’d been thinking when I made the choices I did. Had  I  thought  everything  through  clearly?  W as  there  something  I missed? How was I to know? My thinking would be laid bare for everyone to see and judge. I  w alked   into  my  boss’ s  of fice======================================================== fund amental  problem:  Most   errors  in  judgment  happen  when  we  don’ t know  we’re  supposed  to  be  exercising  judgment.  They  happen  because  our subconscious  is  driving  our  beh aviors  and  cutting  us  out  of  the  process  of determining  wh at  we  should  do.  Y ou  don’ t  consciously  choose  to  ar gue with  you r  partne r ,  but  you  find  yourself  saying  hurtful  things  t hat  can’ t  be unsaid.  Y ou  don’ t  consciously  seek  money  and  status  at  the  expense  of  your family ,  b ut  you  find  yourself  spending  less  and  less  time  with  the  people who  ma tter  mos t  in  your  life.  Y ou  don’ t  consciously  seek  to  defend  your ideas,  but  you  find  yourself  holding  grudges  against  anyone  who  criticizes you. The  key   to  getting  what  you  wan t  out  of  life  is  to  identify  how  the  world works  a nd  to  align  yourself  with  it.  Often  people  think  the  w orld  should work  di f ferently  than  it  does,  a nd  when  they  don’ t  get  the  outcomes  they want,  th ey  try  to  wiggle  out  of   responsibility  by  blaming  other  people  or their  circumstances. [1]   A voiding  responsibility  is  a  recipe  for  misery ,  and the opposite of what it takes to cultivate good judgment. Improving  your  judgment,  it  tur ns  out,  is  less  about  accumulat ing  tools to  enhan ce  your   rationality  and  more  about  implementing  safeguards  that make  th e  desired  path  the  pat h  of  least  resistance.  It’ s  about  designing systems  when  you’re  at  your  best  that  work  for  you  when  you’re  at  your worst.  T hose  systems  don’ t  eliminate  the  defaults,  but  they  do  help  you recognize when they are running the show . Managing  your  defaults  requires  more  than  willpower .  Defaults  operate at  our  subconsc ious  level,  so  o verriding  them  requires  harness ing  equally powerful  forces  that  pull  your  subconscious  in  the  right  direction:  habits, rules,  and  environment.  Overriding  your  defaults  requires  im plementing safeguards  that  render  the  invisible  visible  and  that  prevent  you  from  acting too  soon.  And  it  requires  cultivating  habits  of  mind—accountability , knowledge,  disc ipline,  and  confidence—that  put  you  on  the  right  track  and keep you there. The  sma ll  improvements  you  make  in  judgment  won’ t  be  felt  until  they are  too  lar ge  to   ignore.  Gradually ,  as  the  improvements  accumulate,  you will  not ice  that  less  of  your  tim e  is  spent  fixing  problems  tha t  shouldn’ t exist  in  the  first  place.  Y ou’ll  notice  the  various  parts  of  your  l ife  blending harmoniously  together ,  and  you’ll  notice  that  you  experience  less  stress  and anxiety and more joy . Good judgment can’ t be taught, but it can be  learned.

W======================================================== experiment  by  p eople,  I  am  constantly  surprised.  W e  all know  something   we  could  do  to  improve  our  odds  of  success.  And  we  all know  so mething  we  can  stop  d oing  that  would  also  improve  our  odds  of success. Just  because  I  can’ t  control  all  the  things  I  need  to  do  doesn’ t  mean  I can’ t  con trol  wh en  I  do  them.  The  version  of  me  that  I’d  want  the  film  crew to see focused on what mattered. Using  this  prompt,  I  decided  to   create  space  every  day  to  work  on  the biggest opportunities. I imagined the film crew  watching me make breakfast for  the  kids  and  then  going  to  work.  While  the  crew  would  be  expecting  to see  meetings  and  people  asking  me  for  things,  what  they’d  see  is  no  calls  or meetings  until  lunch  so  I  could  spend  time  working  on  the  most  important opportunity . This is where my no-meetings-before-lunch rule came from. [*] W e’re  ta ught  ou r  whole  lives  to  follow  rules,  and  yet  no  one  ever  told  us about  how  we  c an  create  powerful  rules  that  help  us  get  what  we  want.  I find  it  hard  to  go  to  the  gym  thre e  days  a  week,  so  my  rule  is  I  g o  every  day . I  do   not  feel  like  going  to  the  gym  every  day .  In  fact,  some  days  I  hate  it.  I also  kno w  it’ s  easier  to  follow  my  rule  than  to  break  it.  When   it  comes  to the gym, going every day is easier than going some days. Creating  person al  rules  is  a  powerful  technique  for  protecting  yourself from  yo ur  own  weaknesses  and  limitations.  Sometimes  those   rules  have surprising benefits. Safeguard Strategy 3: Creating Friction Another  safegua rding  strategy  is  to  increase  the  amount  of  ef fort  it  takes  to do  th ings  that  are  contrary  to  your  goals.  I  used  to  find  myself  checking  my email  whenever  I  have  a  second.  I’d  check  it  before  I  got  out  of  bed,  on  the walk home from work, in line at the grocery store. It’ s  easy  to  tell  myself  that  I’m  n ot  the  only  one,  that  everyone  does  this too.  The  dopamine  hit  of  something  new  prevents  many  of  us  from  working on  our  priorities.  It  isn’ t  just  th at  I  was  spending  too  much  time  on  email, though,  it’ s  that  email  could  hijack  my  time  from  what’ s  important.  The scary  thing  is,  I  often  wanted   it   to  tak e  me  away  from  what  I   was  supposed to be doing. Consider a major report I needed to complete early in my career . I would get  to  work  and  rather  than  wr ite  the  report,  which  was  clear ly  the  most important  thing  for  me  to  do,  I’ d  check  my  email.  If  there  was  anything  in my  inbox  that  required  even  a  modicum  of  attention,  I’d  tell  myself  I needed  t o  do  that  before  starting  on  the  report.  And,  of  course,  by  the  time  I was  don e  with  that  first  email,  more  had  come  in  that  needed  attention.  It didn’ t  take  much  to  convince  myself  I  needed  to  do  that  before  I  started. Only  near  the  end  of  the  workday  would  I  finally  sit  down  to  write  the report, mentally exhausted. When  you  step  b ack  and  think  a bout  it  for  a  second,  I  was  giving  one  of the  most  important  things  I  wan ted  to  do  the  worst  of  myself.  Email,  which I  d read  on  the  best  of  days,  was  getting  my  most  ener getic  and  c reative  self. Many  of   us  do  this  with  our  part ners  too.  By  the  time  everything  we  need  to do  over  the  course  of  a  long  day  is  finished,  we’re  exhausted.  And  this  is the time we give to our spouse, the most important person in our lives! If  there  were  a  recipe  for  accum ulated  disaster ,  it  would  be  gi ving  the best  of  ourselve s  to  the  least  important  things  and  the  worst  of  ourselves  to the most important things. The  path  to  breaking  bad  habi ts  is  making  your  desired  beha vior  the default  behavior .  T o  get  on  track  with  the  report,  I  told  my  colleagues  that until  the  report  was  submitted,  I’d  buy  them  all  lunch  if  they  caught  me with  my   email  open  before  1 1:00  a.m.  My  being  competitive  and  not wanting  to  buy  them  lunch  created  enough  friction  to  keep  me  from checking it first thing in the morning. I’d  wor k  free  from  distraction  all  morning.  In  the  afternoon,  I’d  do email, take calls, and attend or conduct meetings. It’ s incredible how much I got done. It’ s  e asy  to  unde restimate  the  role  ease  plays  in  decision-making.  Since behavior  follows  the  path  of  least  resistance,  a  surprisingly  successful approach  is  to  a dd  friction  where  you  find  yourself  doing  things  you  don’ t want to do. Safeguard Strategy 4: Putting in Guardrails Another  safeguarding  strategy  is  to  formulate  operating  procedures  for yourself  because  you  know======================================================== knew  wha t  he  was capable  of  and  he  knew  that  I  knew ,  I  told  him  I  expected  that  out  of  him every time. The standard was clear . I was never disappointed. Why W e Have Low Standards Most  of  the  time  when  we  accept  substandard  work  from  ou rselves,  it’ s because  we  don’ t  really  care  about  it.  W e  tell  ourselves  it’ s  good   enough,  or the  best  we  can  manage  given  our  time  constraints.  But  the  truth  is,  at  least in this particular thing, we’re not committed to excellence. When  we  accept  substandard  work  from  others,  it’ s  for  the  same  reason: we’re  not  all  in.  When  you’re   committed  to  excellence,  you  don’ t  let anyone  on  your  team  half-ass  it.  Y ou  set  the  bar ,  you  set  it  hi gh,  and  you expect  anyone  working  with  yo u  to  work  just  as  hard  and  level  up  to  what you expect or above. Anything less is unacceptable. When  Z hang  Ruimin  took  over  as  CEO  at  the  Qingdao  Ref rigerator Plant,  th e  precursor  to  the  appliance  company  Haier ,  the  compan y  was  close to  failure.  T o  send  a  clear  signal  to  his  new  employees,  Ruimin  gathered them  outside  to  witness  seventy-six  substandard  refrigerators  smashed  to pieces  b y  a  sledgehammer .  Ruim in  kept  a  sledgehammer  in  a  glass  case  in the  boardroom  for  the  remainder  of  his  tenure,  as  a  symbol  of  the  high standard he expected from the company . [2] Excellence Demands Excellence Masters  of  their  craft  don’ t  merely  want  to  check  of f  a  box  and  move  on. They’re  dedicated  to  what  they  do,  and  they  keep  at  it.  Master -level  work requires  near  fanatical  standard s,  so  masters  show  us  what  our  standards should  b e.  A  master  communica tor  wouldn’ t  accept  a  ponderous,  rambling email.  A  master  programmer  w ouldn’ t  accept  ugly  code.  Neither  of  them would accept unclear explanations as understanding. W e’ll  ne ver  be  exceptional  at  a nything  unless  we  raise  our  standards, both  of  ourselves  and  of  what’ s  possible.  For  most  of  us,  that  sounds  like  a lot  of  work.  W e   gravitate  toward  being  soft  and  complacent.  W e’d  rather coast.  That’ s  fine.  Just  realize  th is:  if  you  do  what  everyone  else  does,  you can  expect  the  same  results  that  everyone  else  gets.  If  you  want  dif ferent results, you need to raise the bar . W orking  with  a  master  firsthand  is  the  best  education;  it’ s  the  surest  way of  raisin g  the  bar .  Their  excellence  demands  your  excellence.  B ut  most  of us  aren’ t  lucky  e nough  to  have  that  opportunity .  Still,  not  all  is  lost.  If  you don’ t  ha ve  the  chance  to  work  with  a  master  directly ,  you  can  still  surround yourself  with  people  who  have  h igher  standards  by  reading  about  them  and their work.

Exemplars  can  be  people  you  w ork  with,  people  you  admire,  or   even people  w ho  lived  long  ago.  It  doesn’ t  matter .  What  matters  is   they make you better in a certain area, like a skill, trait, or value. (b)  Prac tice  imitating  them  in  certain  ways.  Create  space  in  the  moment to  r eflect  on  what  they’d  do   in  your  position,  and  then  act accordingly . Let’ s consider these components one at a time. In  th e  previous  s ection,  we  discussed  something  most  people  never  think about:  if  you  don’ t  curate  the  people  in  your  life,  the  people  who  end  up surrounding  you   will  be  there  by  chance  and  not  by  choice.  That  group includes  your  parents,  your  frien ds,  your  family ,  your  coworkers.  Sure,  your high  school  friends  might  be  great  examples  of  character  and  acumen,  but odds  are  they ’re  average.  Sure,  your  parents  might  be  some  of  the  sm artest businesspeople  in  the  world,  but  odds  are  they’re  not.  It’ s  not  that  you should  remove  these  people  from  your  life,  though;  contr olling  your environment just means intentionally adding exemplars into the mix. Y our Exemplars Show me your role models and I’ll show you your future. When  I  first  st arted  working  at  a  three-letter  intelligence  agency ,  I looked  up  to  my  colleague  Matt.  He  was  one  of  the  best  in  t he  world  at understanding  h ow  operating  systems  work  and  the  various  ways  you  can use  them  to  yo ur  advantage.  What  struck  me  most  about  Matt  was  his incredibly  high  standards.  Like  Michael  Jordan,  Matt  combined  natural talent  w ith  a  first-class  work  ethic.  And  he  demanded  perfectio n.  (Is  it  any wonder that he was one of the======================================================== confusing  fact  with  o pinion.  By trying on all the glasses, you see what others miss. When you’re getting information from other people, you need to keep an open mind. That means withholding your own judgment as long as possible. People  often  undermine  the  information-gathering  process  by  subjecting others  to  their  judgments,  beliefs,  and  perspective.  The  point  is n’ t  to  ar gue or  d isagree,  however .  Judging  p eople  and  telling  them  they’re  wrong  only shuts  th em  down  and  prevents  a  free  flow  of  information.  When  you’re gathering  information,  your  job  is  to  see  the  world  through  other  people’ s eyes.  Y ou’re  trying  to  understan d  their  experience  and  how  the y  processed it.  Y ou  can  learn  valuable  information  even  when  you  don’ t  agree  with  their view  of  the  world.  Just  ask  que stions,  keep  your  thoughts  to  y ourself,  and remain curious about other perspectives. S A F E  G  U A R D :   W hen  you  get  inf ormation  from  other  people,  ask  questions  that  yield detailed answers. Don’t ask people what they think; instead, ask them  how  they think. If  you  ask  people  what  to  do  in  a  given  situation,  you  might  ge t  the  correct answer ,  but  you  haven’ t  learned  anything.  Say  a  local  government  task force  needs  to  h ire  a  software  developer  for  a  project,  but  they  have  no experience  doin g  so  and  don’ t  know  what  to  look  for .  Person  A   on  the  task force  goes  to  a  developer  friend  and  asks,  “Whom  should  I  hire  for  this project?”  Person   B  does  the  same  but  instead  says,  “I’m  hiring  a  software developer ,  and  I’d  like  to  learn  from  your  experiences.  What  skills  matter and  whi ch  ones  can  be  learned  on  the  job?  Why?  Where  do  I  f ind  the  best people? How do I test these skills?” And so on. Person  B  might  not  have  a  recommendation  within  t he  first conversation,  bu t  I’d  give  it  ten-to-one  odds  that  they  find  a  bett er  candidate in  the  end.  The  reason:  Person  B  is  asking  about  the  principle s  that  guide decision-making  in  this  domain,  not  details  about  the  specific  ca se.  They’re asking others about their earned knowledge and making it their own. Our  goa l  in  decision-making  is  not  just  to  gather  information,  but  to gather  informat ion  relevant  to  our  decision.  That  requires  more  than building  an  inventory  of  data  points;  it  requires  understanding  t he  why  and how  beh ind  those  data  points—the  principles  that  good  decision-makers  use in this area. Getting  at  those  principles  requ ires  asking  the  right  kinds  of  questions. There are three I’d recommend: Question  1:   Wh at  are  the  variables  you’d  use  to  make  this  decision  if you were in my shoes? How do those variables relate to one another? Question  2:   What  do  you  know  about  this  problem  that  I  (or  other people)  don’ t?  What  can  you  see  based  on  your  experience  that someone  without  your  experienc e  can’ t?  What  do  you  know  that  most people miss? Question 3:   Wh at  w ould  be  your  process  for  deciding  if  you  were  in  my shoes?  H ow  wo uld  you  go  abou t  doing  it?  (Or:  How  would  you  tell your mother/friend to go about doing it?) Notice  how  dif ferent  these  qu estions  are  from  the  typical,  “Here’ s  my problem.  What  should  I  do?”  Remember:  the  questions  you  ask  help  to determine the quality of the information you get. Getting Accurate Information from Experts W e’ve  ta lked  ab out  the  importance  of  getting  high-fidelity  information.  The second  principle  for  getting  accurate  information  is  getting  high-expertise information: T H E   H I E X   P R I N  C  I P L E :   Get  high-expertise  (HiEx)  information,  which  comes  both  from people  with  a  lot  of  knowledge  and/or  experience  in  a  specific  area,  and  from  people with knowledge and experience in many areas. When  so meone  close  to  the  pro blem  isn’ t  available  to  you,  look   for  people who  recently  solved  a  similar  problem.  The  word  “recent”  is  an  important nuance  here.  When  you  want  specific  advice  from  an  expe rt,  look  for someone  who  recently  solved  t he  problem  you’re  trying  to  so lve.  Asking someone  who  solved  your  problem  twenty  years  ago  how  they  did  it  is  not likely  to  of fer  s pecific  and  ef fective  insights.  Y ou  want  a  current  expert— and no, I don’ t mean the talking heads on TV . They’re rarely actual experts. Experts  can  increase  the  accura cy  of  your  information  and  decr ease  the time  it  takes  to  g et  it.  Getting  ev en  one  expert’ s  advice  can  cut  through  a  lot of confusion and help you quickly formulate and/or eliminate options. I  l earned   the  value  of  expert  adv ice  firsthand  when  I  began  coding  at======================================================== inflation,  and  a  mission-focused   or ganization  full  of  incredibly  smart  and dedicated people. When  I  told  one   of  my  colleagu es  I  was  quitting,  they  looked  at  me  with surprise.  They  told  me  about  all   the  risks,  how  I’d  lose  my  golden  pension and  my   benefits.  They  focused  on  what  I  was  losing,  not  what  I  was gaining: mainly , the freedom of my time. Leaving  this  job  illustrates  the  four  strengths  in  action.  I  had  the  self- confidence  that  I  could  figure  out  what  came  next  without  needing  to  know all  t he  d etails,  th e  self-knowled ge  to  know  that  I  valued  time  o ver  money , the  self- control  to  get  up  the  next   day  without  missing  a  beat,  and  the  self- accountability  to  set  a  higher  standard  for  performance  than  I  ever  had before. W ithout  self-knowledge,  I  never  would  have  known  what  made  me happy .  W ithout  self-confidence,  I  never  would  have  left.  W ithout  self- accountability  and  self-control,  I  probably  would  have  known  what  to  work on,  but  I  would  have  filled  my  days  with  easy  busywork  ins tead  of  the activities that moved me forward. Example 2: Resisting the Social Default Suppose  you  know  from  experience  that  you’re  susceptibl e  to  social pressure.  On  numerous  occasio ns,  for  instance,  you’ve  been  cajoled  into buying  t hings  you  didn’ t  want  f rom  pushy  salespeople,  and  you’ve  agreed to  ta ke  on  jobs  you  didn’ t  have  t he  bandwidth  for  by  pushy  colleagues.  Y ou don’ t trust yourself to do better in the future using sheer willpower alone. T o  protect  yourself  from  the  influence  of  the  social  default,  you  decide to  im plement  a  safeguard.  Y ou  form  a  rule  for  yourself:  never  say  yes  to something important without thinking it over for a day . Practicing  this  safeguard  isn’ t  very  enjoyable.  Putting  someone  on  hold for  a  day  might  be  uncomfortable  in  the  moment,  but  the  long-term  results of  i mplementing  this  safeguar d  are  worth  it.  As  simple  as  they  seem, automatic  rules  for  common  situations  get  results.  W e’ll  explore  automatic rules in the next chapter . Implementing  this  plan  illust rates  all  four  of  the  strengths  I’ve mentioned.  Knowing  your  vulne rability  to  social  pressure  and  the  limits  of your  power  to  resist  it  requires  self-knowledge.  Deciding  to  do  something about  this  vulnerability  to  secure  better  outcomes  involves  self-confidence. Following  the  rule  you’ve  m ade  fo r  yourself  takes  self-accountability .  And overcoming  short-term  discomfort  in  ordinary  moments  for  long-term  gain displays self-control. [*] All  f our  of  these   strengths  are  ne cessary  for  resisting  the  influence  of  the social  default.  Once  you  have  them  all  working  together ,  you’l l  be  amazed at  what  you  can  accomplish.  Now  let’ s  take  a  look  at  how  to  build  those strengths. OceanofPDF .com CHAPTER 2.6 S e t t i n g   t h e   S t a n d a r d s It is inevitable if you enter into relations with people on a regular basis . . . that you will grow to be like them. . . . Place an extinguished piece of coal next to a live one, and either it will cause the other one to die out, or the live one will make the other reignite. . . . Remember that if you consort with someone covered in dirt you can hardly avoid getting a little grimy yourself. — E P I  C  T E T U S ,   D i s c o u r s e s T H E   F I R S T   S T E P   T O   B U I L D I N  G    A N Y   O F   Y O U R   S T R E N  G  T H S   I S   R A I S I N  G    T H E   S T A N D A R D S to  w hich  you  h old  yourself,  a  practical  matter  of  looking  around  at  the people and practices that pervade your day-to-day environment. Our  surroundings  influence  us—both  our  physical  environment  and  the people  around  us.  Few  things  are  more  important  in  life  than  avoiding  the wrong  p eople.  I t’ s  tempting  to  think  that  we  are  strong  enough  to  avoid adopting the worst of others, but that’ s not how it typically works. W e  unconsciously  become  wha t  we’re  near .  If  you  work  for  a  jerk, sooner  or  later  y ou’ll  become  one  yourself.  If  your  colleagues   are  selfish, sooner  or  later  you  become  selfish.  If  you  hang  around  someone  who’ s unkind,  you’ll  slowly  become   unkind.  Little  by  little,  you  adopt  the thoughts  and  feelings,  the  attitud es  and  standards  of  the  people  around  you. The changes are too gradual to notice until they’re too lar ge to address. Becoming  like  the  people  aroun d  you  means  that  over  time  you  come  to adopt  th eir  standards.  If  all  you   see  are  average  people,  you  will  end  up with average standards. But average standards aren’ t going to get you where you  want  to  go .  Standards  become  habits,  and  habits======================================================== Sometimes,  it  comes  from  a  track record  of  applying  deep  knowledge  successfully ,  and  other  times  it  comes from  the  shallowness  of  reading  an  article.  It’ s  amazing  how  often  the  ego turns unearned knowledge into reckless confidence. A  little  knowled ge  can  be  a  dangerous  thing,  as  one  of  my  kids  learned the  hard   way .  Not  wanting  to  write  out  his  homework  in  Fre nch,  which would  take  a  lo t  of  time  and  ef fort,  he  realized  he  could  wr ite  it  out  in English  and  put  it  through  an  o nline  translator .  When  I  asked  him  how  he finished  so  quickly ,  he  told  me  it  was  easy  and  left  it  at  that.  Of  course,  his French teacher realized what he had done and gave him a zero. Our  ego  tempts  us  into  thin king  we’re  more  than  we  a re.  Left unchecked,  it  can  turn  confidence  into  overconfidence  or  even  arrogance. W e  get  a  bit  of  knowledge  on  the  internet  and  suddenly  we  are  full  of hubris.  E verything  seems  easy .  As  a  result,  we  take  risks  that  we  may  not understand  we’re  taking.  W e  must  resist  this  kind  of  unearned  confidence, though, if we are to get the results we desire. Recently ,  after  a  talk  I  attended  on  the  growing  homeless  population,  the person  s itting  next  to  me  comm ented  on  how  easy  it  would  be  to  solve  this deep  an d  complex  issue.  He  was  intoxicated  with  a  little  unearned confidence,  based  on  shallow  understanding,  so  the  problem  seemed  simple to  h im.  However ,  those  with  co mpetence  based  on  hard-earned  knowledge didn’ t  think  the  problem  was  s imple  at  all.  They  were  fully  aware  of  the realities of the situation. Unearned  know ledge  rushes  us  to  judgment.  “I’ve  got  this,”  w e  think. W e  conv ince  ourselves  that  low-chance  events  are  zero-chance   events  and think  only  of  best-case  outcomes.  W e  feel  imm une  to  bad  luck—to  the  bad things  th at  happen  to  other  peo ple,  because  of  our  newfound  (and  false) sense of confidence. [1] Confidence  doe sn’ t  make  bad  outcomes  any  less  likely  or  good outcomes  more  likely ,  it  only  blinds  us  to  risk.  The  ego  also  makes  us  more concerned  with  maintaining  or  improving  our  perceived  position  in  a  social hierarchy than with extending our knowledge or skills. One  reason  people  find  it  hard  to  empower  others  at  work  is  tha t  having them  depend  on  us  for  every  decision  makes  us  feel  im portant  and indispensable.  H aving  them  depend  on  us  makes  us  feel  not  only  necessary but  pow erful.  T he  more  people  who  depend  on  us  the  more  p owerful  we feel.  Ho wever ,  this  position  is  o ften  self-defeating.  Slowly  and  then  all  at once we become a prisoner of the circumstances we created; more and more ef fort  is  needed  to  stay  in  the  s ame  place,  and  we  approach  th e  ceiling  of brute force. [*]  It’ s only a matter of time until things break. The  per son  who   wants  to  be  seen  as  great  shows  the  world  how  to manipulate  them.  W e’re  prone  to  being  less  concerned  with  actual  greatness than  wit h  exuding  the  appearance  of  greatness.  When  someone  steps  on how  we   see  ourselves  (or  how  we  want   to  be  s een),  the  ego  leaps  int o action,  and  we  often  react  wit hout  reasoning.  Carlo  Rizzi  is  a  fictional example, but there are many real ones. In  Septe mber  1780,  for  instance,  the  American  general  Benedict  Arnold secretly  met  a  British  spy .  In  exchange  for  £20,000  and  a  British  military command,  Arno ld  agreed  to  gi ve  the  British  control  of  the  fort  at  W est Point, which was then under his command. What  po werful  force  could  make  someone  betray  his  country?  Arnold’ s reason  was  the  same  as  Carlo  Rizzi’ s:  long-harbored  resentment  about  his social standing. Arnold  had  been  an  accompl ished  military  of ficer ,  but  he  wasn’ t generally  well-liked.  He  had  a  jealous  disposition  and  frequently complained  about  Congress  promoting  younger ,  less  competent  of ficers ahead  o f  him.  He  was  quick  to  react  to  social  slights,  both  real  and imagined.  And  his  tendency  to  prove  his  superiority  by  humiliating  people with whom he disagreed created an invisible army of enemies. He  nevertheless   managed  to  e arn  the  confidence  of  the  Co ntinental Army’ s  commander  in  chief,  Geor ge  W ashington,  who  appointed  Arnold military  govern or  of  Philadelphia.  Around  this  time,  Arnold  sought  the hand of Peggy Shippen, the daughter of a wealthy Philadelphia family . The  Shippens  were  loyalist  sympathizers  interested  in  making connections  only  with  similarly   wealthy  people.  Arnold,  however ,  was  not wealthy .  His  alcoholic  father  had  squandered  the  family======================================================== .cbssports.com/nfl/news/super -bowl- 49-pete-carrolls-decision-astonishing-explanation-perplexing/ .

Perhap s  you  thought  instead  about  how  at  least  some  of  that  time could  ha ve  been  used  connecting  with  family  and  friends,  or  writing  that book you always wanted to write. Y ou  mig ht  reme mber  the  times  you  fell  short  of  the  person  you   wanted to  be —we  all  have  done  so  at  one  point  or  another .  Perhaps  it  w as  the  time you  sent  an  in appropriate  ema il,  or  the  time  you  lost  control  of  your emotions  and  yelled  at  someone   you  love.  Maybe  it  was  the  time  you  said something  you  didn’ t  mean  ju st  to  cause  a  reaction  in  the  o ther  person because  you  didn’ t  know  how ,  i n  that  moment,  to  tell  them  you  loved  them or  h ow  scared  y ou  were.  Or  p erhaps  it  was  the  time  someone  said  they needed you, and you were too busy with your own priorities to help. Y ou  might  think  of  the  impact—or  lack  of  it—that  you  had  on  your community ,  you r  city ,  your  cou ntry ,  or  the  world.  Y ou  might  think  of  your health.  D id  you  do  everything  you  could  to  prepare  your  body  to  live  to eighty , ninety , one hundred? Did you take care of yourself so you could take care of others? What  we  think  of  as  defining  moments,  like  promotions  or  a  new  house, matter  le ss  to  life  satisfaction  than  the  accumulation  of  tiny  moments  that didn’ t  se em  to  matter  at  the  ti me.  In  the  end,  everyday  mom ents  matter more than big prizes. T iny delights over big bright lights. OceanofPDF .com CHAPTER 5.4 L i f e   L e s s o n s   f r o m   D e a t h It is not that we have a short time to live, but that we waste a lot of it. — S E N E  C  A ,   O n   t h e   S h o r t n e s s   o f   L i f e ,    C  h a p t e r   1 E V A L U A T I N  G    Y O U R   L I F E   T H R O U  G  H   T H E   L E N S   O F   Y O U R   D E A T H   I S   R A W ,  P O W E R F U L , and  perhaps  a  b it  scary .  What  matters  most  becomes  clear .  W e  become aware  of  the  ga p  between  who  we  are  and  who  we  want  to  be.  W e  see where  w e  are  and  where  we  want  to  go.  W ithout  that  clari ty ,  we  lack wisdom and waste the present on things that don’ t matter . When  I  do  this  thought  experim ent,  I  gain  a  more  objective  perspective on my life. It makes me want to become a better version of myself. Initially ,  what  comes  to  mind  are  the  things  I  want  to  do  for  others.  W as I  the re  w hen  the   people  I  love  needed  me?  Did  I  make  time  for  the  people closest  to  me?  A m  I  the  partner   that  I  want  to  be—loving,  supportive,  and true  to  my  hopelessly  romantic  and  cheesy  side?  W as  I  a  good  father?  Did  I travel  and  see  the  world?  Could  people  count  on  me?  W as  I  an  active participant  in  the  community?  D id  I  help  people  accomplish  th eir  dreams? Did I leave the world a better place? When  you  know  the  destination ,  how  to  get  there  becomes  clearer .  As Aristotle  says,  “Knowledge  of  the  best  good  carries  great  weight  for knowing  the  best  way  to  live:  i f  we  know  it,  then  like  archers  who  have  a tar get to aim at, we are more likely to hit the right mark.” [1] At  some   point  my  kids  figured   out  that  it  was  easier  to  solve   a  maze backward  than  forward,  espe cially  if  the  maze  is  harde r  or  more complicated than usual. Something about starting with the end in mind, they realized,  makes  it  easier  to  decide  which  path  to  take.  Life  in  general  works similarly . If  this  were  you r  final  year  of  life,  would  you  be  living  the  sa me  way you  are  today?  I   posed  this  ques tion  to  a  friend  of  mine  over  lunch  one  day , and  he  quickly  r etorted,  “I’d  spend  my  savings,  run  up  my  credit  cards,  and start a drug habit.” (He was joking about the drugs. I hope.) When  you  think  of  your  ninety-year -old  self,  it  becomes  clear  that running  up  your  credit  card  or  d oing  drugs  isn’ t  going  to  make  you  happier . For  man y  peopl e,  considering  death  makes  us  less  likely  to  want  to  blow money . [2]   (Th e  downside  of  drugs  is,  I  tru st,  self-explanatory .)  And  I’m  sure you  wouldn’ t  spend  your  final  year  checking  email,  putting  other  people down,  or  trying  to  show  your  uncle  just  how  right  you  were  that  one Thanksgiving when you ar gued about politics. When  you  imagine  your  older  self  and  what  you  want  your  life  to  look like  in  hindsight,  you  stop  thin king  about  the  small  things  tha t  encourage you  to  be  reactive  instead  of  proactive.  Y ou  start  to  see  what  actually matters to you. The small things look small, and the things that really matter start  to  look  big.  From  this  perspective,  it’ s  easier  to  navigate  toward  the future  y ou  really  want.  Y ou======================================================== practica l,  actionable  ways  to  both  m anage  your weaknesses  and   build  your  strengths  so  that  space  is  consiste ntly  created when you’re under pressure. The  seco nd  half   of  the  book  is  a bout  putting  clear  thinking  into  practice. Once  you  are  in  a  place  where  you’ve  shored  up  your  strengths  and managed  your  weaknesses—when  you’ve  created  the  pau se  between thought  and  action—you  can  turn  clear  thinking  into  ef fective  decisions.  In Part 4 I share the most practical tools you can use to solve problems. Finally ,  once  you  have  mastered  the  skills  of  making  your  defaults  work for  inste ad  of  against  you  and  maximizing  the  tool  that  is  y our  rational mind,  I’ ll  turn  to  perhaps  the  most  important  question  of  all:  the   question  of what  yo ur  goals  are  in  the  first  place.  All  the  successful  exec ution  in  the world  is  worthless  if  it’ s  not  in  s ervice  of  the  right  outcome,  but  how  do  you decide what that is? Along  th e  way ,  I’ll  show  you  th e  most  ef fective  approaches  to  thinking in  a  way  few  peo ple  talk  about.  W e  won’ t  use  fancy  jar gon,  spre adsheets,  or decision  trees.  Instead,  we’ll  foc us  on  the  practical  skills  I’ve  learned  from others,  d iscovered  on  my  own,  and  tested  on  thousands  of  people  from various or ganizations, cultures, and industries. T ogether  we’ll  uncover  the  miss ing  link  between  behavioral  science  and real-world results and turn ordinary moments into extraordinary results. The  less ons  in  this  book  are  sim ple,  practical,  and  timeless.  They  draw heavily  on  the  wisdom  of  others  and  my  own  lived  experience  putting  them into  prac tice.  I  relied  on  these  le ssons  and  insights  to  make  bett er  decisions inside  th e  intelligence  agency ,  build  and  scale  multiple  businesses,  and surprisingly become a better parent. How you use them is up to you. If  there  is  a  tagline  to  my  life,  it  is  “Mastering  the  best  of  wh at  other people  have  already  figured  out,”  and  this  book  is  a  tribute  to  that  belief. I’ve  don e  my  best  to  attribute  those  ideas  to  the  people  who  deserve  the credit.  I’ ve  prob ably  missed  some,  and  for  that  I  apologize.  When  you  put things  in to  pract ice,  they  become  part  of  you.  After  two  decades,  thousands of  conve rsations  with  the  best  in   the  world,  and  more  books  devoured  than  I can  count,  it’ s  not  easy  to  remember  where  everything  comes  from.  Most  of it  has  just  been  ingrained  into  my  unconscious.  It’ s  safe  to  assume  that anything  useful   in  this  book  is  someone  else’ s  idea,  and  that  my  main contribution  is  to  put  the  mosaic   of  what  I’ve  learned  from  others  who  came before me out there for the world. OceanofPDF .com I N T R O D U  C  T I O N The Power of Clear Thinking in Ordinary Moments W H A T   H A P P E N S   I N   O R D I N A R Y   M O M E N T S   D E T E R M I N E S   Y O U R   F U T U R E . W e’re  ta ught  to  focus  on  the  big  decisions,  rather  than  the  m oments where  w e  don’ t  even  realize  we’re  making  a  choice.  Y et  these  ordinary moments  often  matter  more  to  our  success  than  the  big  decisions.  This  can be dif ficult to appreciate. W e  think  that  if  only  we  get   the  big  things  right,  everyth ing  will magically  fall  into  place.  If  we  choose  to  marry  the  right  person,  it’ll  all  be okay .  If   we  choose  the  right  career ,  we’ll  be  happy .  If  we  pick  the  right investment,  we’ll  be  rich.  This  wisdom  is,  at  best,  partially  true.  Y ou  can marry  the  most  amazing  person  in  the  world,  but  if  you  tak e  them  for granted,  it  will  end.  Y ou  can  pick  the  best  career ,  but  if  you  don’ t  work  your butt  of f,  you  wo n’ t  get  opportunities.  Y ou  can  find  the  perfect  investment, only  to  look  at  y our  savings  account  and  have  nothing  to  invest.   Even  when we  g et  t he  big  decisions  directio nally  right,  we’re  not  guaranteed  to  get  the results we want. W e  d on’ t  think  of  ordinary  moments  as  decisions.  No  one  taps  u s  on  the shoulder  as  we  react  to  a  comment  by  a  coworker  to  te ll  us  that  we’re  about to  pour  either  gasoline  or  water   onto  this  flame.  Of  course,  if  w e  knew  we were  ab out  to  make  the  situatio n  worse,  we  wouldn’ t.  No  one  tries  to  win the moment at the expense of the decade, and yet that is often how it goes. The  enemies  of  clear  thinking—the  more  primal  parts  of  our  nature— make  it  hard  to  see  what’ s  happening  and  instead  just  make  our  lives  more challenging.  Wh en  we  react  wit h  emotion  to  a  colleague  in  a  m eeting,  we must  make  amends.  When  we  make  a  decision  to  prove  we’re  right
